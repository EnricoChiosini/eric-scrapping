AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the potential implementation of the design thinking-STEAM-PjBL model to influence pre-service chemistry teachers' transferable skills. The design thinking process is integrated into an interdisciplinary curriculum STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) designed to engage pre-service chemistry teacher in creative and innovative contextual problem-solving through project-based learning (PjBL). Thirty-nine first-year students in the chemistry education study program, at Universitas Negeri Jakarta engaged in the study. Researchers used qualitative methods to understand the pre-service chemistry teachers' experiences and the implications for their skills development. Data was collected through semistructured interviews, reflective journals, researcher's notes, and classroom observation. Through five stages of design thinking: empathise, define, ideate, prototype, and test, pre-service chemistry teacher engaged in reflecting on their content knowledge to understand the rising temperature in Jakarta as an issue to be resolved. The results show that collaborative problem-solving activities develop informed and integrative thinking that leads participants to communicate clearly and effectively, and to creative unique solutions. In addition, the participants' degree of empathy encouraged them to build a sense of responsibility to contribute to the context of their environment. Thus, the practice of the design thinking-STEAM-PjBL model leads participants to become independent learners.

AB  - When the Learning Sciences emerged in 1991, there was an ethos of studying learning in humans and machines in conjunction with one another. This ethos reflected three decades of prior work on the interdisciplinary study of learning; however, in the three decades since the emergence of the Learning Sciences, it seems to have largely disappeared. I begin by describing the ethos that was prevalent in 1991 using quotations from the inaugural editorial of the "Journal of the Learning Sciences." I then describe how this ethos was prevalent decades before the Learning Sciences in four distinct approaches to cognitive science research, which I call the "Four C's"--cognitivism, constructivism, cybernetics, and connectionism. I suggest three reasons why the Learning Sciences moved away from the use of artificial intelligence as a central tool for thinking about learning, noting that these reasons do not suggest a fundamental incompatibility between the two. I end by discussing how Learning Scientists might once again embrace artificial intelligence and computational modeling and use them as tools for gaining insight into the constructivist, situated, and socio-cultural nature of learning.

AB  - Building from a panel at the 2022 National Communication Association (NCA) annual convention, the present article seeks to ground communication studies/sciences as central to interdisciplinary conversations surrounding sexuality education and communication. Communication is integral to sexuality education, and topics of communication, sex, and sexuality education are researched across disciplines. Still, research on sexuality education within communication studies remains under-attended, and interdisciplinary sexuality education research remains siloed by academic discipline. Presenting a forum featuring both emerging and leading scholars in the field of communication researching sex(uality) education, the present article seeks to establish the academic discipline of communication as integral to research on sexuality education. To do so, we first discuss communication as an academic discipline and its advancements in sexuality education research. Next, communication scholars offer their expertise in sex(uality education) communication topics including family conversations, cultural influence, health inequities in education, and medicine. Collectively, these perspectives offer an understanding of current sexual health research in the field of communication, as well as next steps through direct application to conversations about sex, improvement to our medical and education systems, and community-based education and intervention. It is our hope that this article fosters a larger conversation about the importance of communication (studies/sciences) in sexuality education.

AB  - A designed segment of multidisciplinary co-teaching was used to activate a process of professional decision-making and study undergraduate students' perception of this skill development. A questionnaire was constructed to analyse students' perception of the process of decision-making and to reflect on the contribution of designed teaching to development of this competence. Students in our study had difficulties in perceiving, analysing, and monitoring the decision-making process. They had positive reactions, recognised contributions to their personal and professional development and perceived lack of classes for practicing complex competencies, during bachelor studies. To be able to expect some lasting effects, it is necessary for the development of these competencies to become a regular part of the curriculum and teaching practice, but also assessment of student achievement.

AB  - In higher education institutions, critical race theory (CRT) is known to be associated with fields that study racial disparities or systemic oppression such as law, education, and ethnic studies. The impression that CRT is unrelated to fields like business or computer science may have led scholars and practitioners from these disciplines to put their focus on elsewhere than on racial inequality and its implication in their research and practice, despite apparent need. To counter such fallacy, this review article--focusing primarily on the US context--discusses CRT literature in fields where its presence is less known which are nevertheless among the major domains of higher education institutions: health sciences, computer science and information technology, sports, business, and religion. By discussing example research of how scholars have utilized CRT in different fields to challenge the race-neutral thinking that often obscures structural racism, this paper exposes racism's ability to alter manifestations and to appear through various shapes and forms within the higher education context. Initial recommendations on how educators may engage in further discussions or actions will also be considered. This paper concludes that racist ideologies are often hidden behind discipline-specific vocabulary or technical language, and it is by tackling the ideologies at work underneath the technicalities can we address the chameleon-like nature of racism more effectively.

AB  - Integrating faith with academic disciplines should result in enrichment of students' perspectives on both the discipline and their faith. This quasi-experimental pilot study examines how faith integration activities in introductory physics classes affected students' epistemologies, defined as their beliefs about the nature of knowing and learning. The faith integration activities consisted of daily in-class discussions of characteristics of scientists, including comparisons and contrasts of typical traits of scientists with traditional Christian virtues. Changes in students' epistemologies throughout their first semester of introductory physics were measured using the Epistemological Beliefs Assessment for the Physical Sciences (EBAPS) survey. Previous research has shown that in a typical introductory physics class, students' epistemological beliefs become less expert-like. Comparing students who received the intervention with those that did not, students' EBAPS scores decreased without the intervention, although the typical decreases did not occur with the intervention. The largest improvement occurred on students' beliefs on the source of ability to learn, which was emphasized in the in-class discussions. Moreover, students in the first quartile by EBAPS pre-score showed decreases in the source of ability to learn score without intervention, but gains in the source of ability to learn axis with intervention. These results indicate that the faith integration intervention produced results of value to the discipline by preventing the typical degradation in students' epistemologies, with the largest benefit to students at risk of not persisting in STEM because of epistemological barriers.

AB  - My remarks will outline, from a philosopher's perspective, challenges and opportunities that I see for a science of virtue. I will touch on three topics: (1) ensuring that the studies are philosophically useful; (2) grappling with issues of measurement; and (3) next steps in moving a science of virtue forward. I approach (1) and (2) through reflections on some recent uses of psychology by philosophers and of philosophy by psychologists; and will argue in part (3) that next steps should entail certain kinds of educational efforts to promote interdisciplinary research. An example is that recently undertaken in a program by the Society of Christian Philosophers that offers opportunities for focused psychological training to philosophy graduate students. These and similar efforts could have far-reaching impacts for the emergence of a philosophically informed science of virtue.

AB  - A strong theoretical approach with a specific focus on disciplinary research characterizes the common science master's education in the Netherlands. However, a work-based learning (WBL) approach may as well be expedient and suitable for science education at master's level. In this paper, a case study is presented of a WBL-program designed for an academic setting: the one year Science, Business and Policy (SBP) master's track, offered at the Faculty of Science and Engineering of the University of Groningen. The paper describes the design and curriculum of the track, including its underlying theoretical framework, courses, multidisciplinary projects and work placements. Based on the SBP-track's design we identified six possible indicators of a successful elaboration of an academic WBL-program: the SBP-track (1) is designed in response to the Bologna process; (2) is offered fully within the curriculum of a master's program of a research university; (3) requires a sufficient academic level and disciplinary knowledge at entr√©e; (4) follows an educational project approach; (5) focuses on the integration and implementation of knowledge; and (6) applies learning objectives that are specifically formulated to match the WBL educational method. A directed content analysis of SBP work placements revealed an increase in the number of SBP-students between 2003 and 2019, with an overrepresentation of life science students, as well as a large variety of real-case problems addressed for both business and policy organisations diverse in sector, size and region. Students' grades showed a positive correlation between the initial theoretical preparation and the report made during the work placement. In conclusion, the societal interpretation of the Bologna process has been implemented successfully with SBP, by combining academic learning with gaining professional experience using a WBL-approach.

AB  - Purpose: This research reveals how a virtual exchange (VE) can foster transnational collaboration in higher education, assist students acquire key learning outcomes and raise awareness regarding the complexities affecting development policy and sustainability. The purpose of this paper is to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Overall 50 students from two universities in Spain and the United Kingdom, enrolled on two different degree courses (Global Studies and Marketing), cooperated in multidisciplinary teams to analyze real development policies and initiatives. The authors collected quantitative and qualitative data to assess the students' perceptions of the methodology. Findings: The students perceived the VE to be of great value, enriching their educational experience by having a positive effect on their overall learning and fostering internationalization. A high number of participants declared the teaching and learning methodology was useful to assist them in reaching crucial cognitive, skill-based and affective educational objectives, and to help them understand how development policy works while also raising awareness regarding real-world complexity. Practical implications: This methodology proved valuable in helping students acquire the set of skills expected from today's graduates in economics, political science and marketing. This active learning and pedagogical innovation component provides some interesting conclusions contributing toward widening the adoption of VEs in higher education contexts. Originality/value: The increasing complexity of the globalized world makes it challenging for higher education institutions to develop multidisciplinary approaches to education to foster sustainable development. The experience provided offered the students an online international experience at their home institutions. Consequently, the research elaborates on how VE can be applied in economics, business, management and political science courses to enrich learning experience by applying theory in a practical way.

AB  - There is growing interest in how to better prepare K-12 students to work with data. In this article, we assert that these discussions of teaching and learning must attend to the human dimensions of data work. Specifically, we draw from several established lines of research to argue that practices involving the creation and manipulation of data are shaped by a combination of personal experiences, cultural tools and practices, and political concerns. We demonstrate through two examples how our proposed humanistic stance highlights ways that efforts to make data personally relevant for youth also necessarily implicate cultural and sociopolitical dimensions that affect the design and learning opportunities in data-rich learning environments. We offer an interdisciplinary framework based on literature from multiple bodies of educational research to inform design, teaching and research for more effective, responsible, and inclusive student learning experiences with and about data.

AB  - Purpose: Approaches to solving sustainability problems require a specific problem-solving mode, encompassing the complexity, fuzziness and interdisciplinary nature of the problem. This paper aims to promote a complex systems' view of addressing sustainability problems, in particular through the tool of network science, and provides an outline of an interdisciplinary training workshop. Design/methodology/approach: The topic of the workshop is the analysis of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a political action plan. The authors are interested in the synergies and trade-offs between the goals, which are investigated through the structure of the underlying network. The authors use a teaching approach aligned with sustainable education and transformative learning. Findings: Methodologies from network science are experienced as valuable tools to familiarise students with complexity and to handle the proposed case study. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work which uses network terminology and approaches to teach sustainability problems. This work highlights the potential of network science in sustainability education and contributes to accessible material.

AB  - Purpose: The article reconsiders and explicates the role of academia within and for society and suggests quality standards for normative research. Approach: The article analyses and discusses transdisciplinary procedures for citizenship education research in democracies. Findings: Paradigmatic decisions concerning ontology, axiology, epistemology, and methodology need to be made consciously and transparent. This professionalisation is necessary to ensure that the requirements of academic knowledge are met. Furthermore, the social responsibility of research needs to be acknowledged and methodologically taken into account. Implications: The article suggests three main quality aspects for normative research: transdisciplinarity, transparency, and reflection. It emphasises the ethical and epistemological challenges of research in democracies. Hence, there has to be a close focus on structures and power during the research in order to not just create any impact, but good impact.

AB  - There is an increasing interest in the integration of computational thinking (CT) in the K-12 curriculum. By integrating CT into other disciplines, the aim is to equip students with essential skills to navigate domain-specific challenges. This study conducts a systematic review of 108 peer-reviewed scientific papers to analyze in which K-12 subjects CT is being integrated, learning objectives, CT integration levels, instructional strategies, technologies and tools employed, assessment strategies, research designs and educational stages of participants. The findings reveal that: (a) over two-thirds of the CT integration studies predominantly focus on science and mathematics; (b) the majority of the studies implement CT at the substitution level rather than achieving a transformation impact; (c) active learning is a commonly mentioned instructional strategy, with block-based languages and physical devices being frequently utilized tools; (d) in terms of assessment, the emphasis primarily lies in evaluating attitudes towards technology or the learning context, rather than developing valid and reliable assessment instruments. These findings shed light on the current state of CT integration in K-12 education. The identified trends provide valuable insights for educators, curriculum designers, and policymakers seeking to effectively incorporate CT across various disciplines in a manner that fosters meaningful skill development with an interdisciplinary approach. By leveraging these insights, we can strive to enhance CT integration efforts, ensuring the holistic development of students' computational thinking abilities and promoting their preparedness for the increasingly interdisciplinary domains of digital world.

AB  - Though we live in a 4-dimensional universe, our minds and bodies are not particularly good at perceiving and depicting 4 dimensions. This study contributes to our understanding of collaboration with abstract concepts by examining particular activities where bodily and experiential understandings may conflict with the conceptual domain. Specifically, upper secondary physics classrooms studying Einstein's general theory of relativity are taken as a setting to identify the representational practices and conceptual challenges that arise when learners attempt to make meaning with, and express conflicting notions of, space and time. To unpack these challenges, we draw on the concept of imagination and on theoretical perspectives that treat imagining as a social activity. We also present the concept of metaimagining to characterize layered processes in which learners attend to and manage shifts between their own imaginative activities. This concept is illustrated through a detailed analysis of an extended conversation between 2 upper secondary physics students working with general relativity and spacetime. The students perform a diverse set of imaginative activities that are strongly tied to communicative, cognitive, and bodily action. We also show how the unique domain of general relativity presents particular challenges to student meaning making of abstract concepts which in turn prompt metaimagining. Based on our analysis, we offer recommendations to improve instructional practices in general relativity and argue for the consideration of imagining as a transdisciplinary competency in math and science education.

AB  - The present study examines the influence of individual competencies on knowledge integration in inter- and transdisciplinary work. Perspective taking, reflexivity, analogical reasoning, and tolerance of ambiguity and uncertainty were investigated as core competencies for fostering knowledge integration. Additional hypotheses assumed that the positive effects are valid in the scientific and economic contexts and that individual competencies predict knowledge integration at different levels of expertise. To test the hypotheses, 421 participants, comprised of students (N = 165) and individuals working in science (N = 152) and economics (N = 104), answered questionnaires on knowledge integration and competencies of knowledge integration in an online survey. Further questions collected demographic data and inquired about experience and expertise in inter- and transdisciplinary work. The main result was that all postulated competencies positively related to knowledge integration. Analogical reasoning and perspective taking showed the strongest relationships with knowledge integration. Further results show that all competencies are positively related to knowledge integration in the student and expert sample, yet the interrelationships differ between the scientific and economic sample. This investigation into the competencies of knowledge integration contributes to the education of inter- and transdisciplinarians in academia and business practice.

AB  - New liberal arts refer to the reorganization of traditional liberal arts to realize the intersection and integration within liberal arts and between liberal arts and natural sciences. The characteristics of new liberal arts are mainly problem-orientation, cross-integration, new technology application and innovative development. Under the background of new liberal arts, the implementation of interdisciplinary education in foreign language majors is an effective way for local colleges and universities to promote the construction of "new foreign languages" and the training of interdisciplinary and applied foreign language talents. Based on the connotations of new liberal arts and interdisciplinary education, and in view of the institutional and cultural barriers to the planning and implementation of interdisciplinary education, this paper proposes an optimized path for the design and implementation of interdisciplinary education for foreign language majors in local colleges and universities: deepen the integration between foreign language majors and other disciplines, build a staged, multi-level talent training system, set up cross-discipline curricular groups, apply new technology to transform traditional teaching and learning methods, strengthen the construction of interdisciplinary education platforms and faculties, and establish a foreign language interdisciplinary education system guarantee mechanism.

AB  - This article examines the possibility of supporting craft education by incorporating knowledge students have gained via science lessons: such knowledge largely refers to the mathematics and physics taught in Estonian comprehensive schools. Results were gleaned from interviews with craft teachers in Estonia, in order to establish their attitudes to the idea of integrating science with craft. Their ideas are presented here, along with a comparison of their understanding of the pedagogy. The results of the study address the following research questions: (1) Do teachers consider the National Curricula supportive, in terms of integrating science knowledge in order to support craft education?; (2) How do teachers recognise knowledge of science during craft processes?; (3) Are teachers aware when science is integrated into their teaching?; and (4) What do teachers consider the benefits of such integration? The research demonstrated the pedagogy of integrating knowledge of science with craft as a novel idea, based on a process of merging the two knowledge models. The result of this process is a development of a new area of knowledge that can both enable students' understanding and their design and fashioning processes. Moreover, it relates to realworld phenomena and thus helps students with their ideation. Such new knowledge is achievable when knowledge from one of the fields is used in the other field, whether science or craft. The integration of science with general craft education is dependent upon both the National Curricula and a teacher's method of teaching.

AB  - Continuous developments in the electronics industry have led to constantly changing career roles and graduate skills requirements. Students in the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) have complained that numerous courses in electronic engineering are heavily focused on theoretical knowledge that is disconnected from the needs of the industry. Thus, in an effort toward delivering student-centered educational programmes that meet the needs of the industry, this article introduces an innovative course that was developed using the project-based learning (PBL) method and situated in the electronic engineering undergraduate programme at UESTC. Since real-world engineering projects require teams to collaborate on ill-defined problems, we focused this innovative course on developing professional and technical skills, drawing from a range of more typical electronic engineering courses. We provide full details of two projects that were created for this PBL approach and evaluate them as practice examples that demonstrate the impact of this practical pedagogic innovation in UESTC. According to our evaluation, completed by all 40 of our enrolled students, our innovative course based on interdisciplinary PBL exercises demonstrated a significant improvement in student satisfaction and 65% of students preferred the interdisciplinary PBL course in comparison to traditional lecture-based courses.

AB  - Current environmental problems are the primary focus for environmental science students and researchers. Sustainable environmental solutions require interdisciplinary thought processes, which pose difficulty to both students and the public. Computational thinking is an emerging term emphasized by progressive science curricula. Computational thinking and environmental science are both interdisciplinary by nature. Learning about sustainable environmental solutions requires students to partake in computational thinking. These ideas lend toward an expansive learning progression that encourages scaffolded and differentiated student progress in both computational knowledge and environmental knowledge. The learning progression, which emerges from the conceptual framework, emphasizes the spheres of sustainability, research, education, and economic perspectives to support environmental science learning through computational thinking. Computational thinking emphasized by the computational components (input, integration, output, and feedback) support learning about environmental solutions within the learning progression. The learning progression promotes application and implications for educators, students, researchers, and environmental scientists.

AB  - This work examines how experiences in one disciplinary domain (biology) can impact the relationship a student builds with another domain (physics). We present a model for disciplinary relationships using the constructs of identity, affect, and epistemology. With these constructs we examine an ethnographic case study of a student who experienced a significant shift in her relationship with physics.We describe how this shift demonstrates (i) a stronger identification with physics, (ii) a more mixed affective stance towards physics, and (iii) more expertlike ways of knowing in physics. We argue that recruiting the student's relationship with biology into experiences of learning physics impacted her relationship with physics as well as her sense of how physics and biology are linked.

AB  - This article responds to Olof Franck's vision of a less didactic and more creative approach to Education for Sustainable Development. We consider how a multidisciplinary applied theatre project, bringing together Earth Sciences, Ancient Rock Art, storytelling, digital technology, and drama education knowledges and techniques can foster a more creative approach. The article is rooted in our analysis of the "African Rock Art: protecting the past, facilitating the future" project. We reflect on the challenges and possibilities of engaging with issues of climate crisis, responsibility, agency, and action in the Korogocho informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya.

AB  - There is a growing interest in engaging students and the general public about the meaning and objectives of doing science. When it is possible students can learn by actively engaging in the practices of science, conducting investigations, sharing ideas with their peers, teachers and scientists, learning to work with measuring apparatuses, to acquire and process data and use models so as to interpret phenomena. This is a process that requires a gradual collective growth. Schools and universities can both benefit from this cooperation. This paper presents activities of a project focusing on the radon survey in high schools. The ENVIRAD (environmental radioactivity) educational project involved about 2500 students and some tens of teachers in measurements while using solid state nuclear track detectors. This experience began about 15 years ago and is still carried out by various national projects managed by the same research group. The measurements and data analysis have been done in school laboratories and in the university radioactivity laboratory. Several hundred students were also involved in the transduction and signal processing. In some cases, pupils have also been involved in citizen awareness and the dissemination of this experience has kicked off a follow-up project explicitly addressed to citizens. The project has led to the opportunity to learn science through a real physics experiment. The students' enthusiasm allowed the collection of a relevant amount of data which benefitted both the regional survey on radon and the improvement of nuclear physics teaching at school. Through the project activities it was possible to recognize the interdisciplinary connections among different scientific disciplines connected to radioactivity.

AB  - In place of a traditional Advanced Placement Chemistry class at the high school where I teach, I have recently developed and implemented a year-long, interdisciplinary curriculum that presents typical inorganic chemistry topics in the context of their relevant applications in archeology, art history, studio art, and the investigation, authentication, restoration, and conservation of cultural heritage materials. One of the units in the new course explores the chemistry of pottery and includes curricular materials presented in three lessons and described here: (1) an introductory slideshow and a problem set that has students complete general stoichiometric and gas law calculations and examine SiO[subscript 2] specific gravity data, refractive index data, and phase diagrams related to chemical reactions that dehydrate kaolinite clay and temperature changes that produce SiO[subscript 2] phase transformations during firing, (2) a laboratory exercise that has students create their own pinch pots and coil pots and measure mass changes resulting from water lost during drying and bisque firing, and (3) a slideshow, web-based video resources, and case study that allow students to explore in detail the technically sophisticated, 3-stage (oxidizing--reducing--oxidizing, hereafter "ORO") firing process that was used to create aesthetically elegant, Athenian black- and red-figure vases starting in the sixth century BCE, and to conduct thermodynamic calculations to verify the plausibility of several dehydration and redox reactions that are thought to have produced characteristically colored minerals that have been observed both in ancient pots and in modern reproductions. These curricular materials represent a novel way to stimulate and engage students in the application of their chemistry skills and content knowledge in an interdisciplinary context and are suitable for use by teachers of general chemistry or interdisciplinary science and art classes in high schools, colleges, and universities.

AB  - The paper is situated within the theoretical and methodological framework of the the Joint Action Theory of Didactics (Sensevy, Le Sens du Savoir. El√©ments pour une Th√©orie de l'Action Conjointe en Didactique, De Boeck, 2011; Santini et al., Science & Education 27:921-961, 2018) and within the practice turn line of research on epistemic practices in science education. We investigate classroom practice seeking to achieve the concurrent learning of English as a foreign language together with disciplinary knowledge of physics as a practice. Classroom life is analyzed closely in order to identify traces of effective learning through epistemic practices (Santini et al., Science & Education 27:921-961, 2018; Kelly, Linder et al.√ñstman et al.Roberts et al.Wickman et al.Erikson et al.McKinnon (eds), Exploring the landscape of scientific literacy, Routledge, 2011) in both foreign language proficiency and discipline learning (Cunningham and Kelly, Science Education 101:486-505, 2017; Cunningham et al., Science Education 105:255-280, 2020). Founded on a Wittgensteinian concept of language, the notions of thought style and jargon are posited as useful notions to identify the epistemic value of classroom activity. This is in relation to the epistemic potential inherent in the situations presented in class, as well as the culturally constructed body of knowledge pertaining to the epistemic potential at stake. The modeling of classroom activity in this research rendered visible aspects of classroom practice which were essential to understanding the progression of knowledge objectives in situ, as well as the epistemic value of an actor's move in relation to the epistemic potential of a given context. The study concludes by positing the notions as efficient tools for both the analysis and design of learning environments, in particular for environments where language can be seen to be organically linked to the practice in which it is embedded (Collins, Social Studies of Science 41:271-300, 2011; Sensevy, G. Gruson, B., & Le H√©naff, C. (2019). Sur la notion de jargon. Quelques r√©flexions sur le langage et les langues. In C. Chaplier & A. -M. O'Connel (√âd.), √âpist√©mologie √† usage didactique.

AB  - The learning sciences inherently involve interdisciplinary research with an overarching objective of advancing theories of learning and to inform the design and implementation of effective instructional methods and learning technologies. In these endeavors, learning sciences encompass diverse constructs, measures, processes, and outcomes pertaining to both learning, motivation, and social interactions. These complex goals are further influenced by a large array of factors stemming from the learning context, learning task, and the characteristics of the individual learners. Learning occurs within a multitude of interacting contextual factors spanning variations between schools, teachers, classrooms, peers, and available technologies. These contexts also differ widely in diverse factors such as the social support that students receive, instructor engagement, demographic and ideological diversity, as well as instructional design strategies and affordances offered by educational technologies (Anderson & Dron, 2011). The learners themselves vary across a host of fixed factors such as age, grade level, ethnicity, and cultural background, as well as malleable individual differences such as engagement, interests, learning strategies, reading skills, and prior knowledge (Cantor et al., 2019; Jonassen & Grabowski, 2012; Winne, 1996).

AB  - This paper examines specific problems of educational practice that I, an undergraduate engineering educator and education researcher, have encountered in creating an interdisciplinary engineering project course. I reveal my process of theorising about problems of practice to position engineering educators' pedagogical theorising as worthy of scholarly focus. In a reflective scholarship of teaching and learning paradigm, I take the iterative design of this course as the object of inquiry, across semesters and institutional contexts. I discuss the iteration of five key dimensions of the course: (1) authenticity to engineering professional work, (2) promoting learning of teamwork skills, (3) complexities and equity dimensions of situated project-based learning environments, (4) valuing social sciences and social context reasoning for engineers, and (5) creating a responsive curriculum for students. I distil insights related to each of these dimensions. I conclude with a consideration of the interplay between these dimensions and a reflection on the form of scholarship for engineering education.

AB  - This study examined the presence of Scholarship of Teaching and Learning [SoTL] scholarship published in four refereed, disciplinary family science journals: "Family Science Review," "Journal of Marriage & Family," "Family Relations," and "Journal of Family Theory & Review" from 2009-2018. Results revealed that just two percent of all articles published in these journals during the period could be classified as SoTL, though clear differences between the journals and a recent upward trend were evident. Over 80% of the articles classified as SoTL appeared in "Family Science Review." Two-thirds of SoTL article authors were women and nearly 75% were from Carnegie Doctoral institutions. SoTL articles generally were unfunded and not widely cited. Findings are contextualized within the broader interdisciplinary SoTL literature. Implications for family science scholars and the future of family science SoTL scholarship are discussed.

AB  - Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) provide opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in authentic research and generally increase the participation rate of students in research. Students' participation in research has a positive impact on their science identity and self-efficacy, both of which can predict integration of students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), especially for underrepresented students. The main goal of this study was to investigate instructor-initiated CUREs implemented as upper-level elective courses in the Biomedical Sciences major. We hypothesized that these CUREs would (i) have a positive impact on students' scientific identity and self-efficacy and (ii) result in gains in students' self-assessed skills in laboratory science, research, and science communication. We used Likert-type surveys developed by Estrada et al. (14) under the Tripartite Integration Model of Social Influence to measure scientific identity, self-efficacy, and scientific value orientation. When data from all CUREs were combined, our results indicate that students' self-efficacy and science identity significantly increased after completion. Students' self-assessment of research and lab-related skills was significantly higher after completion of the CUREs. We also observed that prior to participation in the CUREs, students' self-assessment of molecular and bioinformatic skills was low, when compared with microbiological skills. This may indicate strengths and gaps in our curriculum that could be explored further.

AB  - Recent calls in biology education research (BER) have recommended that researchers leverage learning theories and methodologies from other disciplines to investigate the mechanisms by which students to develop sophisticated ideas. We suggest "design-based research" from the learning sciences is a compelling methodology for achieving this aim. Design-based research investigates the "learning ecologies" that move student thinking toward mastery. These "learning ecologies" are grounded in theories of learning, produce measurable changes in student learning, generate design principles that guide the development of instructional tools, and are enacted using extended, iterative teaching experiments. In this essay, we introduce readers to the key elements of design-based research, using our own research into student learning in undergraduate physiology as an example of design-based research in BER. Then, we discuss how design-based research can extend work already done in BER and foster interdisciplinary collaborations among cognitive and learning scientists, biology education researchers, and instructors. We also explore some of the challenges associated with this methodological approach.

AB  - Environmental science is a broad, interdisciplinary field integrating aspects of biology, chemistry, earth science, geology, and social sciences. Mastery of basic science concepts and reasoning are therefore necessary for students to understand the interactions of different components in an environmental system. How do teachers identify and assess the learning that occurs in introductory environmental science courses? In this article the authors introduce a pre-test and post-test in which students draw and label an ecosystem, showing interactions, terms, and concepts. The assignment is open-ended. The drawings can be a useful diagnostic tool for both the student and the teacher. They may also give insight into geographical, cultural, or social biases and provides a different way of assimilating and processing information. Ecosystem concepts seem to be a powerful way of capturing and reflecting student thinking about environmental settings as dynamic systems.

AB  - Over the past decade the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc. (ABET) has changed the general chemistry requirements to include a single introductory course for most engineering majors. There is a focus on outcomes that equip students with the ability to pass the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Exam and to work in multidisciplinary teams. In designing the experiments for the general chemistry laboratory (CHM2045L) at Florida Polytechnic University, our focus has been on nontraditional laboratories that emphasize fundamental science concepts that challenge the student in a "maker chemistry" project that (1) highlights traditional lecture concepts, (2) engages the student in an active design and build project, and (3) directly demonstrates the application of chemical sciences to their field of study and society's technological needs. The present work describes a novel chemistry laboratory in which students etch a printed circuit board (PCB) and solder light-emitting diodes (LEDs) onto the PCB to construct a working device in a 2 h laboratory session focused on oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions and LED band gap emission.

AB  - This edited volume brings together a state-of-the-art collection of leading and emergent research on the burgeoning topic of science identities. It sets out how science identity can be productively used as a lens in understanding patterns and inequalities in science participation across different educational and international contexts. Its chapters reveal how intersections of social identities and inequalities shape participation and engagement in science. Particular attention is given to explicating issues of theory and method, identifying the potential and limitations of approaches and lacunae in existing knowledge. The book showcases research from a range of disciplinary areas, employing diverse methodological and conceptual approaches to investigate science identities across different fields and settings. The collection offers a rich and comprehensive understanding of how science identity can be used conceptually, methodologically and analytically to understand how learners and teachers relate to, and make sense of, science. It's a valuable resource for students, researchers and academics in the field of science education and anyone who is interested in identity and education.

AB  - The Inclusive Environments and Metrics in Biology Education and Research (iEMBER) network is a newly forming national community of practice that engages diversity, equity, and inclusion stakeholders in interdisciplinary collaborative projects. iEMBER was initiated with incubator funding from the National Science Foundation program for Research Coordination Networks in Undergraduate Biology Education. In June 2017, biology education researchers, social scientists, biologists, and program and policy administrators, all with interests in diversity, equity, and inclusion, met to lay the foundation for the iEMBER network. iEMBER provides a distinct forum to coordinate efforts through networking, professional development, and the initiation of collaborative research. iEMBER advances science, technology, engineering, and mathematics reform focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion through the initiation of research teams at the iEMBER biennial conference and outreach efforts at discipline-specific meetings and conferences. The focus of iEMBER is on understanding how to create inclusive, supportive, and engaging environments to foster the success of all biology students and trainees. This report focuses on the structure of the iEMBER network, two takeaways that emerged from the 2017 conference (interdisciplinary networking/collaboration and intradisciplinary broadening participation strategies), and ways for prospective members to engage in ongoing dialogue and future events.

AB  - Contribution: This paper demonstrates curricular modules that incorporate engineering model-based approaches, including concepts related to circuits, systems, modeling, electrophysiology, programming, and software tutorials that enhance learning in undergraduate neuroscience courses. These modules can also be integrated into other neuroscience courses. Background: Educators in biological and physical sciences urge incorporation of computation and engineering approaches into biology. Model-based approaches can provide insights into neural function; prior studies show these are increasingly being used in research in biology. Reports about their integration in undergraduate neuroscience curricula, however, are scarce. There is also a lack of suitable courses to satisfy engineering students' interest in the challenges in the growing area of neural sciences. Intended Outcomes: (1) Improved student learning in interdisciplinary neuroscience; (2) enhanced teaching by neuroscience faculty; (3) research preparation of undergraduates; and 4) increased interdisciplinary interactions. Application Design: An interdisciplinary undergraduate neuroscience course that incorporates computation and model-based approaches and has both software- and wet-lab components, was designed and co-taught by colleges of engineering and arts and science. Findings: Model-based content improved learning in neuroscience for three distinct groups: 1) undergraduates; 2) Ph.D. students; and 3) post-doctoral researchers and faculty. Moreover, the importance of the content and the utility of the software in enhancing student learning was rated highly by all these groups, suggesting a critical role for engineering in shaping the neuroscience curriculum. The model for cross-training also helped facilitate interdisciplinary research collaborations.

AB  - This paper will provide several examples of science and mathematics integration: navigation/map-reading, ecology/ecosystems/population growth, and chemistry/molecular structures. This paper underscores integrating STEM subjects with problem-based learning with technology such as video/computer simulations/programming/coding and the dynamic free online software GeoGebra. The paper suggests some GeoGebra-based connections to the science and math that is taught and a way to connect the disciplines with technology. Science involves and uses mathematics, and both subjects involve problem solving, and math is the tool that science uses. Subsequently, integrating science and mathematics using problem-based learning with technology might be a way to improve science and mathematics instruction while building confidence for STEM. Recommendations for STEM teachers are made along with some GeoGebra illustrations.

AB  - Recent reforms have introduced integrated science, technology, engineering, and math education (STEM) that has highlighted an interdisciplinary approach to train students as better problem solvers. In addition to STEM disciplines, art, language, and other disciplines integration are also stressed (STEM+). In this paper, a STEM+ (STEM + art + entrepreneurship) activity was presented related to acid-base chemistry, specifically, pH indicator and strips designs. 13 junior pre-service chemistry teachers participated in the activity and produced indicator solutions from plant sources found easily at grocery stores and produced pH paper strips by the use of filter paper and coffee filters. After producing indicators and strips, participants were encouraged to marketing their products through product logo design and product advertisement. The activity is useful regarding learning acid-base chemistry, indicators and strips' properties, carrying out investigations, and designing solutions. The activity can also be easily applied to address high school physical science standards.

AB  - This laboratory experiment leverages the pedagogical value and multidisciplinary nature of biodiesel production from vegetable oil to introduce students to continuous-flow chemistry, a modern and rapidly growing approach to chemical synthesis. An interdisciplinary approach exposes students to the practical and conceptual aspects of modern continuous-flow chemistry while simultaneously reinforcing core organic chemistry techniques and investing students in issues of sustainability. Students screen reaction conditions in flow through an inquiry-guided approach and make evidence-based decisions to accomplish the sustainable conversion of waste cooking oil into biofuel. The laboratory experiment is designed to be highly modular and can be completed in two, three, five, or eight laboratory periods. By incorporating the burgeoning field of continuous-flow chemistry into the educational infrastructure, the experiments allow students to develop skills that are highly valued in the modern chemical workforce.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness level of the Provus-Alkin-amalgamation evaluation application based on Weighted-Product-"Rwa-Bhineda" modification through the results of field trials. This evaluation application was an evaluation tool formed by a combination of educational evaluation models (Provus model and Alkin model), decision support system methods (weighted product), and the concept of Balinese local wisdom ("Rwa Bhineda"). This research approach was developed, using the Borg and Gall model. The focus of the development phase in this study was field trials and revisions to field trials. The tool used to provide scores by respondents in field trials was a questionnaire. Subjects involved in field trials were 164 respondents. The research location was at several IT vocational schools in Bali. Data analysis was done by comparing the results of field trials with effectiveness standards referring to a five scale. The results showed that the percentage of effectiveness was 81.20%. It proved that the Provus-Alkin-amalgamation evaluation application based on Weighted-Product-"Rwa-Bhineda" modification was good. The impact of the results of this research is as a trigger to develop innovations in educational evaluation by integrating various fields of science (multidisciplinary science) in the form of one digital application.

AB  - Active learning activities offer opportunities for medical students to facilitate the retention of knowledge and develop soft skills. We aimed to create a guide for an interdisciplinary mock trial learning activity within the medical curriculum of the College of Medicine, Anhembi Morumbi University--Laureate International Universities, Sao Paulo, Brazil. We designed an "Animal Experimentation Mock Trial" in which students are coached to search for scientific, legal, and ethical arguments pro and contra animal experimentation in medical research. The mock trial is prepared and staged with student teams to play the 1) presiding judge, 2) the plaintiff's attorney and expert witnesses contra animal research, 3) the defense attorney and expert witnesses pro animal research, and 4) the jury. The plaintiff and defense teams made presentations, and between each presentation the jury put questions to presenters (cross-examination). The jury team gave two evaluation scores after the plaintiff's presentation and then after the defense presentation. The formal feedback for this active learning activity indicated that students expressed satisfaction with the teaching strategies employed in the course. The mock trial with the lesson plan provides a learning mean to exemplify the complex relationship between animal experimentation, medical evidence, ethics, and law/regulations. This mock trial helps medical students to develop their soft skills, such as the ability to collaborate and also to recognize the limits of their own knowledge, important for professional development. The importance of interdisciplinary discussions is demonstrated by increasing the awareness of the multidisciplinary aspect of animal research.

AB  - Purpose: The sustainability of the global food system hinges on its environmental resiliency and safety, including the health and well-being of its labor force. Single disciplinary courses in liberal arts or science often fail to highlight the overlap between environmental and social vulnerabilities that lead to food insecurity and diminish the sustainability of food systems. This paper aims to present the design and delivery of a successfully co-taught, interdisciplinary module on agricultural labor and sustainable food systems as a case study. Design/methodology/approach: The authors designed a co-taught module in which they joined each other's respective history and science class sessions at the undergraduate business college where they teach. Innovating the cross-disciplinary content of food security, immigration status, labor exploitation and pesticide exposure, they approached sustainability from the disciplinary perspectives of labor history and environmental science to show how these elements had both unique and overlapping impacts across food systems levels. Comparisons between pre- and post-module survey responses, alongside assessments of a co-authored exam question, measured the effectiveness of this module is changing students' perspectives as food consumers and as citizens. Findings This module altered students' understanding and perspectives around issues of food systems sustainability. Assessments indicated that students increased their awareness of agricultural workers at the front end of the food system, during production; students also gained awareness beyond consumption as they came to see the connections between workforce invisibility and ecosystem degradation. Originality/value: These insights are valuable to educators at all institutional levels who seek to collaborate on sustainability initiatives and teaching, both in the singular, robust modules and in building modules that will lead to the development of entire courses focused on sustainability. The module described here builds on previous demonstrations of the value, significance and effectiveness of cross-disciplinary collaborations; it pioneers the use of the food system as the link between social and environmental sustainability education.

AB  - In this paper, I propose an analysis of the structure of Clairaut's "√âl√©ments de G√©om√©trie" (1741), a book presenting geometrical knowledge organized around problems, with rich metadiscourse connecting problems and other elements of mathematical content. This analysis is inspired both by the "Series of problems at the crossroad of cultures" interdisciplinary history of sciences project, in which texts from various cultures structured around problems were analysed, and by ongoing mathematics educational research on the Hungarian "Guided Discovery" approach, where "series of problems" play a central role in the planning and implementation of teaching trajectories. I show how a dialog between the analysis of Clairaut's historical text and mathematics educational research contributes to the reflection on the construction and analysis of inquiry based teaching trajectories in mathematics education.

AB  - The biomaterials science has advanced in a high speed with global science and technology development during the recent decades, which experts predict to be more obvious in the near future with a more significant position for medicine and health care. Although the three traditional subjects, such as medical science, materials science and biology that act as a scaffold to support the structure of biomaterials science, are still essential for the research and education of biomaterials, other subjects, such as mechanical engineering, mechanics, computer science, automatic science, nanotechnology, and Bio-MEMS, are playing more and more important roles in the modern biomaterials science development. Thus, the research and education of modern biomaterials science should require a logical integration of the interdisciplinary science and technology, which not only concerns medical science, materials science and biology, but also includes other subjects that have been stated above. This article focuses on multidisciplinary nature of biomaterials, the awareness of which is currently lacking in the education at undergraduate stage. In order to meet this educational challenge, we presented a multidisciplinary course that referred to not only traditional sciences, but also frontier sciences and lasted for a whole academic year for senior biomaterials undergraduate students with principles of a better understanding of the modern biomaterials science and meeting the requirements of the future development in this area. The course has been shown to gain the recognition of the participants by questionnaires and specific "before and after" comments and has also gained high recognition and persistent supports from our university. The idea of this course might be also fit for the education and construction of some other disciplines.

AB  - Background: One approach to enhancing the pedagogy of science education is to employ academics who are not only science-trained but also engaged in education research. As some academics begin their Scholarship of Teaching and Learning research careers with a pure science background, shifting in disciplinary perspectives can be a source of professional tension. The pedagogic frailty model provides a framework that helps us to integrate institutional efforts to enhance teaching improvements by maintaining a simultaneous focus on critical areas that are thought to impede academic development. Purpose: This paper draws attention to the importance of disciplinary crossover by uncovering and comparing academics' teaching perspectives, views and beliefs from three disciplines: natural science (chemistry), social science (education) and science education. Method: Through a case study design using the pedagogic frailty model and concept map-mediated interviews as a tool, three academics engaged in a non-linear discourse in which their conceptions could be visualised and analysed. Findings and Discussion: Analysis of the case study interviews indicated that the academics' conceptions of teaching were highly individualised. The discourse surrounding the curriculum, and the embeddedness of and connection between pedagogy and discipline, were both subject-sensitive and influenced by professional backgrounds and research areas. On the other hand, because they operated under the same institutional values and regulations, we found a considerable overlap in terms of how the academics perceived the tensions between research and teaching and academic leadership. By comparing three academics who were at a different stage in the journey from disciplinary experts (chemistry) to teaching expert (education), we were able to uncover and understand more about the ways that the teaching environment impacted upon their practices. The science educator shared aspects of the other two perspectives, which suggests that his profile was a transitory state in comparison with the chemist and the educationist. Conclusion: The findings provide a glimpse of the distinctive nature of the values that underpin teaching and offer insights that can be used to promote dialogue about quality enhancement in science education.

AB  - Background: Recent developments in STEM and computer science education put a strong emphasis on twenty-first-century skills, such as solving authentic problems. These skills typically transcend single disciplines. Thus, problem-solving must be seen as a multidisciplinary challenge, and the corresponding practices and processes need to be described using an integrated framework. Purpose: We present a fine-grained, integrated, and interdisciplinary framework of problem-solving for education in STEM and computer science by cumulatively including ways of problem-solving from all of these domains. Thus, the framework serves as a tool box with a variety of options that are described by steps and processes for students to choose from. The framework can be used to develop competences in problem-solving. Sources of evidence: The framework was developed on the basis of a literature review. We included all prominent ways of domain-specific problem-solving in STEM and computer science, consisting mainly of empirically orientated approaches, such as inquiry in science, and solely theory-orientated approaches, such as proofs in mathematics. Main argument: Since there is an increasing demand for integrated STEM and computer science education when working on natural phenomena and authentic problems, a problem-solving framework exclusively covering the natural sciences or other single domains falls short. Conclusions: Our framework can support both practice and research by providing a common background that relates the ways, steps, processes, and activities of problem-solving in the different domains to one single common reference. In doing so, it can support teachers in explaining the multiple ways in which science problems can be solved and in constructing problems that reflect these numerous ways. STEM and computer science educational research can use the framework to develop competences of problem-solving at a fine-grained level, to construct corresponding assessment tools, and to investigate under what conditions learning progressions can be achieved.

AB  - Near-Peer Mentoring (NPM) is an innovative form of Peer-assisted Learning that has been gaining traction in educational settings. Traditionally, NPM is characterized by a more experienced student (typically a year or more advanced) offering guidance and support to newer, less experienced students, with the aim of helping them navigate the complexities of their educational journey. This concept, however, has evolved to encompass a more inclusive and interdisciplinary approach, wherein students from different fields share their expertise, enhancing the learning experience for all involved. Research has shown that near-peer groups can significantly ease the stress associated with transitioning into higher education environments. Additionally, they play a crucial role in fostering cognitive and psychomotor development in students. The benefits of peer mentoring extend beyond academic development, contributing to a stronger sense of belonging to the educational institution, increasing student success and retention rates, and enhancing science identity and self-efficacy. In a practical application of this concept, a NPM program was implemented in an Interior Design undergraduate program at a southwestern university. The program was designed with several objectives improving student retention, reducing the workload of studio instructors, creating learning opportunities through near-peer interactions (such as workshops and brown bag sessions), and fostering a sense of belonging within the department. The outcomes of this initiative were encouraging, indicating that near-peer mentorship positively influenced students' academic motivation, sense of belonging, and confidence in their abilities, skills, and knowledge pertaining to the college environment.

AB  - Generally, cohorts or learning communities enrich higher learning in students. Learning communities consist of conventionally separate groups of students that meet together with common academic purposes and goals. Types of learning communities include paired courses with concurrent student enrollment, living-learning communities, and faculty learning communities. This article discusses a learning community of 21 students that I created with a colleague in the English department. The community encompasses two general education courses: an algebra-based physics course entitled "Intro to Physics" and a literature course entitled "Science Fiction, Science Fact." Students must enroll in both of these courses during the same semester. Additionally, I highlight advantages to linking these courses through surveying the assignments and course materials that we used in our learning community. Figure 1 shows the topics that are covered in both physics and literature courses.

AB  - In an increasingly complex interconnected world, STEAM practices have gained attention in Higher Education (HE). The integration of Sciences, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics pedagogies with those from the Arts takes many forms with myriad intentions, processes and outcomes. Common aspirations pertain to equipping students with interdisciplinary skills required for the jobs market, increasing intellectual curiosity and collaboratively developing creative, socially equitable responses to complex global challenges. The Erasmus+ project "STEAM Innovation and Curriculum" involves seven European partners who have been pioneering STEAM approaches and methods. Using workshops, discussions, hacking processes and reflective practice, this collaborative work is the first comprehensive attempt to systematically analyse and showcase European approaches to STEAM in HE. Project outputs relate to the three project phases and include defining STEAM and a Handbook on STEAM approaches (Phase 1), the development of new STEAM methods (Phase 2) and developing evaluation frameworks (Phase 3). The Handbook collects and codifies HE STEAM approaches and provides a working definition highlighting key elements of STEAM projects and processes as well as guidance and inspiration for those looking to develop and introduce STEAM approaches in their institution. This paper focuses on Phase 1 outcomes and insights to help foster STEAM thinking and to tackle issues around joint STEM/Arts standards, and concerns in the HE arena such as modes of intellectual investigation, curriculum planning and the case for inter- and transdisciplinarity.

AB  - There are well documented concerns with the imposition of high stakes testing into the fabric of school education, and there is now an increasing focus on how such tests impact children's "well-being." This can be witnessed in reports in the popular news media, where discussion of these impacts frequently refer to "stress" and "anxiety." Yet, there is no work that is able to tell us about what is happening in the bodies of the teachers and children who are living this schooling in the day-to-day; whether this is best considered through the languages of "stress"; or what the implications--emotional, educational, embodied--of these experiences might be. This paper develops a transdisciplinary approach that brings social and biological accounts together in order to address the "more-than-social" of the emotionality of childhood and schooling. We seek out opportunities for transdisciplinary connectivity and for new ways of seeing and knowing about learning. We consider what these ways of seeing and knowing might offer to education.

AB  - Transfer of learning, the application of learning to different contexts over time, is important to all learning for development. As 21st century skills specifically aim to be "generic," there is an assumption that they can be transferred from context to context. We investigate the process of transfer in problem solving, with specific focus on mathematical problem solving tasks. Problem solving is highly valued in 21st century workplaces, where mathematical skills are also considered to be foundational in STEM and of paramount importance. This study examines the transfer of first semester mathematics learning to problem solving in second semester physics at university. We report on: (1) university students' (n = 10) "think-aloud" accounts of the process of transfer; and (2) students' (n = 10) and academics' (n = 8) perspectives on transfer processes and problem solving. Think-aloud accounts show students' recursive use of interpretation, integration, planning and execution thinking processes and highlight the meta-cognitive strategies used in transfer. Academics' and students' perspectives on transfer show disparities. Understanding these perspectives is important to current initiatives to integrate and optimise 21st century learning within universities. We argue that renewed attention on the concept of transfer is needed if the generic aims of 21st century skills are to be understood and promoted.

AB  - Background: As the number of computer science (CS) jobs become increasingly available in this country and computing skills become essential tools for managing all aspects of our personal lives, CS is quickly becoming an essential element of K-12 education and recently, there has been increased attention to bringing computer science to the elementary grades. However, with a schedule that emphasizes literacy and mathematics, and other subjects competing for instructional time, creating opportunities for CS in the elementary school day is challenging. This study aimed to address this problem by investigating the use of problem-based transdisciplinary modules (i.e., "Time4CS" modules) that combined English language arts (ELA), science, and social studies lessons with the Code.org "Fundamentals" CS education program. Results: indicated that teachers who taught Time4CS modules completed more CS lessons than teachers who did not teach the modules. Further, across all classrooms, completing a higher percentage of non-grade level assigned Code.org Fundamentals lessons (i.e., Code.org lessons above or below grade level that were available to teachers, but not required for their particular grade level) was positively associated with students' achievement outcomes on state ELA and mathematics tests. Additionally, higher amounts of interdisciplinary teaching practices were associated with higher student achievement, specifically students' state assessment ELA scores. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that transdisciplinary problem-based modules that integrate the teaching of CS with other subject areas are a feasible way to bring more CS opportunities to younger learners. Moreover, it showed that implementing such modules is linked to more positive student academic achievement outcomes. With attentive revision, the modules featured in this study may be useful tools for elementary schools. These findings have implications for researchers, school district administrators, and those individuals who are in-charge of public policy initiatives seeking ways to bring CS to all elementary school students. Specifically, they highlight that it is possible to make time in the elementary school day for CS, and that there are no negative consequences for core subjects (e.g., ELA and mathematics).

AB  - Biomedical science students need to learn to code. Graduates face a future where they will be better prepared for research higher degrees and the workforce if they can code. Embedding coding in a biomedical curriculum comes with challenges. First, biomedical science students often experience anxiety learning quantitative and computational thinking skills and second biomedical faculty often lack expertise required to teach coding. In this study, we describe a creative coding approach to building coding skills in students using the packages of Processing and Arduino. Biomedical science students were taught by an interdisciplinary faculty team from Medicine and Health, Science and Architecture, Design and Planning. We describe quantitative and qualitative responses of students to this approach. Cluster analysis revealed a diversity of student responses, with a large majority of students who supported creative coding in the curriculum, a smaller but vocal cluster, who did not support creative coding because either the exercises were not sufficiently challenging or were too challenging and believed coding should not be in a Biomedical Science curriculum. We describe how two creative coding platforms, Processing and Arduino, embedded and used to visualize human physiological data, and provide responses to students, including those minority of students, who are opposed to coding in the curriculum This study found a variety of students responses in a final year capstone course of an undergraduate Biomedical Science degree where future pathways for students are either in research higher degrees or to the workforce with a future which will be increasingly data driven.

AB  - Some crises, such as those brought on or exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, are wicked problems--large, complex problems with no immediate answer. As such, they make rich centerpieces for learning with respect to public deliberation and issue-based dialogue. This essay reflects on an experimental, transdisciplinary health and science communication course entitled Comprehending COVID-19." The course represents a collaborative effort among 14 faculty representing 10 different academic departments to create a resource for teaching students how to deliberate the pandemic, despite its attending, oversaturated, fake-news-infused, infodemic. We offer transdisciplinary deliberation as a pedagogical framework to expand communication repertoires in ways useful for sifting through the messiness of an infodemic while also developing key deliberation skills for productively engaging participatory decision-making with concern to wicked problems.

AB  - Modern social problems are complex, multifaceted, and challenging to solve. Scholars are increasinglyapplying the concept of social innovation as a path to addressing social issues. Social innovation is aninterdisciplinary framework for producing social change that requires creativity, problem-solvingskills, and collaboration across systems. Higher education is progressively understanding the need toprovide interdisciplinary educational opportunities for students; however, little is known about theeffectiveness and impact of providing interdisciplinary learning experiences grounded in a socialinnovation framework. This article describes and analyzes an interdisciplinary summer fellowshipprogram focused on social innovation for graduate students in social work, business, and thehumanities and social sciences. The program employed multiple pedagogical approaches, includingclassroom-based instruction, field learning, and interdisciplinary teamwork. We used qualitative andquantitative pre- and post-evaluation student feedback to examine students' learning and overallexperiences. We found that the fellowship was a dynamic learning experience, through which studentsstrengthened their communication skills and translated academic concepts into practical ideas. The experience also impacted the students' career trajectories, influencing students to pursue careers thatinvolved working toward social progress in a variety of ways.

AB  - International research is already booming, and global problems like climate change have sparked interdisciplinary initiatives involving academics from many nations, disciplines, and tongues. Integrating the research team, the supervisors, and the doctoral students present several challenges, such as multicultural issues; integrating a good team depends on the supervision style and type of postgraduate students and how to supervise students to conduct quality research. This article examines supervisory approaches, and the challenges and rewards supervisors face while supervising diverse projects. The lectures from the Graduate Studies in Supervision course were examined, along with a literature study. Two senior supervisors from the International Business School (JIBS) and the School of Engineering at J√∂nk√∂ping University participated in small-scale research and observed two supervisory sessions, where were discussions and supervisor reflections. Observations, talks, and the findings of a survey based on Lee's research were compared to determine the supervisory style. The failure to define the scope and writing of the publication when a journal article is rejected after 1-2 years, which affects the trust of the student and the supervisor and the time plan in a multidisciplinary project, are just a few of the challenges that emerged during postgraduate supervision. Discovering our teaching and supervision style may help guide our students in a multidisciplinary environment. [For the full proceedings, see ED652228.]

AB  - This project produced an online astronomy course based on the free, online OpenStax textbook. When this project was conceived, about a year before the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors had no idea that in a short period of time, most college and university classes would be online. This abrupt change in modalities of courses, from traditional, face-to-face lectures and laboratories to a more modern online format, sparked energetic discussions about the effectiveness of online courses. This paper describes the online astronomy course and its creation and evaluates the success of the course at conveying the concepts and theories studied in astronomy courses. The success of this course is examined using a 100-question pre-test and post-test based on content knowledge. A survey was also completed of the students to evaluate the perceived success of the online course and the acceptance of online courses. The survey was adjusted to include opinions about the in-person labs that were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - In 2009, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) called for more interdisciplinary and community-engaged approaches to teaching and learning in the agricultural and life sciences to better respond to the food system challenges of the 21st century. As a result, institutions from across the nation have responded with a number of experiential learning and service-learning frameworks and practices aimed to enhance the academic experience for both student and community stakeholders. Sustainable agriculture education, with its explicit focus on experiential learning, interdisciplinarity, and values-based programming, has emerged as a promising approach to strengthen the fabric of agriculture and life sciences education. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the complex role of service learning as a central approach to undergraduate teaching and learning where interdisciplinary teaching, experiential learning, and community engagement are core goals. Specifically, we conducted a single embedded case study of a sustainable agriculture education program at a land grant university to explore how this triad was organized and possible service learning outcomes. Our case study was informed by semi-structured interviews of faculty and community partner stakeholders, participant observations of faculty and students, and secondary data analysis of course syllabi and other programmatic artifacts. Despite different understandings and practices of service learning by faculty within this, we found a common core of best practices. We conclude with criteria and best practices to guide teaching and learning from this triad perspective.

AB  - Against a backdrop of advocacy for interdisciplinary STEM curricula, this paper explores the design principles underpinning a three-year longitudinal research project that develops and evaluates interdisciplinary mathematics and science learning sequences involving multiple teachers and student cohorts across the primary school years. The research uses design-based methodology and deploys a pedagogical cycle based on representation construction and model-based reasoning, reflecting core disciplinary processes, and aimed at foundational concepts. The interdisciplinary structure of sequences in different topics, teacher pedagogy, and student reasoning and learning are illustrated through analysis of three learning sequence vignettes. In these topics both mathematical learning (measure, data modelling and spatial reasoning) and science learning (concepts and practices), were reinforced and enriched through the interdisciplinary framing. Drawing on notes of teacher planning and review meetings, coupled with classroom data, we identify (a) the conceptual and curricular design features through which mathematics and science can synergistically interweave, (b) the epistemological design challenges involved in working with teachers to achieve this interdisciplinary alignment, and (c) the key pedagogical design features that emerged to support this integration. The research contributes to conceptualising how interdisciplinary processes that enable synergistic interweaving of mathematics and science content and processes can be effectively framed and enacted.

AB  - Previous research of inquiry-based learning in natural science education indicates that there are different methodological trends and paradigms in the study of these issues. The aim of this research has been to analyze the selected relevant studies on inquiry-based learning in natural science education in order to assess their scope and limitations in the light of educational changes and reform initiatives. Directions of analysis of the relevant studies include considerations of the following: 1) Theoretical starting points and specific conceptual solutions, 2) Methodological design (research questions / problems, methods, techniques, and procedures), as well as 3) (Re)interpretation of the most significant findings. It could be stated that studies on inquiry-based learning in the field of natural sciences are rather insufficient, very diverse and heterogeneous, differing from each other both in terms of theory and conceptual solutions, research problems, methodological design, and implications for educational work. Even though experiments are very common in natural sciences, it has been found that triangulation is often used as a combination of qualitative and quantitative paradigms. The common thread that connects the selected studies in this field is the recognition of importance of inquiry-based learning as a very promising model of active teaching the natural sciences. It could be concluded that such studies require an interdisciplinary approach to the subject of study, both in empirical and theoretical field, providing better understanding of the future research directions of this phenomenon.

AB  - Today's college-aged students are graduating into a world that relies on multidisciplinary talents to succeed. Engineering college majors are more likely to find jobs after college that are outside of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, including jobs in healthcare, management, and social services. A survey of engineering undergraduate students at the University of Colorado Boulder in November 2012 indicated a desire by students to simultaneously pursue secondary teacher licensure alongside their engineering degrees: 25 percent "agreed" or "strongly agreed" that they would be interested in earning grades 7-12 science or math teaching licenses while [they] earn [their] engineering degrees. As colleges of engineering education, how can we support the success of our students in these multidisciplinary fields post-graduation, including teaching? The University of Colorado Boulder's College of Engineering and Applied Science in partnership with the School of Education, has developed an innovative program that results in graduates attaining a secondary school STEM teacher license concurrently with an engineering BS degree. This streamlined pathway through engineering educates and prepares a workforce of secondary teachers capable of high-level teaching in multiple STEM subjects--either engineering coupled with science (biology, chemistry, and physics), or engineering coupled with mathematics. These engineers are motivated and inspired to pursue two career routes because they find value and passion for both professions. One study showed that successful mathematics and science teachers "would have liked to be engineers." Teachers expressed that being comfortable and understanding engineering phenomena is a barrier to why they initially did not pursue an engineering career. We are fostering students that develop both an engineering mindset alongside a commitment to giving back through secondary teaching in this program. This research aims to discover if and how students in the engineering + teaching program identify themselves as both an engineering student and as a teaching student. We are exploring why students decided to pursue engineering and teaching and how they plan to use engineering, teaching, or both in their futures. It is important to also understand how we attract students to this program. Given the diverse student experience inherent in this degree program built around passion and desire to combine engineering and teaching, the paper addresses the questions, "How do engineering knowledge and teaching knowledge intersect for undergraduate engineering students?" and "What challenges exist to navigating an engineering major with a teaching license pathway?" Initial survey and focus group data collected this past academic year indicates that students in this degree program identify as both an engineer and a teacher. Using mixed-methods analysis informed by current education research--including quantitative and qualitative survey questions and small focus groups--we explore the ways in which students discovered this program and how they plan to incorporate the two disciplines in their future. We are interested in how engineering students will incorporate the knowledge that they learned in engineering classes into the lesson plans they design for secondary classroom students.

AB  - Disciplines play a major role in agricultural education and extension. Biology, chemistry and physics are all essential to understand nature and to improve the quality of agricultural production. During the past centuries, disciplines have evolved, and a multitude of specialisations emerged, like cell biology, colloid chemistry and geophysics. The development of specialisations went so far that one can speak of overspecialisation in areas, the problem of which is that there is too little communication and cooperation between subspecialisations. It is surprising that the pedagogy of interdisciplinary education is underdeveloped. Given the importance of interdisciplinary education, it is absolutely necessary to develop an interdisciplinary field of Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK). This can best be taught to future teachers by introducing them to different fields that are included in solving practical problems, or trying to attain certain goals. In a situation in which there are no, or hardly any, guidelines for implementing interdisciplinary education beyond the generic recommendations of educational research, how can educators make progress with the creation of a PCK for interdisciplinary education? To answer this question, this article describes six characteristics of interdisciplinary thinking that can serve as a foundation of a taxonomy of educational objects in the field of interdisciplinary education. It also presents principles that can be used in the implementation of interdisciplinary education.

AB  - Project-based learning units are often used for large scale work integrated learning (WIL) experiences in Liberal Studies Degrees as they offer scalability and sustainability of delivery to large cohorts. This systematic search and review evaluates the effectiveness of interdisciplinary project-based learning in Science Degree programs for developing discipline knowledge and employability skills. Education literature databases were searched for peerreviewed journal articles that discussed undergraduate science-based degree programs with project-based learning units involving students from multiple disciplines. Data were analysed for evidence of a skill gain in 6 areas (Discipline knowledge, Communication, Teamwork, Interdisciplinary effectiveness, Critical thinking and problem solving, and Self-management). Projects were assigned to categories based on interdisciplinary breadth and depth. Data was analysed by cross-tabulations, Fisher's Exact test and by calculating odds ratios (OR), which indicate the effect size. Perception of a skill gain was significantly more likely to be reported than an objectively measured skill gain (p<0.001). Real discipline skill gains were 6.6 times more likely in projects narrow in discipline mix (OR 6.6), however perceived discipline skill gains were high irrespective of project type. Projects with wide interdisciplinarity were significantly associated with perceived gains in interdisciplinary effectiveness (OR 32, p<0.05) and more likely to have perceived gains in communication (OR 2.5) and teamwork (OR 3.4) skills. When projects have greater interdisciplinary breadth or depth, perceived student employability skill gains increase, perceived discipline skill gains are unaffected, however actual discipline skill gains are less reported. Further research and evidence that project-based learning is meeting the desired WIL learning objectives of the curriculum is needed.

AB  - Recent studies in applied linguistics research have focused on how teachers draw on 'outside' knowledge relating to students' everyday life for the purpose of teaching subject matter content. This study focuses on such practices in the context of English-medium instruction (EMI) higher education in an online undergraduate chemistry module. Adopting an interdisciplinary perspective, the study combines multimodal Conversation Analysis (CA) and the Autonomy dimension of Legitimation Code Theory (LCT) to examine how one lecturer shifts between 'inside' knowledge of chemistry and 'outside' knowledge for a range of different purposes. Multimodal CA is used to carry out micro-analyses of epistemics and identity-related positioning in interaction, while LCT 'autonomy codes' are used to trace knowledge-building trajectories in which knowledge is positioned inside or outside the target topic and is used for different purposes. The analyses highlight how the lecturer skilfully deployed a range of semiotic resources in transitioning between 'inside' and 'outside' knowledge, and how these resources were leveraged for the building of disciplinary knowledge. Implications of this interdisciplinary approach for research and practice in university EMI contexts are discussed.

AB  - Despite psychology's position within the National Council for the Social Studies' definition of social studies, the American Psychological Association is advocating the rebranding of psychology as a science course. This study interviews six high school psychology teachers and employs a Foucauldian framework to understand different perspectives on this rebranding, what makes teachers position their psychology course as science or social studies, and how that rebranding has impacted teachers' perceived ability to make psychology content relevant to students' lived experiences. We find significant disagreement among psychology teachers about the degree to which they should embrace the "psychology-as-science" paradigm. We also find that most professional development for high school psychology teachers is rooted in the science paradigm and that many teachers feel limited by their ability to connect psychology content to students' lived experiences under the science paradigm. We conclude with recommendations for teachers, curriculum leaders, researchers, and teacher preparation programs for upholding psychology as an interdisciplinary social studies course.

AB  - What should science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM) education look like? In the context of educational policy, the STEAM conversation has intensified and spread across the United States and some other counties (Eger, 2015; Yakman & Lee, 2012). This article advocates an arts-integrated approach to STEAM education and discusses the potential of this approach for opening up a transdisciplinary space. This space will therefore be capable of fostering an "innovated" society. Here, the author suggests that teachers can create a transdisciplinary space in their own STEAM lessons by designing assignments that engage with multiple disciplines and thereby nourish students' ability in transferring learning in multiple disciplines.

AB  - A desired outcome of education reform efforts is for undergraduates to effectively integrate knowledge across disciplines in order to evaluate and address real-world issues. Yet there are few assessments designed to measure if and how students think interdisciplinarily. Here, a sample of science faculty were surveyed to understand how they currently assess students' interdisciplinary science understanding. Results indicate that individual writing-intensive activities are the most frequently used assessment type (69%). To understand how writing assignments can accurately assess students' ability to think interdisciplinarily, we used a preexisting rubric, designed to measure social science students' interdisciplinary understanding, to assess writing assignments from 71 undergraduate science students. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 25 of those students to explore similarities and differences between assignment scores and verbal understanding of interdisciplinary science. Results suggest that certain constructs of the instrument did not fully capture this competency for our population, but instead, an interdisciplinary framework may be a better model to guide assessment development of interdisciplinary science. These data suggest that a new instrument designed through the lens of this model could more accurately characterize interdisciplinary science understanding for undergraduate students.

AB  - In order to fully appreciate the interdisciplinary nature of energy resources, there is a need to understand pertinent issues from other viewpoints besides a purely chemistry perspective. In this paper, the teaching of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and business databases as part of CM4282: Energy Resources at the Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore (NUS), is described. For teaching of CBA, in two 1h sessions, topics such as net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), discount rate, payback period, and sensitivity analysis were introduced in the context of capital budgeting. With collaboration from NUS libraries, in another 1h session, students were instructed on searching business databases for conducting strength, weakness, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis as part of their end-of-semester group presentation. Exposure to CBA and business databases enables chemistry majors in CM4282 to understand energy resources in an interdisciplinary light and enables the application of classroom knowledge to real-life scenarios in energy resources.

AB  - The first step to access information; it is possible to perceive it by hearing, seeing and touching. It is necessary to make sense of this gained knowledge. Therefore, having some basic skills forms the basis of all disciplines. The purpose of this research is to determine skills through activities prepared with an interdisciplinary approach. The research was designed as a case study. Purposeful sampling method was used to determine the study group of the research; the study was conducted with third grade primary school teaching students as the study group. As data collection tools in the study; skill target list, in-class skill observation form, semi-structured interview form and student products were used. At the end of the research, the students' skills were determined and in terms of science skills; it was revealed that life skills and innovative thinking skills were sufficient, but scientific process skills were not sufficient. In terms of language skills, reading and writing skills were found to be at an intermediate level. However, speaking skills, which are self-expression skills, were found to be at a low level. In terms of mathematical skills, it was observed that their problem solving skills were high, but their level of using basic mathematical skills was low. Technology skills; it has been found that it is sufficient in terms of algorithm creation, but not in the context of science acquisition. In addition, it has been observed that the activities prepared through the task-oriented teaching method make the lesson interesting and are effective in revealing creativity.

AB  - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education has been identified as a keystone teaching and learning area for developing students' knowledge and skills on interdisciplinary critical thinking and problem solving (We use the term 'interdisciplinary' because discipline knowledge and methods were integrated from different disciplines in the project that used a synthesis of approaches). The position held by various government, industry and education stakeholders is that STEM learning, through different stages of education, will enable students to achieve their full potential. Underpinning this research was a response to an expressed school community need articulated through a primary school Principal's desire to integrate STEM learning into the classroom. Consequently, three primary schools from the mid north coast and north coast regions, New South Wales (NSW), Australia were involved in this research. In particular, the project facilitated teacher professional learning through authentic teaching and learning experiences coupled with transferable teaching and assessment strategies for the classroom. The rural and remote settings of the schools was influential in the design of the program. The methodology drew on Technacy Genre Theory to frame the interdisciplinary learning domains: Science (hypothesis testing literacies); Technology (digital microscope and robotics literacies); Engineering (food systems and biotechnology literacies) and Mathematics (data collection and statistics literacies). The findings indicated the teachers benefited through the development of effective strategies that led to successful outcomes on interdisciplinary teaching and learning and built up their confidence, knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of a STEM program into their primary school classrooms.

AB  - Interdisciplinary introduction to quantum information science (QIS) courses are proliferating at universities across the US, but the experiences of instructors in these courses have remained largely unexplored in the discipline-based education research (DBER) communities. Here, we address this gap by reporting on the findings of a survey of instructors teaching introduction to QIS courses at institutions across the U.S., primarily at the undergraduate or hybrid undergraduate and graduate level, as well as follow-up focus interviews with six individual instructors. Key themes from this analysis include challenges and opportunities associated with the diversity of instructor and student backgrounds, student difficulties with the mathematical formalism (especially though not exclusively with linear algebra), and the need for better textbooks and curricular materials. We also find that while course topics are ostensibly similar, each course is crafted by its instructor to tell a different story about QIS and to uniquely balance goals such as accessibility and academic rigor, such that no canonical introduction to QIS course emerges from our dataset. We discuss the implications of this finding with regard to the benefits and risks associated with standardization of curricula as QIS coursework matures.

AB  - Innovation and entrepreneurship education develop rapidly in China, but the teaching varies considerably in quality. Therefore, it is very important to systematically construct an evaluation index system of innovation and entrepreneurship education. The specialty setting of comprehensive universities has the characteristics of interdisciplinary. The research selected the Shenzhen Campus of Jinan University as a case study. Based on literature research, the research constructed an evaluation index system of innovation and entrepreneurship education for undergraduate students majoring in interdisciplinary arts and sciences, which is composed of 4 primary indexes and 19 secondary indexes. In total, 234 respondents were surveyed and Importance-performance Analysis modelling was performed to analyze the innovation and entrepreneurship education situation of the research object. Results show that the most important evaluation index to be improved is the innovative service platform. The findings of this study would be of use to the development of innovation and entrepreneurship education in other similar universities.

AB  - We here propose a simple and fast hands-on activity requiring limited equipment, to introduce students of various levels (bachelor's or high school) and backgrounds (from science to arts) to the chemistry of color. The different colors of stained glass are replicated through the deposition, on ordinary glass slides, of silica coatings colored by addition of metal ions and nanoparticles. A silica sol is used as a matrix to embed metal ions, followed by an "in situ" reduction activated by thermal treatment on a hot plate. The formation of metal nanoparticles by this procedure induces plasmonic colors in the glass coating, thus "mimicking" the ancient procedure of stained-glass fabrication through a simple and quick method. Characterization of the colored glass by optical spectroscopy is also presented. This easily reproducible activity demonstrates basic concepts of redox reactions, chemistry of color, and plasmonic nanoparticles. Thanks to its interdisciplinary character and immediate and tangible results, this activity is well-suited for teaching laboratories for bachelor's and high school students as well as for public engagement activities.

AB  - Images are central to our understanding of and learning about our world. We argue that visual training needs to be improved in the higher education system to enhance the potential of visual thinking to mediate productively our relationship with the context we inhabit. Initiatives from the social sciences and humanities since the end of the twenty century have highlighted the importance of training in visual research methods and visual literacy, but they also expose the scarcity of tools for understanding and applying images in research processes. In this paper, we examine the way visual methods were organised and employed in earlier studies and propose a new taxonomy. This classification will map these methods in an interdisciplinary framework that allows practitioners to use images in the development of projects. This proposal also seeks to inform future methodological approaches where images are recognised as a language of knowledge, analogous to numbers or linguistic expressions.

AB  - We designed an interdisciplinary project-based learning course in hydroponics for undergraduate non-science major students. Students worked in teams to design, build, and maintain plants in various types of hydroponic systems over the semester. In three semesters of teaching the course, students consistently demonstrated knowledge of course material and became confident in growing plants by hydroponic methods. Students reported the project-based, team-based, and mini-lecture aspects of the course increased their learning and motivation in the course.

AB  - Teachers have the daunting task of preparing students for a future that they cannot predict. In an age of information where students have the world quite literally at their fingertips, and with the ever-growing momentum of integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), it is not enough that students experience STEM subjects exclusively in silos. Instead, they need to provide students with integrated opportunities for learning, which can be beneficial to student achievement (Becker and Park 2011). To be well positioned for the future, students must be able to work productively in environments that transcend disciplinary boundaries to generate novel solutions to improve our world. In this article, the authors share an afterschool STEM inquiry that transformed 22 third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade students by positioning them as engineers solving an authentic problem. While there are several different ways in which to integrate disciplines such as multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary (Choi and Pak 2006), the problem under investigation models a transdisciplinary approach, defined as integration that uses the collective expertise from many disciplines to solve problems in a manner that focuses on the inquiry (as described by Choi and Pak 2006). In a transdisciplinary inquiry, students become so enthralled in the problem that they use previous knowledge and acquire new knowledge from multiple disciplines to provide a solution (Bush et al. 2018). In this inquiry, third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade students modeled, designed, and tested robotic prototypes as solutions to getting a student in a wheelchair from the first floor to the third floor of a school building.

AB  - Background and purpose: The purpose of this exploratory case study is to describe how scholars negotiated disciplinary divides to develop and communicate to their students an understanding of the basic features of scientific knowledge. Our goals were to examine boundary crossing in interdisciplinary collaboration and to assess the efficacy of adding science content to an introductory Women's Studies course. Sample: We studied a collaboration between faculty in Biology and Women's Studies and evaluated science modules in a Women's Studies course at a regional four-year university in the Midwestern USA. The study included 186 student participants over three semesters and four faculty from Philosophy, Women's Studies and Biology. Design and method: Women's Studies and Biology faculty collaborated to design and implement science content learning modules that included the case of women and science in an introductory Women's Studies course. Qualitative data collected from faculty participants in the form of peer debrief sessions and narrative reflections were used to examine the process of interdisciplinary collaboration. Students exposed to curriculum changes were administered pre- and post-lesson surveys to evaluate their understanding of issues faced by women in science careers, the nature of science, and interest in science studies. Data from collaborators, student journal reflections, and pre-/post-lesson surveys were considered together in an evaluation of how knowledge of science was understood and taught in a Women's Studies course over a longitudinal study of three semesters. Results: We found evidence of discipline-based challenges to interdisciplinarity and disciplinary boundary crossing among collaborators. Three themes emerged from our collaboration: challenges posed by disciplinary differences, creation of a space for interdisciplinary work, and evidence of boundary crossing. Student participants exhibited more prior knowledge of Women's Studies content than nature of science but showed learning in the areas of scientific literacy and the understanding of issues related to women in science careers. Student understanding of science content was enhanced by the participation of a woman scientist in the learning module. Conclusion: This case study illustrates how creating an inclusive space for interdisciplinary collaboration led to successful curriculum transformation and academic boundary crossing by faculty participants. Success is evident in the legacy of interdisciplinarity in the curriculum and learning gains by students. Use of a feminist science studies framework was successful at helping students learn about the influence of values on science and the tentative nature of scientific conclusions. It was less successful in teaching the distinction between science and other ways of knowing and the conception that science is an evidence-based approach to understanding the natural world. This study highlights the importance of interdisciplinary teams of faculty members collaborating to help students learn about science by modeling that there are multiple ways of knowing.

AB  - This article describes how the EduPARK Research and Development Project promotes articulation between research, teachers, professional practice, and initial and advanced teacher training, constituting a very useful theoretical and practical framework, with impact not only in schools, but also in the community and in the tourism sector. The EduPARK app was developed by the EduPARK project multidisciplinary team, involving researchers from the University of Aveiro (Portugal) from three specialisms: education, biology, and computer science. The project aimed to create attractive and effective strategies for interdisciplinary learning, relying on the development of an interactive mobile augmented reality (AR) app that supports geocaching activities to be explored in the Aveiro urban park.

AB  - What is the science of reading? The Reading League, in their document "Science of Reading: Defining Guide" (TRL, 2022), proposes that "The science of reading is a vast, interdisciplinary body of scientifically-based* research about reading and issues related to reading and writing." (p. 11.) The asterisk is carrying a lot of weight here. What does it mean for something to be scientifically based? It means that the evidence for a claim is weighed by the design and methods used to collect and analyze it, and the claim takes into account the limitations of that evidence. In this paper we will discuss some of the designs and methods used to investigate how children learn to read for understanding and provide a brief history into the use of these designs in reading and educational research. [This paper was published in "The Reading League Journal" Jan-Feb 2023.]

AB  - This article takes up the argument from an earlier article and seeks to detail the importance and role of the history and philosophy of science (HPS), conceived as a unitary interdisciplinary field, in science education. However, on this count, it not only seeks to ground the salience for science education at the school level but also its role in higher education. While elaborating upon its importance in school education, it charts out additional areas where the HPS could enrich the already existing objectives envisaged. Furthermore, the article highlights the importance of HPS both at the level of the pedagogy of undergraduate education as well as research mentorship at the graduate level. While, for analytic purposes, these two spheres are addressed separately, the article argues for the need to forge linkages between them.

AB  - The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), a reform effort "for states, by states," advances ambitious ideals for elementary science teaching, but the fate of these ideals will depend in part on the engagement of state science coordinators (SSCs). This article explores the responses of SSCs to NGSS in a purposeful sample of 18 US states. Based on analysis of 19 interviews with 22 SSCs, we develop two arguments. First, SSCs' ideas about improving elementary science education converged around three themes: the introduction of three-dimensional science teaching and learning, the integration of engineering with science teaching, and the integration of science with ELA and mathematics. Second, SSCs' sense-making about reforming elementary science education was situated in and shaped by (a) their knowledge of how elementary science instruction has been and continues to be de-prioritized, as well as their experiences (b) facilitating work groups in developing science standards using the Framework for K-12 Science Education, and (c) participating in professional networks.

AB  - At the basic education level, content related to disasters is included in the scope of courses such as Life Sciences, Science, and Social Studies. Studies reveal that teachers and pre-service teachers who conduct these courses are not equipped with the necessary technological and pedagogical skills. It is predicted that integrating disasters and disaster education, which have an interdisciplinary structure, with Web 2.0 technologies, one of today's digital learning tools, will make significant contributions to making disaster education effective. In this framework, the study aimed to design a "Digital Disaster Education Program" in an online learning environment for pre-service primary school, science and social sciences teachers. The study consists of three main parts: designing, implementing, and evaluating the Digital Disaster Education Program. Taba (Grassroots Rationale) model was used in the design of the program. The program, which had a five-day implementation period in the online environment, was repeated three times on different dates and with different participants within a year. In each implementation, 24 pre-service social studies, 24 pre-service science, and 24 pre-service primary school teachers (72 pre-service teachers in total) from across Turkey participated voluntarily. The digital disaster education materials developed by the participants during the program were evaluated with an analytical rubric. As a result, an example of Web 2.0 supported online disaster education programme based on Taba Model has emerged. After the evaluation process, some of the participant products were entitled to receive support by being projected toThe Scientific and Technological Research Council of T√ºrkiye (T√úBITAK), which is one of the reflections of the positive results of the process. At the end of the study, suggestions were presented for the acquisition of disaster education and digital teaching skills in the pre-service process.

AB  - Public health education is a powerful tool for improving communicable disease awareness and prevention protocols. Despite the fact that health education is crucial for the advancement of COVID-19 awareness and vaccination decisions, how a teacher approaches students to learn about health education during COVID-19 vaccination is a challenging issue. This study aimed to assess the preferences for public¬†health education during COVID-19 vaccination intervention and compare the predictors of preferences between science and non-science university students in Bangladesh. A multi-item questionnaire was developed and an online link was conveniently sent to the encounters between 31st May, 2023 and 15th August, 2023. Binary logistic regression analysis was applied to rationalize the research objective. The pooled preference for public health education was 71.3% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 67.7-74.3) vs. 81.5% (95% CI 79.3-84.7) between science and non-science students. Out of twelve predictors "vaccine agreement", "bio-safety behavior", and "disease awareness" were significantly associated (p < 0.01, p < 0.05) with the preference for public health education in both groups. Varied effects were also observed for some predictors: vaccine "safety" and "side effects" were significant (p < 0.05, p < 0.01) in science and non-science students, respectively. To address the conflict in decisions, non-science students significantly preferred "prevention alliance" whereas science students preferred "environmental health" issues (p < 0.05).Public health education was more preferred by non-science university students than by¬†science students¬†in making¬†COVID-19 vaccine¬†decisions. The focus of transformative public¬†health education should be interdisciplinary, including information on communicable diseases, public health measures, and prevention alliances, as well as information about vaccines' side effects and safety.

AB  - This article examines how scientists, classroom teachers, poetry educators, and youth negotiated the domains of science through their engagement in a two-year Massive Open Online Collaboration (MOOC) funded by the National Science Foundation. To make sense of learners' unconventional and interdisciplinary writing and the cultural and disciplinary conflicts that emerged around it, I offer a reframing of science literacy as a series of crash encounters. Such a reframing prompts literacy practitioners to anticipate fallout when diverse bodies, objects, and rhetorics collide and, therefore, to better design and participate in interdisciplinary networks to create more dynamic and vibrant approaches to science literacy.

AB  - This special issue introduces recent research on mathematics in interdisciplinary STEM education. STEM education is widely promoted by governments around the world as a way of boosting students' interest and achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and preparing STEM-qualified workers for twenty-first century careers. However, the role of mathematics in STEM education often appears to be marginal, and we do not understand well enough how mathematics contributes to STEM-based problem-solving or how STEM education experiences enhance students' learning of mathematics. In this survey paper, we present a narrative review of empirical and conceptual research literature, published between 2017 and 2022. These literature sources are organised by a framework comprising five thematic clusters: (1) interdisciplinary curriculum models and approaches; (2) student outcomes and experiences; (3) teacher preparation and professional development; (4) classroom implementation and task design; and (5) policy, structures, and leadership. We use the framework to provide an overview of the papers in this issue and to propose directions for future research. These include: investigating methods and rationales for connecting the constituent STEM disciplines so as to preserve the disciplinary integrity of mathematics; clarifying what is meant by student "success" in interdisciplinary STEM programs, projects, and other educational approaches; moving beyond classroom practices that position mathematics as just a tool for solving problems in other disciplines; understanding what makes a STEM task mathematically rich; and asking how STEM education research can productively shape STEM education policy.

AB  - Theories of learning developed in education and psychology for the past 100 years are woefully inadequate to support the design of schools and classrooms that foster deep learning and equity. Needed is learning theory that can guide us in creating schools and classrooms where deep learning occurs, where learners' full selves are engaged, and that disrupt existing patterns of inequality and oppression. In this article, we build on recent research in education, neuroscience, psychology, and anthropology to articulate a theory of learning that has the potential to move us toward that goal. We elaborate four key principles of learning: (1) learning is rooted in evolutionary, biological, and neurological systems; (2) learning is integrated with other developmental processes whereby the whole child (emotion, identity, cognition) must be taken into account; (3) learning is shaped in culturally organized practice across people's lives; and (4) learning is experienced as embodied and coordinated through social interaction. Taken together, these principles help us understand learning in a way that foregrounds the range of community and cultural experiences people have throughout the life course and across the multiple settings of life and accounts for learning as set within systems of injustice.

AB  - Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is consistently seen as a top priority; however, STEM programs often suffer from low retention. Students who start in STEM degree programs often lose interest or face obstacles that cause them to leave. Here, we describe a non-traditional approach meant to encourage a range of students to pursue or continue their STEM education. Active learning approaches have long been touted to stimulate long-term interest and prepare students for a career in natural science. We provide a case study of an interdisciplinary, cohort-centric, mentor-guided summer research internship. By establishing an understanding of how science is currently conducted in agriculture, through several faculty mentors, the program allowed students to embrace their core interests while being able to fit into larger interdisciplinary narratives which provided motivation to continue their path in STEM education.

AB  - Sketchnoting is a design methodology that involves communicating concepts visually. This active learning tool has shown potential for influencing student learning but its applications have been limited. Adopting the principles of research related to the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning and employing Mayer's cognitive theory of multimedia learning, our interdisciplinary team from industrial design, biology, and education incorporated this pedagogical tool in an undergraduate upper-level ecology course and assessed its effectiveness. We found that students' perceptions of the value of using tools such as sketchnoting did not significantly change after being introduced to the tool, but over two-thirds of students found the tool valuable and would recommend it to other students. The percentages of students who used the tool never or seldom, remained similar over the semester, but a much higher percentage of students increased their use of sketchnoting. We found that there were differences in how students utilized sketchnoting for learning. Students reported the importance of using sketchnoting for communicating. Because drawings are critical ways to communicate science, teaching visual representation techniques such as sketchnoting can improve science students'ability to identify and solve problems; subsequently improving their long-term success. Additional research exploring why and how this approach could be integrated within college coursework and how it can support learning in science is needed. Framed as an example of SoTL work, our efforts also highlight the iterative nature of these projects and the importance for researchers and faculty members to embrace the multiple roles of teacher and learner.

AB  - What pedagogical strategies support students from a refugee background connecting to the natural world? What would these strategies look like for fifteen students participating in a language intensive New Arrivals Program (NAP)? These questions were the focus of a small collaborative project set up to investigate the impact of pedagogical initiatives on building educational and cultural connections, and enhancing educational achievement in science in refugee students. This article focuses on the events and outcomes of an interdisciplinary unit of work based around a newly established school garden. Science, mathematics, English and visual arts are the key learning areas covered. The study involves one gardener, a volunteer community artist and three science and mathematics teacher education academics.

AB  - An increasingly important aim in education is to develop students capable of addressing complex, interdependent problems. This study integrates theories of situated learning, authentic science research, socioscientific issues, and interdisciplinary STEM education to construct a program for high school students. Drawn from Vygotsky and Dewey's philosophy of social constructivism, we developed a framework to incorporate situated learning, authentic science research, and socioscientific issues in fostering sustainable development competencies of systems thinking and problem-solving to provide opportunities for students to transition from newcomers to adaptive experts. Using qualitative methods, we explored the development of a systems thinking approach in problem-solving related to climate change and air pollution in fifty-seven international school students in Taiwan. We found patterns of (1) systems thinking application in innovative solutions, (2) understanding the practices of authentic science research, and (3) interconnections between science and society. The findings suggest the framework has relevance to high-value learning of systems thinking and for discussions of problem-solving in community contexts and future research directions.

AB  - Game jams are intensive events focusing on creation. Their popularity and visibility have soared in recent years. The phenomenon has attracted the attention of scholars interested in education and learning, and the potential of game jams has been studied in various ways. Increasingly, game jams have come to be viewed as a site for learning. They are seen as activities for developing technical skills needed for digital game development, developing so-called soft skills such as collaboration and communication skills and as a way to teach and learn science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics (STEAM) skills. In this article, the educational aspects of game jams are explored from multidisciplinary points of view. Combining education science, design research, and game studies, the authors position game jamming at the intersection of these disciplines to explore its various learning dimensions. This positioning provides a starting point for future studies of game jamming in the context of learning and teaching and invites discussion from diverse fields of study.

AB  - College students with identities traditionally marginalized in scientific disciplines are more engaged and more likely to remain in science if they feel that they belong in their science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classes and departments. In this qualitative case study, we elevated marginalized student voices to learn how departmental experiences shaped their sense of belonging in curricular and co-curricular spaces. Our research team interviewed 27 undergraduate life science students at a large predominantly white, research-intensive university. Participants reflected on their lived experiences and feelings of belonging within a biology department and shared their perceptions of departmental efforts related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Three themes emerged as being of value to undergraduate students while they navigated the sciences: (1) implementing inclusive pedagogies, (2) providing co-curricular resources and support, and (3) humanizing life sciences education. These stories illuminated the importance of authenticity and intentionality in the implementation of strategies related to these three themes. This study provides an example of the power of centering marginalized students' lived experiences to identify strategies that can be employed more broadly to improve our courses, our departmental cultures, and our institutional policies--strategies essential to supporting students with a diversity of identities in engaging, belonging, and persisting in STEM.

AB  - This study addressed the intractable issue of ensuring that all students, including those who are linguistically and culturally diverse, have access to high quality science education. We explored the efforts of two organizations in the United States (one that supports science teachers and one that focuses on language development) to design resources that can inform science instruction for multilingual learners. We used Bronstein's (2003) framework for interdisciplinary collaboration to shed light on the institutional, program, and interpersonal factors that defined and helped sustain the collaboration between the two organizations. The findings showcase what it takes to integrate equity, science, and language development considerations in resources designed to inform content-area instruction for multilingual learners. The paper adds to the nascent literature on the role of interdisciplinary collaboration in supporting the science education of multilingual students and is unique in its exploration of both the process and the product of this collaboration.

AB  - Since the 1960s, many scholars have questioned the relationship between library science and information science. This paper investigates LIS doctoral dissertations in terms of their topics and interdisciplinarity in the period 1960-2013. Results show that LIS is an interdisciplinary field in which library science and information science are intimately related. The study shows that Information Science has surpassed Library Science to become the dominant research topic in LIS. It also shows that the academic background of doctoral advisors affects the interdisciplinarity of their student's doctoral dissertations.

AB  - The aim of this research is to explore the research trends of inquiry-based science (IBS) articles in the Web of Science database during 2000-2021. The bibliometric method was used in the research. A total of 662 IBS education articles were included in the study, out of 1389 IBS publications covering all fields published in Web of Science during 2000-2021. Citation and co-citation analysis were applied using VOSviewer software. The data obtained from this analysis are presented with tables, graphs, and bibliometric maps. According to the results, there is an increase in the number of IBS publications or citations in the recent years. The most cited keywords are teacher development, professional development, primary school, science achievement, and PISA. The most cited countries are the USA, Germany, and France. It has recently been determined that there is a trend towards sustainability education, local perspectives, technology, and interdisciplinary integration in IBS studies. The results were discussed with previous studies in the literature and some suggestions were made for future research. This research, which photographs inquired-based science studies published over the last two decades, may be useful to science education experts and curriculum evaluators.

AB  - How do cultural heritage scientists and art conservators identify pigments and other painting media in a decorated object or painting, preferably without taking samples that could potentially damage the artwork? A major emphasis in the characterization, authentication, and conservation of works of art and cultural heritage objects is the use of multifaceted, noninvasive analytical methods whenever and wherever possible. In recent years, the development of portable, hand-held, noninvasive spectrometers and the widespread availability of standard spectroscopic databases that allow for the comparison and identification of newly acquired spectra have assisted scientists and conservators in this endeavor. According to their Web site, the Cultural Heritage Science Open-Source (CHSOS) "is a private practice service specialized in on-site examination and documentation of works of art with technical photography and analytical techniques that also provides related training and consulting for private professionals and institutions. CHSOS clients are art collectors, museums, and private professionals, such as conservators, art historians, and art appraisers." Fortunately, for chemistry educators interested in the spectroscopic characterization and identification of pigments, CHSOS has provided freely available, readily downloadable spectroscopic data for 81 historical and 66 modern pigments using five spectroscopic methods capable of noninvasive analysis (diffuse UV-vis-NIR reflectance, X-ray fluorescence, Raman, near-infrared, and Fourier transform infrared). This article describes the construction and features of three Vernier Software Logger "Pro" databases that incorporate the CHSOS spectroscopic data from historical pigments and presents four classroom activities that allow students to utilize the databases to develop and apply their knowledge of spectroscopy to identify pigments.

AB  - Several traditional chemistry lab experiences were replaced with a problem-based learning (PBL) experience in a university general education, conceptual chemistry course. Students worked in small groups on an authentic chemistry problem in which each student played a different role (Scientist, Engineering, Marketing Manager, Safety Officer, or Secretary). Mid-semester, the pandemic forced the course online. Q methodology [Q] was used to determine the divergent viewpoints that existed amongst the students regarding their PBL experience. Each student provided their view by sorting related statements into a grid. Three divergent viewpoints emerged from the analyses: two viewpoints were positive about the PBL experience (Motivated learners and Committed to my group) and one was negative (Negative experience due to group dynamics). Descriptions of these views and implications are discussed.

AB  - The article investigates sustainable development from the holistic perspective, taking into account the complex nature of the world and the dynamism of the socio-economic systems. The study is interdisciplinary, as it addresses the issues of economics, mathematics and physics with the main focus on the modern perspective of sustainable development offered in the field of education. The article focuses on key questions concerning the expansion of the educational processes and deepening of ideas and knowledge about the dynamism and diversity of the planetary system. The holistic approach implies the interaction of various nonlinear features that have been used in the paper to build a mental model and a causal relationship schema. The understanding of the interaction of energy flows in socio-economic systems has been used by the authors to explain the underlying connection of various processes. The authors of the article propose a systemic dynamic model of sustainability, which can open up an understanding of some of the reasons for changes in the potential of the industrial sector. Modeling results have been obtained and interpreted using historical USA statistical data from 1949 to 2019. In the article, the authors reveal the relationship between nature, society and human from the point of view of promising and methodological approaches of the "new" and "old" world. The diversity of experiences makes it possible to question the dominant approaches of traditional teaching in education. This creates the need to look for new foundations that can promote the development of more sustainable learning for the future.

AB  - Elementary teachers are tasked with the challenge of implementing Next Generation Science Standards-aligned projects that integrate science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science (STEM + CS) in a variety of classroom contexts. This study investigates how teachers verbally support students in two classrooms, one general education class and one inclusive class with a larger proportion of students with individualized educational plans, to engage in a Next Generation Science Standards-aligned,¬†STEM + CS¬†unit. Teachers' verbal support for students to understand how (pragmatic) and when and why (epistemic) to use practices was examined during whole-class discussions for a 4-week unit in science, engineering, and computer science-focused lessons. Bi-weekly teacher surveys and weekly teacher interviews provided insight into the teachers' perceptions of students and project activities in each class section. Teachers reported instructional decisions to modify their enactment of the interdisciplinary curricular materials for the Inclusive Class and discussed their rationales for these modifications. Results suggest that instructional decisions that teachers made in how to verbally support students may depend upon their own knowledge of the different disciplines being integrated, their prior beliefs of students in different classroom contexts, and their in-the-moment perceptions of student needs. These factors may have led to different learning experiences for the students in each class section. Findings underscore the need for more research to better understand what kinds of support students and teachers need to be able to integrate engineering, science, and computer science content and practices within their elementary classrooms and provide equitable learning opportunities for all students.

AB  - Professional training plans play a pivotal role in higher education institutions, as they significantly impact employability, graduate performance, and meeting labour market demands. These aspects serve as crucial indicators in the selection processes for prospective candidates in higher education institutions and in accrediting the quality of both degree programmes and the institutions themselves. This study examines the perceptions of Marine Biology graduates from a university in northern Chile regarding the quality and relevance of the training they received during their undergraduate studies. The graduates express concerns about deficiencies in transferrable skills, such as 'teamwork', 'effective communication', and 'conflict resolution', as well as some technical skills that are vital for preparing graduates with social competences necessary for success in inter- and transdisciplinary contexts, essential in fostering positive interactions between society and the ocean. The study proposes curriculum updates and a strategy for establishing a bidirectional link with Marine Biology graduates, including mutual feedback, fostering graduate loyalty, strengthening ties to the working world, and implementing accountability processes. These aspects are critical in professional training, contributing to the optimisation of curricular plans, enhancing employability, and improving job performance across all disciplines and higher education institutions.

AB  - Educators and policy makers have advocated for reform of undergraduate biology education, calling for greater integration of mathematics and physics in the biology curriculum. While these calls reflect the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of biology research, crossing disciplinary boundaries in the classroom carries epistemological challenges for both instructors and students. In this paper we expand on the construct of authenticity to better describe and understand disciplinary practices, in particular, to examine those used in undergraduate physics and biology courses. We then apply these ideas to examine an introductory biology course that incorporates physics and mathematics. We characterize how instructors asked students to use interdisciplinary tools in this biology course and contrast them with the typical uses of these tools in physics courses. Finally, we examine student responses to the use of mathematics and physics in this course, to better understand the challenges and consequences of using interdisciplinary tools in introductory courses. We link these results to the reform initiatives of introductory physics courses for life-science students. (Contains 2 figures, 1 table, and 6 footnotes.)

AB  - Programming is an interdisciplinary practice with applications in both mathematics and computer science. Mathematics concerns rigor, abstraction, and generalization. Computer science predominantly concerns efficiency, concreteness, and physicality. This makes programming a medium for problem solving that mediates between mathematics and computer science in intriguing ways. Behind programming practices is computational thinking (CT), a mode of thinking involved in formulating and solving problems so that the solutions could be represented and carried out by computing means. In this paper, CT is seen as a boundary object connecting mathematics and computer science in a school problem-solving context. In particular, we examine and analyse middle school students' work upon engaging in mathematical problem solving-in a programming environment, taking CT as a boundary object embedded in the block-based programming environment, Scratch. The analysis is guided by observing boundary crossing features of CT in the students' artefacts produced in Scratch while solving mathematical problems related to symmetry and arithmetic sequence. The findings of this study open up new dimensions to explore CT as a boundary object in integrated STEM pedagogy.

AB  - Because interdisciplinary thinking is critical to address complex issues, we created and evaluated an interdisciplinary team-taught undergraduate course on mental illness using the kaleidoscope approach. After grounding students in biology, psychology and sociology, we aimed to develop students' abilities to think interdisciplinarily and cultivate their appreciation of the importance of integration. We found that guided integration practice enhanced students' interdisciplinary abilities, whereas repeated application of these skills emphasized their importance. Future interdisciplinary courses should intertwine both types of experiences to increase the likelihood students develop integration abilities and choose to apply them to solve complex problems facing our world.

AB  - This study examines cybersecurity awareness in universities by analyzing related research output across different disciplines at the University of Johannesburg. The diffusion of innovation theory is used in this study as a theoretical framework to explain how cybersecurity awareness diffuses across disciplines. The University of Johannesburg Institutional Repository database was the data source for this study. Variations in cybersecurity keyword searches and topic modeling techniques were used to identify the frequency and distribution of research output across different disciplines. The study reveals that cybersecurity awareness has diffused across various disciplines, including non-computer science disciplines such as business, accounting, and social sciences. However, there are significant differences in cybersecurity awareness across academic disciplines, highlighting the need for targeted efforts to promote cybersecurity awareness in underrepresented academic disciplines and for intra and interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - The great development of high-throughput molecular biology techniques and the consequent generation of massive data have made Bioinformatics essential for undergraduate Bioscience students. The importance of this scientific discipline is evidenced by the huge number of specialized publications, tools, and databases available. Training in Bioinformatics equips undergraduates with transferable skills that can be applied in all fields of Biology, such as programming abilities, data analysis, database management, biological knowledge, statistics, problem solving, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Over the past decade, there has been a notable increase in the number of higher education institutions worldwide that have adopted a competency-based curricula. This approach places a significant emphasis on the actions and skills that students are expected to develop, rather than merely focusing on the information, they are required to memorize. In this educational context, the use of active learning strategies has been demonstrated to enhance student comprehension and competency development. This paper describes the implementation of an active learning approach in a hands-on lesson performed by undergraduate students of Biology at the University of Malaga (Spain). Its main objective is to introduce students to molecular databases and information search systems on genes, proteins, and phylogeny. This is achieved within the framework of a smart campus, which integrates technological and sustainable resources to promote a positive and productive learning environment for the university community. This work presents the content and procedure of this practical activity, as well as the evaluation method and the results of a student survey to assess their opinions.

AB  - An interdisciplinary approach has been adopted for undergraduate Law and Social Science students attending separate seven-week intensive language communication courses run at the University of Helsinki. The challenge has been to anchor this pedagogical development within theoretical frames of reference that contextualise the interdisciplinary PBL simulation. Focus is placed on one of the simulations - Bradford Simulation, based on the 1995 riots involving the Pakistani immigrant community in the English city of Bradford. Conflict encompasses multidimensional problems and synthesising interdisciplinarity with the PBL simulation attempts to create a learning environment in which students can gain an insight into the intricacies of conflict analysis, management and resolution. Considerations of student identity and learning factors are recognised. Key operational management factors requiring advanced organisational and communication skills by the teacher are also broached. Whilst positive outcomes have accrued there are limitations that have compromised the activity.

AB  - The importance of developing students' argumentation skills is well established across the curriculum: students should grasp how claims are made and supported in different disciplines. One challenge is to follow and thereby agree with or critique the arguments of others, which requires perspective-taking, in tracing these other reasons and reasoning. This challenge is increased when disciplines construct argumentation and perspective-taking differently. Here, we consider the role of perspective-taking in argumentation within and between science education and pluralistic religious education, where the former aims at the justification of scientific claims and the latter at both an empathetic understanding of different religions and worldviews, and personal reasoning. We interpretively analyze student data to identify salient features of students' strategies to perspective-taking within argumentation.¬†Data from 324 pupils across nine schools are¬†explored in relation to students' challenges in perspective-taking, strategies for perspective-taking within argumentation, and the use of perspective-taking to construct personal argumentation. The analysis shows some barriers to perspective-taking within argumentation, the range of students' perspective-taking strategies within argumentation, and how personal argumentation could hermeneutically build upon perspective-taking strategies. The importance and implications of perspective-taking within argumentation across the curriculum are considered highlighting challenges in the etic/emic shift, both within the individual subject as well as across them, and some reflections on how this provides a fresh pedagogical perspective on the science/religions debate are made. To end, we conclude with the wider challenges for disciplines and perspective-taking across schooling and university.

AB  - Innovative models of teaching through research have broken the long-held paradigm that core chemistry competencies must be taught with predictable, scripted experiments. We describe here five fundamentally different, course-based undergraduate research experiences that integrate faculty research projects, accomplish ACS accreditation objectives, provide the benefits of an early research experience to students, and have resulted in publishable findings. The model detailed is the Freshman Research Initiative (FRI) at The University of Texas at Austin. While there are currently 30+ active FRI research groups, or "streams", we focus this report on five different chemistry streams in these four areas (organic, inorganic, analytical, and biochemistry) to demonstrate how general chemistry laboratory skills are taught in the context of these varied research disciplines. To illustrate the flexibility of the FRI model for teaching first-year chemistry, we show how each stream teaches students three different skills within the context of their research: making (synthesis), measuring (UV-vis spectroscopy), and characterization. As a unifying example, all five chemistry streams describe using UV-vis spectroscopy to characterize new synthetic molecules, complexes, and compounds, followed by extensive quantitative collection, processing, and analysis of experimental data sets. The FRI model allows full integration of training in mandatory and accredited general chemistry skill sets with open-ended research experiences with unexpected outcomes in undergraduate science curricula. In turn, this model enables undergraduates to be productive contributors to new knowledge and scientific discovery at the earliest levels of the undergraduate experience.

AB  - The impact of hate speech, both on a personal and social level, has increased due to social media. This has made it the focus of interest of numerous scientific journals, which increases the visibility of this global problem. The aim of this research is to analyse the basic descriptive metrics of the scientific production on hate speech and social media, as well as to explore the interdisciplinarity of these approaches. A bibliometric study has been carried out on the basis of the works indexed in the Scopus database related to the binomial 'hate speech' and 'social media' over a period of 20 years (2001 to 2020). The metrics used show that it is from 2017 onwards when this topic begins to arouse greater interest among researchers and that they constitute a sufficient indicator to consider the topic as one of interest to the scientific community. The joint research between both concepts raises its quality levels from a strictly metric point of view. 'Computer Science' and 'Social Sciences' are the two areas that clearly define the scientific production on this subject. The inversion of percentages in terms of the areas of origin of the works and citations in these two areas, is evidence of this interdisciplinarity. The indicators obtained show the relevance and transcendence of a social problem in the face of which proactive measures must be implemented.

AB  - This study adopted a meta-analysis to explore the effectiveness of unplugged activities (UA) and programming exercises (PE) teaching approaches on computational thinking (CT) education. Through a two-stage literature collection and selection process, 29 articles were included in the meta-analysis, 31 independent effect sizes (16 of UA and 15 of PE) from these articles were used, and a total of 2,764 participants were involved in these studies. CMA software version 3.3 was used to analyze the collected data. The result of the meta-analysis showed that both the UA and PE teaching approaches are useful in cultivating students' CT. Besides, the effect of the PE teaching approach is better than the UA teaching approach in CT education. Moreover, we analyzed the effect of moderator variables (grade level, interdisciplinary course, and experiments duration) on the relationship between UA or PE and CT education. The results showed that the effects of UA teaching approach in CT education was stronger (a) for primary school students than for secondary school students, (b) in interdisciplinary courses than in computer science courses, (c) with long duration teaching experiments than with medium and short duration teaching experiments. However, these effects are not significant. The effects of the PE teaching approach in CT education were stronger (a) for secondary school students than for primary school students, (b) in interdisciplinary courses than in computer science courses, (c) with short duration teaching experiments than with long and medium duration teaching experiments. These effects are not significant either. Therefore, we suggest that (1) the UA teaching approach should be used more for primary school students, while the PE teaching approach should be used more for secondary students; (2) CT education should be integrated into other subjects through UA and PE teaching approaches; and (3) the UA teaching approach requires more teaching time than the PE teaching approach does in CT education.

AB  - The integration of science within an agricultural education classroom is very important. This study explored the influences CASE professional development institutes had on the teacher-participant's perceptions of science integration and inquiry-based instruction. This study utilized a pre and post-test comprised of the integrative science survey and the inquiry-based teaching techniques. We attempted a census of all (N = 38) high school agricultural educators who were participants in the Principles of Agricultural Science-Plant (ASP) and the Agricultural Power and Technology (APT) CASE institutes. Overall, respondents had more positive perceptions of science integration and IBI following the CASE institutes. Teacher educators should incorporate inquiry-based teaching techniques and examples of integrating science into preparation programs and offer professional development workshops to practicing teachers. Future research should take a deeper look into the impacts of CASE institutes on teachers' attitudes towards science integration and implementation of IBI in their classrooms. A larger population of teachers needs to be studied with the study taking a longitudinal approach to focus on the long-term implementation of IBI in the agricultural education classroom.

AB  - Although existing data science educational programmes develop talent and produce graduates, business-focused data science curricula comprising essential skills oriented to business and managerial data with associated analysis, remain underserved. Current pedagogy has focused either on data science or on purely analytic technical aspects. There is therefore, an opportunity to rethink how institutions can develop innovative data-focussed education programmes, addressing both modern industry and community demands. As both academia and industry strive to integrate applied learning, transferable and enterprise skills into business and sciences, this paper proposes a design based research approach (DBR) for designing such a new interdisciplinary data science teaching curriculum as a foundation to deliver business undergraduate degrees in Business Data Science. Adopting a design science method our proposed DBR illustrates effective utilities for conceptualising and evaluating a fully functional new degree programme -- Bachelor of Business Data Science. Ten senior business information systems academics and five analytics industry practitioners in Victoria, Australia were interviewed in three iterative prototyping phases followed by a final focus group session with business information systems students that evaluated the proposed structure. The findings suggest that proposed DBR ensures the design of an innovative data science degree that may meet growing industry and interdisciplinary demands. The paper concludes by discussing overall feasibility of the proposal in the Australian higher education sector, particularly for the case context of an Australian University.

AB  - In the midst of future-oriented dialogues within the field, we turned our attention broadly toward the multiplicity of educational approaches that might characterize U.S. K-12 art education today. Through large-scale descriptive survey research (N = 742), we explored K-12 art teachers' emphasis on 10 common educational approaches: choice-based art education/teaching for artistic behavior (TAB); community-based education; discipline-based art education (DBAE); design education; ecological/environmental education; interdisciplinary education or arts integration; multicultural education; social justice; science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)/science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM); and visual/material culture. The results confirm we are in a period of plurality, albeit more defined by visual/material culture and multicultural education. The range of ways in which these 10 educational approaches can exhibit theoretically and in practice raises a number of critical questions. We recommend any future sketches of the field explore these nuances--delving deeper into how each of these curricular movements is conceptualized and enacted in K-12 art education practice.

AB  - Contribution: This research paper contributes to engineering education research with a framework for interdisciplinary learning outcomes based on students' experiences from participation in an interdisciplinary project for engineering students. A theoretical frame of reference is developed to analyze students' experience with interdisciplinary projects. Background: Engineers are important stakeholders in solving complex global challenges, and faculties have a very important role in educating engineers with the necessary competences. However, research finds many challenges when engineering students work with complex problems in an interdisciplinary setting crossing different disciplinary boundaries. Research Question: What cognitive learning outcomes are experienced by engineering students when working on interdisciplinary problem-based projects across engineering disciplines? Methodology: The case study draws on insights from interdisciplinary projects involving students from different yet related disciplines (referred to as narrow interdisciplinary projects) in spring 2022. The study followed 18 engineering groups during the spring semester of 2022. The students were all from The Faculty of Engineering and Science and belonging to the programs: Energy, Materials & Production, and Construction. The students worked together in clusters on different narrow interdisciplinary engineering projects (leadENG). Data was collected through eight qualitative group interviews and observations from meetings, status seminars, etc. Interview data was transcribed and analyzed in NVivo using a data-driven approach and afterward categorized according to the model for learning outcomes. Findings: A list of intended learning outcomes was compiled for students working on narrow interdisciplinary problems in relation to interdisciplinary understanding, reflexivity, enactment, and coordination. The findings highlight the importance of coordination in an interdisciplinary setup and suggest more focus on student leadership in engineering education.

AB  - "A third space" can be unlocked through collaborative efforts between out-of-school organisations (like museums) and schools. By bridging museum and school contexts, blurring boundaries between disciplines and shifting between multiple perspectives on a subject, a "third space," can contribute to meaningful science education. However, resources that support collaboration between museum educators and teachers are required. The educational design of a "third space" between museums and schools can enable "an experience" informed by context-based, interdisciplinary, and value-centred teaching strategies. This study conceptualises and validates the "Alma-L√∂v-Programme" ("ALP"), a museum resource designed to support students' interdisciplinary, and value-centred learning in a "third space." It applies an art-based teaching strategy that encourages student groups to address science issues depicted by contemporary art. Comparison of the "Alma-L√∂v-Programme" design guidelines to the design instantiations of the established "Framework for Museum Practice" showed that they are largely consistent. However, noted distinctions indicate several factors that may be important for preparation and exploration of a "third space." The findings can inform the design of activities and programmes by educators in the out-of-school sector.

AB  - The notion of family resemblance has recently emerged as a promising and fruitful approach to characterising the nature of science (NOS) in science education research, offering solutions to some perplexing challenges such as capturing both the domain-general and domain-specific features of science with a single framework. At the same time, however, criticism has been levelled that the resemblance might eventually extend to certain activities that are not scientific but pose as science. This would be an undesirable consequence for science educators, particularly given the increasing need for individuals to discern pseudoscientific claims circulated on social media from scientific information. Many pseudoscientific and non-scientific activities resemble science in terms of their aim to explain nature, their use of evidence-based methods, and their interrelation with politics and society. In this theoretical article, we build on the concept of family resemblance to consider how it can simultaneously explain the diversity and unity of science and help students to learn about the nature of science and that of pseudoscience in science education. We put forward three principles that can guide teaching about pseudoscience based on the family resemblance conceptualisation of science.

AB  - The Literacy Design Collaborative (LDC) was created to support teachers in implementing college and career readiness standards. Teachers work collaboratively with coaches to further develop their expertise and design standards-driven, literacy-rich writing assignments within their existing curriculum across all content areas. Findings from multiple sources reveal positive results for the LDC intervention. Participants across all groups reported positive attitudes toward LDC and perceived a positive impact on student outcomes. Additionally, analysis of student outcomes confirmed participants' positive views. We found LDC had statistically significant effects on Cohort 2 middle school students' English language arts (ELA) performance, with an effect size of .15 for students receiving LDC instruction in all three core content areas: ELA, science, and social studies/history.

AB  - Science and art are intrinsically linked. Science requires curiosity, along with skills in observation, problem-solving, and critical thinking. Art is no different; however, the two disciplines are typically presented as opposites to children at a young age and the emphasis on differences lead to a false dichotomy of career paths and even self-identification. Recent research has shown that integrating artistic disciplines such as creative writing into traditional STEM fields aids both majors and non-majors in establishing interdisciplinary connections between required education courses and courses in their field of interest, resulting in increased student learning and understanding. This study incorporated creative writing into a college-level entomology course through writing prompts where students observed magnified images of arthropods and other objects and described them using creative language. The students were also encouraged to engage with the course material through personal experiences and reflections. We discovered that this creative writing assignment helped students gain confidence in their writing abilities, foster new connections through critical thinking, and develop a deeper appreciation for entomology. In addition, this exercise helps instructors identify student's misconceptions, establish baseline class knowledge, and connect facets of multiple disciplines to meet learning objectives.

AB  - Critical Physical Geography (CPG) emerged as a discipline around 2014 and has since excited many human and physical geographers, as well researchers in political ecology, geomorphology, science and technology, and environmental science whose research, critiques, and methodologies have formed much of the basis of CPG. However, because of its recent emergence as a discipline, and because of the challenges in teaching transdisciplinary methods, there is a scarcity of literature on methods to teach CPG. The needs for these methods are exceedingly important right now as unprecedented, wicked environmental problems of the Anthropocene continue to emerge, and as structures of power, which have artificially separated the study of humans and the environment, are re-evaluated. CPG provides instructors with cross-disciplinary tools to explore environmental problems, and besides its focus on intertwining biophysical and social methodologies, it emphasizes environmental and social justice, as well critical explorations of power and knowledge production. This paper provides an example of methodologies used to teach a CPG class on contamination in community gardens where students examined how environmental justice policies and funding initiatives failed to reduce high concentrations of contamination in each garden.

AB  - There have been calls for Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education to become more interdisciplinary, reflecting the reality of contemporary research. However, communicating across disciplines is challenging. In this article, I explore what and how students read in the STEM disciplines. I provide an overview of key topics in literacy research, and discuss the disciplinary nature of literacy. I compare disciplinary literacy requirements in STEM through thematic analysis of UK quality subject benchmark statements, which identifies considerable variation in the expectations of undergraduates to engage with primary research literature. I explore implications this has for interdisciplinary teaching, and present some published pedagogical strategies for engaging students in research literature. I call on STEM educators to embed inclusive disciplinary literacy teaching within curricula to support students in their reading. I also highlight the need for clear understanding of disciplinary conventions and reading expectations when designing interdisciplinary educational programmes.

AB  - The examination of teacher educators' own practices through self-study research has been well established and self-study aligns with the growing interest in open educational resources (OER) and open pedagogy. This research used a self-study method of a Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics (STEAM) OER project, Form and Function(s): Sustainable Design meets Computational Thinking. Two research questions were pursued: How do open pedagogy attributes contribute to a transdisciplinary STEAM OER pedagogical stance? And how can one apply visual artifact self-study as intentional critical friends to examine professional value and to enhance pedagogical self-understanding? The researcher analyzed visual artifacts of created and documented images that supported the process of her interrogations of transdisciplinary curriculum development and open pedagogy. The sites and modalities of the artifacts were questioned and answers recorded using a critical visual methodology. Klein's (2008, 2018) transdisciplinary thinking and the eight attributes of Hegarty's (2015) open pedagogy frame the interrogation of the images and the connections made to curriculum theorizing. The self-study provides conclusions to the role of visual artifacts when conceptualizing the gestalt of complex ideas and relations. The self-study provides warranted assertions for open educators and researchers interested in the practices of transdisciplinary, open curricular and pedagogical processes alongside the eight attributes of open pedagogy, and the role of critical self-reflection.

AB  - This article presents a possible framework for the cooperation of mathematics and physics education research domains. Moreover, the potential topics for such a scientific collaboration are explained by means of a structuring qualitative content analysis of current handbooks and conference proceedings in Germany and Vietnam. These topics can form a basis for further projects on the connection of subject-related didactics. One of these projects is an interdisciplinary course in teacher training at the Hanoi National University of Education (HNUE) as part of the Inter TeTra project between the HNUE and the University of Siegen.

AB  - Decision making about complex socioscientific issues (SSI) involves recognizing and weighing tradeoffs among conflicting values and stakeholder outcomes. A vital but difficult practice, engaging in tradeoffs allows decision-makers to engage in perspective-taking, and also identify that not all their desired goals may be fulfilled by a policy. However, the science education field has not clearly defined tradeoffs practices or operationalized instruction about tradeoffs. Our primary goal was to define features of a tradeoff practice supported by a literature review and explore undergraduates' tradeoff practices within an interdisciplinary science literacy course focused on SSI decision making. As a result of our analysis, we propose three important features of tradeoff reasoning: internal consistency, multiple perspectives, and alternatives comparison strategies, which represent a broader understanding of specific goals students can achieve and educators can assess. Our work more holistically defines student tradeoff practices across the entire decision-making process and lays a theoretical foundation for researching students' tradeoffs practices in an SSI-context. Our study may aid educators in identifying how students consider tradeoffs when decision making about complex SSI and recognizing challenges to refine educational programming aimed at enhancing students' decision-making skills to support science literacy.

AB  - The aim of this research was to examine the effects of a new platform for raising the pre-service chemistry and geography teachers' awareness of cooperation possibilities associated with the planning relevant interdisciplinary lesson. The research featured the participation of 16 students of the Faculty of Chemistry and 28 students of the Faculty of Geography of Belgrade University. Two workshops were conducted within the research. During the first workshop the participants worked in small groups on the tasks which served to strengthen their awareness on the relevant science education. The second workshop comprised the jointly planning the interdisciplinary lessons in groups with members of the pre-service teachers of both subjects. The participants' lesson plans contain goals that can be classified as those relevant for the individual and those relevant for society. Half of the lesson plans contained formulations of goals that can be assessed as relevant for certain professions. The activities planned for the attainment of the stated goals support an interdisciplinary approach, encompass the concepts envisaged by the chemistry and geography curricula, and the activities specific to these two subjects.

AB  - Purpose: The current article on social studies in primary and secondary education in Norway covers a range of relevant topics which starts with a brief context of Norwegian society, history and social studies framework. Main topics are the new (2020) curriculum, textbooks analyses, social studies teacher competence and practices followed by research in social studies. Findings: The original data on teacher practice reveal that teachers talking while using textbooks is (still) a dominant form of practice in Norway, but there is a great variety of practices both in and out of school (excursions). The textbooks still aim at being 'neutral' and less critical. A new national curriculum from November 2019 emphasises interdisciplinarity subjects, and have less goals than the previous 2006, but is still very specific and rather top down. Some research is presented, the field is under researched, and an outlook is discussed.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to explain the relevance of science-society interfaces and their potential for higher education institutions to engage stakeholders in supporting sustainable change in cities, via the transdisciplinary learning and teaching approach of the Regional Centre of Expertise on Education for Sustainable Development Vienna. Design/Methodology/Approach: This case study stresses new forms of transdisciplinary learning and teaching as essential drivers of a sustainable urban development. The inter- and transdisciplinary teaching course "Sustainability Challenge", which has been offered since 2010 as a collaborative project by the four largest universities of Vienna, highlights the value of experienced-based learning approaches and the method of service learning. Special attention is devoted to the opportunities and challenges of the setting provided by the applied science-society interface and the particular method of service learning with its concrete benefits for the city of Vienna. Findings: In analyzing the conceptual framework of the teaching course as well as conducted service learning projects, the authors prove potential benefits of transdisciplinary learning and teaching for real answers to urban sustainability challenges. Portraits of the most successful service learning projects are presented, with partners such as the City of Vienna, an organization and one enterprise. Lessons learned from the case study and key elements of the institutionalized umbrella function of science-society interfaces that provide prerequisites for applying transdisciplinary learning and teaching are shown. Originality/Value: Finally, main requirements, challenges and necessary institutional settings for transdisciplinary learning and teaching are summarized.

AB  - Contribution: Prior studies on pedagogical methodologies to acquire soft skills have shown that developing collaborative tasks produces positive impact in students' abilities. In this article, a pedagogical approach based on interdisciplinary practice and realistic problems is proposed to improve students' teamwork skills. Background: Traditionally, soft skill acquisition has received scarce attention in high education curricula. Consequently, students finish their studies without having developed important competencies, such as communication, conflict resolution and teamwork skills. Intended Outcomes: Students who follow a realistic interdisciplinary approach improve both their soft and hard skills compared to students who follow a traditional collaborative pedagogical methodology. Through the approach proposed, students progress in completing tasks, participating in the team, collaborating in the organization, accepting agreements and taking into account the others' points of view. Application Design: The experience involved students from two different disciplines, prospective computer science engineers and preservice teachers. They worked together to design an educational application that required prospective engineers to apply Human-Computer Interaction fundamentals. A quasi-experimental study was performed using either knowledge tests or self-assessment pre-post-tests, both subsequently analyzed using quantitative methods. Findings: 1) The prospective CS engineers who followed the interdisciplinary realistic practice approach achieved better learning outcomes than those who did not; 2) the educational context affects teamwork skill development; and 3) students improved their ability to work and participate in the team after the experience.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is a historic global event that has extended to all parts of society and shaken the core of what we know and how we live. During this pandemic, the work of STEM professionals has taken center stage. Through our close observations of how the events of the pandemic have been unfolding across the globe, we propose an instructional framework that emerged out of the real-time responses of STEM professionals to explain the pandemic and find solutions. This framework centers on data science, computer science, and multidisciplinary convergence as tools for engaging K-12 students in complex societal problems like the pandemic. In this theoretical position statement, we propose our framework that is grounded in three areas: (a) data science and computer science, (b) multidisciplinary convergence, and (c) orientation and support for science teachers specifically and STEM teachers broadly to prepare them for fundamentally different roles. Using data and computer models, students find phenomena and problems compelling, appreciate the power and potential of STEM subjects, and explain phenomena and design solutions to real-world problems. Then, through multidisciplinary convergence, individuals and societies integrate STEM disciplinary knowledge and practices to make informed decisions and take responsible actions. As STEM teachers engage students in explaining phenomena and solving complex societal problems with data science and computer science through the convergence of multiple STEM subjects, teachers take on roles that are fundamentally different from the roles they have traditionally played.

AB  - To build a sustainable future, science and engineering education programmes should emphasise scientific investigation, collaboration across traditional science topics and disciplines, and engineering design, including design and evaluation of solutions. While some research studies articulate the shifts that are needed to realise classroom learning emphasizing investigation and design, fewer research studies help us to understand how we co-design these instructional programmes, including how experts from different essential disciplines collaborate towards an interdisciplinary instructional programme. We adopted a qualitative case study design to address the research question, "What is the process of team co-construction of instructional materials that emphasize learning through both science investigation and engineering design?" The paper outlines the first year of our team co-construction activities involving the design, implementation, and evaluation of instructional materials for secondary science. Qualitative data included semi-structured interviews with nine team members and documentation in form of researcher field notes and learning artefacts. Two cycles of coding resulted in five major themes that served as the basis for the five-phase model of team co-construction of instructional materials. This study provides information on the kinds of partnerships and collaboration needed to realise instructional programmes for students' study of the interdisciplinary STEM-based challenges of tomorrow.

AB  - We suggest that two interpretations of time -- linear time and cyclical time -- that complement each other when planning lessons, can be used in both Western and Indigenous science. The idea of time in the Australian Curriculum: Science is examined and seen to be primarily associated with the Western science tradition, so it is suggested that the curriculum could be more inclusive of Indigenous ways of thinking with transdisciplinary links to mathematics also being included. It is suggested that the inclusion of the 'Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Histories and Cultures' cross-curriculum priority into science can be achieved in three ways: as Indigenous perspectives, through the Two-Ways approach, and through the Two-Ways approach with epistemic insight. Possible activities relating to seasons and cycles are suggested for the inclusion of these Indigenous perspectives in the science classroom.

AB  - A curricular approach to supporting low-income STEM Scholars is outlined and initial associations with retention, social and cultural capital, perception of science, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations are examined. Details are provided for the curricular support program based on interdisciplinary research, service learning, and an explicit examination of the interpretation of science based on culture and social location. We show that Scholars had increased retention and graduation within STEM majors compared to a control group. Further, Scholars self-report in surveys and interviews increased social and cultural capital, motivation, and related outcomes that they attribute to the interdisciplinary coursework that comprises the bulk of the program.

AB  - To promote rich discourse around scientific and engineering practices, teachers may turn to engineering design-based science curricula; however, this has discursive demands which have yet to be examined in a unit focused on integration of engineering and science. To investigate these discursive demands, we expand on the definition of discourse to include the ways of knowing, doing, talking, reading, writing, and context within science and engineering--and refer to these as disciplinary Discourses. The following major research question guided this study: how are multiple Discourses enacted by both the teacher during whole class discussions and students in small groups in an engineering design-based curricular unit? In this descriptive case study, we investigated these disciplinary Discourses in a design-based unit that focused on integration of engineering into a sixth-grade genetics unit through whole-class videos and audio recordings of a target student group. Our findings suggest that while the Discourses present in whole class discussions often reflected the focus of the daily lesson, this unit creates a space for multidisciplinary Discourse to emerge between science and engineering. Also, this teacher merged everyday and more technical disciplinary Discourses to scaffold the students' understanding. Finally, we observed multidisciplinary Discourses between science and engineering emerge in our student group, suggesting that students can successfully integrate the two disciplines. This study therefore begins to investigate the disciplinary Discourses present in a design-based curricular unit and specifically multidisciplinary Discourses that may enhance students' understanding of both science and engineering.

AB  - Official documents in several educational systems reflect the importance of integrating Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) and consider project-based learning (PBL) as a way of integrating such disciplines in the classroom. Although STEAM-PBL has been characterized and evaluated in different ways, its impact on school mathematics teaching remains unclear. Mathematics is recognized as the fundamental basis of other disciplines; however, many students still perceive it as a difficult subject and abandon it. To analyze STEAM-PBL classroom implementation from a school mathematics standpoint, we examined 41 classroom experiences from 11 Spanish secondary education teachers (five in-field mathematics teachers), who participated in a STEAM training program for more than 4¬†years. To frame this study, Thibaut et al.'s (J STEM Educ 3(1):02, 2018) and Schoenfeld's (Educ Res 43(8):404-412, 2014) characterizations of well-designed and implemented projects, respectively, were employed. The results showed that in-field mathematics teachers avoided transdisciplinary projects in which school mathematics is difficult to address, while out-of-field teachers tended to overlook the mathematics in interdisciplinary projects. Unlike out-of-field teachers, mathematics teachers often eluded design-based learning processes for deeply exploiting school mathematics. The latter teachers promoted high cognitive demands and positive perceptions about mathematics in projects where formative environments¬†were generated¬†through discussion¬†and¬†a¬†meaningful feedback loop.

AB  - Evaluation practices are continuing to evolve, particularly in those areas related to formative, participatory, and improvement approaches. Improvement science is one of the evaluative practices. Its strength is that it seeks to embrace stakeholders' and frontline workers' knowledge and experience, who are often tasked with leading improvement activities in their organizations. However, very little guidance exists on how to develop crucial improvement capacity. Evaluation capacity building literature has the potential to fill this gap. This multiple methods case study follows a networked improvement community's first year in a public education setting as network leaders sought to build capacity by incorporating Preskill and Boyle's multidisciplinary model as its guiding framework. The purpose of this study was to better understand how to build improvement science capacity, along with what facilitates implementation and beneficial learnings. This article ends by reconceptualizing and extending Preskill and Boyle's model to improvement science networks.

Yet, it is exactly what the Italian secondary-school graduation exam requires in its oral part. Although it has been criticized by teachers and students, here I provide a list of real school life examples and discuss why this can be a great, innovative opportunity for physics teachers to highlight the cultural power and richness of the discipline they teach.

AB  - As part of their third-year general chemistry program, students at the University of the C√¥te d'Azur are taught the basics of radioactivity. The view that third-year university students have of the periodic Table of the Elements is often reduced because it ignores the vast majority of isotopes. As part of this program, a practicum devoted to the observation of [alpha] and [beta] particles has been put in place and a table-top version of a cloud chamber of the Langsdorf type was designed, but in its simpler, static version. With a simple experiment and a source of natural uranium, concepts that normally belong to the distinct disciplines of thermodynamics, classical point physics, nuclear instability, and even chemistry are being addressed in a complementary manner. This article gives a full description of the various concepts that may be taught during the practicum, together with the basic equations. Numerical applications performed with observed data are proposed and discussed together with tabulated data. Through this practicum, students can actually observe radioactivity directly and come to understand that nuclides may be stable or unstable.

AB  - Background: Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (NST) have been recognized as an emerging technology of the 21st century. The interdisciplinary nature and remarkable applications of NST have prompted science education researchers to recognize its potential in science teaching. NST have also been acknowledged as a vital field in technology in order to understand the socio-scientific issues of innovations as described by the EU framework of Responsible Research & Innovation (RRI). Purpose: The current paper focuses on the design and implementation of a teaching learning sequence (TLS) for 6th Grade primary students. Our aim is to investigate how primary students approach basic concepts of NST and to what extent they can reflect on RRI issues. Program description: The described TLS is focused on size and scale and on the change of properties at the nanoscale based on hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials, while RRI issues are discussed through newspaper articles and students' interaction with nanoscientists. Sample: 45 6th Grade primary students from Greece took part in the study during the academic school year 2014-15.Design and methods: The teacher who taught the TLS also assisted in creating its design through collaborating with experts from the field of NST, science education and science communication. Data was collected through students' worksheets and interviews with students. For the data analysis, qualitative methods of content analysis were used. Results: The results showed that primary students can successfully understand NST key concepts like 'size and scale' and 'size-dependent properties'. Regarding the dimensions of RRI, NST appear to be a useful context for enhancing students' discussions more about Ethics, Engagement and Science Education and less about issues related to Gender Equality, Open Access and Governance. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that teaching NST is worthwhile even in primary education. Moreover, NST provide an appropriate context for the introduction of RRI in science education.

AB  - As the interconnectedness of the world grows, the need to prepare college students capable of addressing complexity likewise grows. In this context, the University of Dayton has developed and tested a transdisciplinary model for education. This model links multiple classes from different disciplines via a common theme and within a common space. It also employs an educational model premised on the following trajectory: disciplinary content development / transdisciplinary observation (empathy); transdisciplinary disruption leading to "A-Ha" observations which transform the disciplinary directions; and lastly transdisciplinary informed design and research. Central to this model is a 3,500 square foot common space used only by the classes participating in the experience. In this space classes share their reflections and content with other classes via both personal linkages and analog communications. The other classes respond to these from their disciplinary and personal perspectives. Thirteen classes, fourteen faculty, and over three-hundred students participated in a themed experience centered on the addiction crisis in Dayton, Ohio. Participants included faculty in applied creativity, engineering, health and sport science, education, theater, and religious studies. Also serving as co-teacher were community stakeholders. Assessment of the experience revealed variable student takeaways. Most prominent among these was student recognition that the experience had expanded their perspectives of the other disciplines. Most suggested that it had improved their ability to collaborate in a transdisciplinary environment and that it had significantly impacted their career aspirations. Fewer acknowledged the experience had improved their ability to create.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the practical work of learning designers with the aim of helping members of the information science (IS) and learning sciences (LS) communities understand how evidence-informed learning design of online teaching and online learning in higher education is relevant to their research agendas and how they can contribute to this growing field. Design/methodology/approach: Illustrating how current online education instructional designs largely ignore evidence from research, this paper argues that evidence from IS and LS can encourage more effective and nuanced learning designs for e-learning and online education delivery and suggest how interdisciplinary collaboration can advance shared understanding. Findings: Recent reviews of the learning design show that tools and techniques from the LS can support students in self-directed and self-regulated learning. IS studies complement these approaches by highlighting the role that information systems and computer--human interaction. In this paper, the expertise from IS and LS are considered as important evidence to improve learning design, particularly vis-√†-vis digital divide concerns that students face during the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value: This paper outlines important ties between the learning design, LS and IS communities. The combined expertise is key to advancing the nuanced design of online education, which considers issues of social justice and equity, and critical digital pedagogy.

AB  - In higher education, student retention challenges and advancing student diversity are not new. Such institutional student retention challenges and student diversity promotions continue to require more focus and effort. A means to help address student retention and improve student diversity through faculty engagement in classrooms is inclusive pedagogy. In this study, we inform researchers and practitioners about the current state of inclusive pedagogical research, including gaps addressing further needs of inclusive pedagogical research from a multi-disciplinary perspective, including science, technology, engineering, education, math, humanities, management, and economics. We also share a non_STEM-Focused versus STEM-Focused inclusive pedagogy literature perspective. Using the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) framework, we reviewed 304 articles to help shed light on existing inclusive pedagogy, focusing on three core competencies: inclusive communications, inclusive pedagogy practices, and the design of inclusive curriculum. Based on our discussion of findings and related implications for future research, we conclude that inclusive pedagogical research warrants improvement across all core competencies and academic disciplines to strengthen improvement of this research field. This study contributes to researchers and practitioners, especially those focusing inclusive pedagogy in classrooms, as well as the body of inclusive pedagogy knowledge.

AB  - In elementary education, virtual reality (VR) has been the subject of muchincreased research over the last ten years, with developed and developing nations making significant contributions. This research used a bibliometric approach to examine all publications published between 1994 and 2023, depending on this information. This study uses the VOS viewer tool and the Scopus database to analyse 365 articles. The results show that developed nations significantly contributed to publications and citations, especially in research and development, whereas developing nations were more interested in using technology in education. Journals in computer science and education now receive the most citations, which indicates the current focus on Virtual Reality in Elementary Education. The trend of greater collaboration among authors may be attributed to several variables, including, but not limited to, enhanced financing, higher author competency, and the rise of transdisciplinary studies. This collaborative effort facilitates the exchange of many viewpoints, expands the scope of insights in articles, and improves the editing and revising process. The terms "child," "reality," "technology," "approach," "intervention," "teaching," "augmented reality," "difference," "patient," and "process" are the top 10 keywords linked to virtual reality in elementary school research. Research relevance, influence, and acknowledgment within the scientific community may be ensured by matching research to keyword trends. The findings of this study could help future investigators choose research topics and pinpoint areas of interest.

AB  - The concept of sustainability has been gaining momentum in recent years as people are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental, social, and economic challenges facing the world. Sustainability is a complex issue that requires a multidisciplinary approach and long-term perspective. This study aimed to examine the perceptions and attitudes of science, primary school, and preschool teachers toward sustainability. The study involved 299 public school teachers, who were asked to complete a series of scales and questions to gauge their views on sustainability and sustainable development. The findings of this study indicate that preschool teachers take a more holistic approach to sustainability education, emphasizing the need to teach sustainability as a lifestyle and calling for improved teacher training in this area. On the other hand, primary school teachers placed greater emphasis on raising awareness of sustainability rather than inducing basic behavioral changes in children. Science teachers were more focused on acquiring knowledge and concepts related to sustainability. Overall, the study suggests that the effective implementation of sustainability education requires supporting materials and resources, and the support of school administration and families.

AB  - There is a notable shift towards prioritizing the teaching of engineering design within K-12 education, coupled with a strong recommendation for engineering design-based integrated STEM education. This approach underscores the sharing of science and engineering practices as a means to facilitate the learning of various STEM disciplines. Nonetheless, the implementation of integrated STEM education in rural schools poses challenges due to constrained resources and a shortage of high-quality programs. To present a tangible instance of design-based integrated STEM education within a rural setting, this study presents a model lesson that showcases the integration of interdisciplinary problem-solving skills within a genuine real-world context. This study examined how teacher collaboration for engineering and science shared practices influenced students' design process. Concurrent Think-Aloud (CTA) protocol data and design sketches produced by the student design teams during the protocol sessions display how they elicited their design thinking skills and STEM domain knowledge acquired from the integrated STEM lesson in an engineering design task. This study found that the students learned the model lesson through the fully integrated instruction between students and teachers utilized more balanced design cognitions than the silo approach of integration. The findings highlight that the utilization of engineering design in K-12 education to cultivate integrated problem-solving skills should be accompanied by domain-integrated instructions for effective implementation.

AB  - In the last twenty-five years' Romanian society sought solutions for the improvement of students' performances. Many problems were reported by diverse educational factors: students, parents, teachers, decisional factors and several solutions have been proposed. Our paper theoretically analyzes a possible solution to improve the students' academic performance and learning understanding: the educational team approach. Traditionally, teachers work alone in every step of the didactic process: student's assessment, planning, and implementation of the curriculum and monitoring student's progress. Current research demonstrates that team work in education has benefits both for teachers and students. A definition of the concept is proposed and some characteristics of an efficient educational team are taken into consideration. The three main team models, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary are critically analyzed and their benefits and disadvantages underlined. Also, possible solutions for practically implement this model in the Romanian educational context are proposed.

AB  - Today's school students are inheriting complex and harmful global challenges that are potentially irreversible and which they will need to address. The ability to think critically and creatively, to work in interdisciplinary teams and to understand the importance of a healthy planet for all life will be needed for success. Education has a major role in helping humanity achieve this. This article argues that transformations in both curriculum and pedagogy are required. It offers a potential conceptualisation and examples of what learning might look like to achieve these aims, exemplified by school science education as science will need to play a significant role if these global challenges are to be successfully met. This new conceptualisation draws upon Young's (2012, 2013) 'powerful knowledge' and the rather different approach found in Reiss and White's (2013) arguments for an 'aims-based' curriculum to propose curricula and associated pedagogies that can potentially address the global challenges of our times.

AB  - We report here on an effort to involve high school physics students in research on impacts of oil spills on marine mammals at a local university. We believe that the effort described here might be useful to others who would like to involve physics students in research, especially work of an interdisciplinary nature. The students learn to work independently and to communicate and collaborate in a professional environment. The directing high school teacher for this project was also a university graduate student involved in the university research project. The high school students used a computer program provided by the university to determine the types of passive acoustic marine mammal signals recorded, primarily whales and dolphins. The students got a taste of scientific research and of being part of a research group, very desirable qualities for future college graduates. Student feedback indicated that they enjoyed learning to work with the data and that they think they are more likely to go to college and major in a STEM-related field.

AB  - A series of laboratory experiments were developed to introduce first-year chemistry students to nanoscience through a green chemistry approach. Students made and characterized the stability of silver nanoparticles using two different methods: UV-visible spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering. They then assessed the ecotoxicity of silver nanoparticles in "Escherichia coli" sublethal growth curve assays. Bacterial growth was monitored via optical density and carbon dioxide measurements. Finally, students designed and implemented their own nanomaterial characterization and ecotoxicity experiments based upon the insights gained in previous tests. The experiments translated current research in sustainable nanomaterials to an undergraduate population while introducing them to research methodology and experiences early in their undergraduate career. Moreover, the experiments emphasized the interdisciplinary nature of the sciences to provide real-world applications and connect concepts learned within general chemistry lecture and lab to other classes commonly taken by first-year STEM students, including biology, materials science, and environmental sciences.

AB  - Community Service Learning (CSL) is an experiential learning approach that integrates community service into student projects and provides diverse learning opportunities to reduce interdisciplinary barriers. A semester-long chemistry curriculum with an integrated CSL intervention was implemented in a Canadian university to analyze the potential for engagement and positive attitudes toward chemistry as a meaningful undertaking for 14 post-secondary students in the laboratory as well as for their 400 K-12 student partners in the community. Traditionally, introductory science experiments typically involve repeating a cookbook recipe from a lab book, but this CSL project allowed the post-secondary and K-12 students to work collaboratively to determine the physical and chemical properties and total dissolved solids in the water fountains from the K-12 students' schools. Post-instructional surveys were completed by all learners and were analyzed using a mixed methodological approach with both quantitative and qualitative methods. The expected audience that may be interested in this study are those involved in teaching chemistry in higher education and at the K-12 level as well as those interested in service learning, community and civic engagement, experiential learning, and development of transferable skills in chemistry. The results demonstrate that both groups of students report favorable engagement and attitudes towards learning chemistry and higher self-confidence levels on performing lab skills after the activity. Furthermore, both groups of students expressed interest in exploring future projects, which is indicative of the positive impact of CSL and the mutual benefits of the partnership.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to discuss ways that a chemistry course could reposition itself by adopting interdisciplinary approaches based on systems thinking and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as overarching frameworks, to give an overview of several challenges that chemistry in higher education is facing, and to discuss how those can be addressed as a result of this repositioning. We will be discussing the need for a new type of scientist, one who has a deep understanding of their own discipline but also an overview of the links with other disciplines and is equipped with skills that will help them contribute to the solutions of a very complex system: the human--environment interaction system. Chemists should be part of what is described by earth systems' science as "the new social contract" between science and society. Finally, we will explore how this can be reflected in the curricula of higher education, and we will present a University of Bristol educational initiative, Bristol Futures, that attempts to address this.

AB  - As scientific literacy plays a contributing role in identifying, analysing, and solving environmental matters that our world is facing, there is growing consensus to mandate environmental matters in science classrooms following five decades of efforts in promoting environmental education. However, much remains unknown about the relationship between students' awareness of environmental matters and their science literacy scores on standardised test. Using data drawn from the 2015 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) science performance assessment, this study investigates the relationship between students' awareness of environmental matters and their science literacy scores in the context of established predictors for science learning. In all the regions' multilevel models ranging from medium to large effect sizes, a significant and positive relationship emerges between students' awareness of environmental matters and science literacy scores. Among the well-known predictors for science learning, student science self-efficacy associates positively with student science literacy scores across the regions. In contrast, inquiry-based science instruction associates negatively with the scores. Except for these two well-known predictors, variations exist in the relationships between other variables among the regions. Given all the regions' evidence showing the positive linkage between students' awareness of environmental matters and science literacy scores, the present study signifies the importance of integrating environmental issues into traditional science classrooms, suggesting that there should be systematic supports that enable both environmental and science educators to collaborate towards the development of an interdisciplinary environmental science curriculum.

AB  - Our current multicultural societies require that education addresses diversity and promotes cultural awareness and intercultural learning. Mathematics and science education can also contribute to this aspect of citizenship education and create a culture of belonging for all students. Professional development that integrates intercultural learning with educational practices is still uncommon in the field of science and mathematics teacher preparation and support. This study explores the possibilities to support science and mathematics teachers in implementing intercultural learning through a professional development course. The course was developed in a European setting, based on a theoretical analysis, and tried out with 319 teachers from six participating countries. The impact of the course on teachers' take up of intercultural learning was measured with a pre-post questionnaire. We found that the course strengthened teachers' self-efficacy beliefs and extended their teaching practices with opportunities created by cultural diversity among their students or in their subjects. In addition to that, teachers' self-efficacy beliefs and the perceived cultural diversity in class appeared to be influencing factors for teachers' practices. Based on our findings we recommend that the combination of intercultural learning with educational practices of mathematics and science might be a suitable gateway to provide new intercultural learning opportunities for students.

AB  - The expansion of ethics review, beyond its origins in medical research, is the subject of growing critical analysis internationally, especially from social science researchers. Our study builds on this analysis by considering ethics review specifically within tertiary-based educational research. As a foundation for a larger study, we explore the reporting of ethics review within articles from a snapshot of education journals. A cross-sectional review considered 125 articles from 24 journals spanning medical and nurse education, the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, and educational technology. Among similar types of research our findings highlight variation in institutional ethical review processes and outcomes. Despite most journals providing guidelines for reporting ethics review, adherence to these guidelines by authors or editors was not always evident, but more likely in health-related education journals. We argue that identified areas of variation may reflect the differing influence and proximity of biomedical values. This influence has been under examined in tertiary-based educational research but may contribute to inequitable learning, researching and publishing experiences, potentially adding to negative sentiment about ethics review.

AB  - STEAM education puts professional learning communities on the agenda by requiring teacher collaboration along with disciplinary integrity. In this study, a professional learning community in STEAM education was investigated by observing 49 teachers from different disciplines working in different districts during 16 weeks of interdisciplinary training and their practice with students. Teachers' perceptions of skills teaching self-efficacy, design self-efficacy and perceptions of interdisciplinary teaching were assessed using pre-post tests. The research concluded that the STEAM professional learning community study positively improved teachers' perceptions of skill teaching self-efficacy and interdisciplinary teaching, but was not sufficient to develop design self-efficacy. It was found that teachers' views of practice were positive and that interdisciplinary collaboration contributed to this. In light of the research findings, it was suggested that the use of professional learning communities in STEAM education may be an effective example of the interdisciplinary functioning of hands-on workshops.

AB  - The "Next Generation Science Standards" and other educational reforms support the formation of deep connections across the STEM disciplines. Integrated STEM is considered as a best practice by the educational communities of the disparate disciplines. However, the integration of non-STEM disciplines is understudied and generally limited to the integration of art (STEAM). Humanistic STEM blends the study of STEM with interest in and concern for human affairs, welfare, values, or culture. This study looks at an infusion of the humanities into an online chemistry course to see if there is an influence on student connection between course content and cross-disciplinary perspectives. Specifically, students were asked about the course making clear connection to STEM disciplines, between science and non-science, between science and the real world, and a widened perspective of science connection other courses in their degree programs. Items on a Likert scale were presented as part of the end of course evaluations and yielded 59 responses. Although no statistically significant difference in the pre- and post-infusion agreement, it is evident that the additional perspectives did no harm. The positive movement in this pilot study encourages further investigation with stronger infusions of both STEM and humanities content.

AB  - This paper investigates the intricate relationship between universities as socio-academic institutions, society at large, and technology. Through a general analysis, we aim to comprehend how a multidisciplinary university mediates and catalyzes the interaction between technology and society. Our examination encompasses both theoretical foundations and practical considerations, examining the ways interdisciplinary approaches facilitate this relationship within the context of technocapitalism. Additionally, we present potential guidelines to enhance the interconnectedness of technology, universities, and society. Based on our findings, we suggest that universities can play a crucial role in bridging the societal-technological divide, but only if they undergo restructuring that fosters the strong version of cross-disciplinary knowledge and robust multidisciplinary thinking in professional training and research.

AB  - This study aimed to systematically review the literature focusing on music integration approaches adopted in preschool to secondary education in Turkey. The relevant studies were identified through a systematic search on five databases (The National Thesis Center, T√úBITAK ULAKBIM TR Index, ERIC, Scopus, and Web of Science). The paper analyzed the publications that were written in Turkish and English between 2010 and 2022 and that are available on the databases of empirical theses and peer-reviewed scientific journals, addressing music integration approaches adopted in preschool to secondary schools by using qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods. By operationalizing these criteria, 35 studies were included in the review. The studies included were found to tend to use quantitative methods. Music has mainly been integrated into math, science, and language arts curricula. This study revealed that most of the analyzed studies used a subservient integration style, an arts integration style, and offered limited insight into the depth and scope of subject areas covered and the sequencing of skills. Furthermore, this study proposed to consider educational, cognitive, artistic, and affective outcomes together by maintaining the integrity of each of the disciplines in music integration studies in the general schooling context.

AB  - The study was conducted as a case study to enhance pre-service science teachers' readiness for integration, inquiry-based learning (IBL), the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), and the application of real-life examples during their teacher training courses. The objective of the research was to explore pre-service science teachers' perceptions of integrated teaching, inquiry learning, and the use of ICT in science education, drawing on their experiences in teacher training. It also aimed to examine potential differences in their viewpoints and the evolution of their perceptions over time. A questionnaire was developed to gather insights from 50 pre-service science teachers regarding their views on the integration of science subjects before and after their 2-year teacher training courses. The collected data were analyzed using a qualitative approach with the QCAmap software, followed by a quantitative analysis utilizing the Microsoft Excel software. The findings revealed significant variances in perceptions among pre-service teachers based on the number of science subjects they studied during their training. Those who studied two or more subjects placed greater emphasis on the value of integration, IBL, ICT use, and real-life examples in science education, and exhibited more significant changes in their views throughout the 2 years of teacher training. Furthermore, the study found that nearly half of the pre-service teachers did not view IBL in science classes as crucial, and only about a quarter recognized the importance of ICT utilization.

AB  - This paper describes an interdisciplinary investigation of students' usage of ideas about energy from physics in the context of introductory chemistry. We focus on student understanding of the idea that potential energy is a function of distance between interacting objects, a concept relevant to understanding potential energy in both physical and chemical contexts. Data from student responses to written surveys and focus-group interviews reveal that students do not spontaneously make connections between ideas they have about energy from physics classes and the understanding of energy that they develop in chemistry. We describe the development of a sequence of questions that appears to aid students in drawing these connections appropriately. We also document students' as they are confronted with and struggle to resolve the mismatch between their energy ideas from physics and chemistry.

AB  - The need for a revised curriculum within the life sciences has been well-established. One strategy to improve student preparation in the life sciences is to redesign introductory courses like biology, chemistry, and physics so that they better reflect their disciplinary interdependence. We describe a medically relevant, context-based approach to teaching second semester general chemistry that demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of biology and chemistry. Our innovative method provides a model in which disciplinary barriers are diminished early in the undergraduate science curriculum. The course is divided into three principle educational modules: 1) Fundamentals of General Chemistry, 2) Medical Approaches to Inflammation, and 3) Neuroscience as a connector of chemistry, biology, and psychology. We accurately anticipated that this modified approach to teaching general chemistry would enhance student interest in chemistry and bridge the perceived gaps between biology and chemistry. The course serves as a template for context-based, interdisciplinary teaching that lays the foundation needed to train 21st century scientists. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - The need that emerged in Development Studies to trespass across disciplinary boundaries is discussed. An interdisciplinary characterization of Human Sustainable Development is sketched. Some attempts at the University of the Republic in Uruguay to foster related work that connects sciences and natural sciences are briefly described. This work spans research, teaching, institutional building, and university reform. It has been affected by the difficulties of pursuing interdisciplinary work when the growth of knowledge promotes specialization and academic structures are shaped by disciplinary concerns. Nevertheless, emergent lessons from the experience reported here suggest that trespassing across disciplinary boundaries in Development Studies may contribute significantly to fostering interdisciplinarity.

AB  - Probeware (sensors combined with data-analysis software) is a well-established part of physics education. In engineering and technology, sensors are frequently paired with actuators--motors, heaters, buzzers, valves, color displays, medical dosing systems, and other devices that are activated by electrical signals to produce intentional physical change. This article describes how a 20-year project aimed at better integration of the STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) uses brief actuator activities in physics instruction. Math Machines "actionware" includes software and hardware that convert virtually any free-form, time-dependent algebraic function into the dynamic actions of a stepper motor, servo motor, or RGB (red, green, blue) color mixer. With wheels and a platform, the stepper motor becomes LACI, a programmable vehicle. Adding a low-power laser module turns the servo motor into a programmable Pointer. Adding a gear and platform can transform the Pointer into an earthquake simulator.

AB  - Numerous national initiatives call for interdisciplinary mathematics and science education, but few empirical studies have examined practical considerations for integrated instruction in high school settings. The purpose of this qualitative study was twofold. First, the study sought to describe how and to what extent teachers integrate mathematics and science curricula in their classrooms after having participated in an intervention to promote and support mathematics and science integration. Second, the study was intended to expand our understanding of the barriers to and factors that enable integrated approaches in high school classrooms. The theoretical component of this study builds on and adapts previous models of science and mathematics integration to introduce the Intradisciplinary, Cross-disciplinary, Multidisciplinary, Interdisciplinary (ICMI) framework for identifying and defining classroom integration strategies. Findings include a description of several distinct practices high school teachers related to integrated instruction as well as the trade-offs teachers considered when making decisions related to integrated curricula. The implications of the findings for researchers and practitioners are discussed. Finally, we propose the conceptualization of "interdisciplinary pedagogical content knowledge" in mathematics and science as an area of focus that will enable teachers to successfully move toward interdisciplinary instruction.

AB  - Purpose: Interior architecture is based on theoretical, practical, and practice-based knowledge associated with other design disciplines that form a multidisciplinary framework. The aim of this study is to evaluate the art, science, and technical competencies that form the basis of knowledge and skills for the students within interior architecture education in Turkey. The other discussion is to what extent the courses provided during education meet the basic learning outcomes and provide for the professionals as part of the multidisciplinary study. Research Methods: Courses included in educational programs are categorised under 'theoretical/ theoretic', 'artistic/aesthetic', and 'technical/ practical', and are taken as a basis in the study, and the ratios and quantitative response values are determined. Besides, the joint readings of the subject are obtained by the interviews conducted with professionals. Findings: In the research, the numerical data of the courses related to art and aesthetic values, and the courses aiming at the application by transferring technical knowledge are obtained. The theoretical course workload yielded higher values. For findings related to the basic competencies acquired by the professional interior architects, there is the problem with 'technical expression' and 'experience in practice' within education. Implications for Research and Practice: The discussion of the standardisation through the educational programs should be avoided with a flexible approach. The consistency will be ensured through training practices and collaborations aimed at professional practices. In the future, collaborations for professionalism and studies in education and practice will play a supporting role after the graduation of students.

AB  - This book contains the full text of papers and posters presented at the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2024), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (WIARS). Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2024 received 729 submissions, from more than 50 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. The conference accepted for presentation 284 submissions (39% acceptance rate). This is the Volume 1 of the book titled Education and New Developments 2024, that showcases the outcomes of dedicated research and developments undertaken by authors who are driven by their passion to enhance research methods that directly relate to teaching, learning, and the practical applications of education in the present day. Within its pages, you will find a diverse array of contributors and presenters who expand our perspectives by delving into various educational matters. This first volume focuses on the main areas of TEACHERS AND STUDENTS and TEACHING AND LEARNING.

AB  - Going beyond ceremony to meaningfully integrate the lived experiences and narratives of Blacks particularly African Americans in the science curriculum, requires pragmatic research methodologies. K-12 science curriculum development neither considered the needs of African Americans nor were developed with Blacks in mind. Many questions arise related to what might be considered important for Blacks to know and moreover, who should make this determination, and from whose perspectives. This research used a multifaceted approach that was interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary in content and methodology. Considerations were given to social, cultural, historical, political, cognitive, and scientific lenses. This particular study explored considerations that led to the creation of two kinds of multimedia products -- video clips and an animation. This research explores how the lived experiences and narratives of African American Gullah Geechee of the southern Coasts of the United States might be integrated into the science curriculum using video clips. This research also investigates the creation of a culturally representative animation to explicate considerations that were made when using the social, cultural, and historical underpinnings of Blacks in America. The research highlights the research methodologies and the meaning of representation, that have important implications for meaningful Black cultural representation in the science curriculum.

AB  - This study examines the exchange of citations between two disciplines -- Educational Technology (ET) and Library and Information Science (LIS) -- as an indication of their interdisciplinary impact. The study was conducted in three phases. The first phase consists of an analysis of citations from ET journals to 15 top LIS journals; the second phase examined citations from LIS journals to 15 top ET journals; the third phase studied the five LIS journals -- not on the original list of 15 -- to cite ET journals and the relationship of citations from ET journals to them. The findings of this study reveal that about 1/10 LIS articles and 1/30 ET articles in the study sample were cited at least once in an article from the other discipline. This suggests that LIS has slightly stronger impact on ET research than vice versa. Among specific journals, the Journal of Education for Library and Information Science and the Journal of Documentation in LIS and Educational Technology Research and Development and the Journal of Educational Technology and Society in ET were most cited in the other discipline. Overall, the findings indicate a fair amount of exchange of ideas between the disciplines of LIS and ET. These findings are significant for interdisciplinary researchers in both ET and LIS as an indication of the links between and impact of these disciplines.

AB  - Success in undergraduate biology courses relies upon a firm grounding in chemical principles. We sought to raise students' awareness of the connection between these two disciplines and to improve their understanding of each by carrying out a pilot project that integrated the curricula of Principles of Chemistry II (CHEM1212K) and Principles of Biology I (BIOL1107K) during the Fall 2016 semester. The study involved two course pairs: one section of each course delivered in the traditional non-integrated manner and a second pair of sections that were integrated across the chemistry and biology disciplines in both the scope and sequence of the content delivery. Both integrated and non-integrated sections were taught by the same instructors, who have expertise in both chemistry and biology to ensure a full understanding of both courses' content. Attitudinal surveys administered at the beginning and end of the semester showed that students in the integrated BIOL/CHEM section of our pilot study appreciated the delivery of an integrated curriculum and improved their awareness of the connections between the two disciplines. End-of-course assessments of topic mastery demonstrated improvements in the integrated students' capacity to understand and apply both biology and chemistry topics compared to students in the non-integrated sections.

AB  - A course entitled "Science and Engineering Education: Interdisciplinary Aspects" was designed to expose undergraduate students of science and engineering education to the attributes of interdisciplinary education which integrates science and engineering. The core of the course is an interdisciplinary lesson, which each student is supposed to teach his/her peers. Sixteen students at advanced stages of their studies attended the course. The research presented here used qualitative instruments to characterise students' attitudes towards interdisciplinary learning and teaching of science and engineering. According to the findings, despite the significant challenge which characterises interdisciplinary teaching, a notable improvement was evident throughout the course in the percentage of students who expressed willingness to teach interdisciplinary classes in future.

AB  - This study aims to reveal the bibliometric characteristics of publications on educational research from diverse perspectives, including the level of national-international collaborations, the percentage change in open-access papers, and interactions with other disciplines. Through bibliometric analysis, the data were collected from Web of Science (WoS), "Education and Educational Research (E&ER),""Psychology, Educational (PE),""Education, Special (ES)" and "Education Scientific Disciplines (ESD)" categories, during 2011 to 2020. The findings suggest that the number of publications in each category and the percentage of open-access publications have increased regularly. However, it was observed that categories, especially the ES category, were partially falling behind, as compared to the growth in WoS; while the ES and the PE categories were the highest regarding national-international collaborations over time. Both collaboration levels were the highest in the E&ER category. It was concluded that the multi-authorship trend has rapidly increased, the number of references has regularly increased, and specifically, the PE category has been distinguished from others in terms of the references used. Meanwhile, the change over time in the aggregate impact factor, calculated for each category as a measure of the widespread impact of the studies, pointed to inflation. The results show that educational research is becoming more organized and international, while less fragmented. Moreover, the findings support that educational research is interdisciplinary in essence and diverse in content.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to evaluate the potential of use for computer science course designs (CSCD) created by game-based learning method. Qualitative case study was used as the research design. CSCDs created for Minecraft Education Edition (MinecraftEdu) were examined in the context of various criteria by document analysis method, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with teachers actively using MinecraftEdu in their classes. The research revealed that the CSCDs created for MinecraftEdu primarily aimed at developing coding and design skills, underscored interdisciplinary collaboration, laid more emphasis on cognitive-psychomotor achievements with curriculum eligibility. It was acknowledged that introduction, body and conclusion parts have an elaborate design in majority of course designs according to Gagn√©'s Events of Instruction Model, and yet, more attention should be paid to gaining the learner's attention, stimulating recall of prior learning, giving feedback, and ensuring retention and transfer. Despite increasing interest and trend towards educational games and game-based learning environments, there are limited number of studies that can help teachers evaluate the games that can be most effective in their fields and different learning contexts. Therefore, it is anticipated that this study will contribute to the related literature on game-based course designs and applicability.

AB  - Implemented was a 45-minute per day Primary Science IDEAS intervention in grades 1-2 integrating reading and writing within science instruction in a multi-year study conducted in 8 experimental and 9 control schools. Results found a significant direct achievement effect in grades 1-2 on both the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) Science and Reading. In addition, the direct effect of the intervention in grades 1-2 also resulted in significant achievement transfer from grades 1-2 to grade 3 on both the ITBS Science and Reading. Discussed are policy implications of the findings for increasing instructional time allocated to science in grades 1-2 and expanding the focus of grade 1-2 student achievement assessment to include content-area learning.

AB  - Situated in the context of an in-service professional development (PD) program focused on Interdisciplinary Science Inquiry, this quantitative study tests the validity of and further explores the theoretical model adapted from Desimone's (2009), "Educational Researcher," 38, 181-199 conceptual framework on effectiveness of PD. The participants include 204 teachers and 5,581 students within 12 local public schools from 2012 to 2016. The multilevel models indicate that PD participation, school-, and teacher-level factors influence teacher pedagogical content knowledge and inquiry instruction in different ways. Furthermore, the inquiry instruction significantly relates student understanding of interdisciplinary science concepts (ISCs) through a few mediators. Therefore, this study reinforces calls to provide teachers with high quality PD and contributes to current knowledge base of the mechanisms of how inquiry instruction influences students' understanding of ISCs.

AB  - Teacher Education for Sustainable Development (TESD) is a niche innovation in teacher education that empowers teachers to prepare learners to address global socio-environmental challenges. To advance the diffusion of this niche innovation into general teacher education, this article offers a systematic literature review based on a qualitative analysis of 158 peer-reviewed publications on TESD research. Our results show that TESD research is a growing field characterized by five types of inquiry: designing learning environments, understanding learner attributes, measuring learning outcomes, promoting systems change, and advancing visions for the field. Major innovation potentials of TESD for more general teacher education are its emphasis on the grand socio-environmental challenges of our times, methodologies to engage with knowledge diversity (e.g., inter/transdisciplinarity), and sustainability science learning approaches (e.g., backcasting). We suggest that future work builds from this review to strengthen links between teacher education and TESD in enhancing quality education.

AB  - An interdisciplinary team of physics, education, math and chemistry faculty developed MATH-GAINS (Growing as Adaptive INstructors) creating an ecosystem where mathematics faculty persistently and sustainably apply active learning strategies in their teaching of calculus courses. As a result of implementation, MATH-GAINS proposed to positively affect the wide-spread adaptation of active learning strategies by department faculty as well as student learning, retention and graduation of over 900 students annually. The objective of this paper is to provide details on how the project was conceived and implemented; instruments, research methodologies and active learning strategies used; and examples of faculty projects and preliminary results of the study. Results of the study add to the growing body of knowledge of how research-based instructional strategies designed in other STEM disciplines work in math courses, as well as an understanding of the critical factors that influence math faculty's teaching practices.

AB  - Here we present a multidisciplinary educational unit intended for general, advanced placement, or international baccalaureate-level high school science, focused on the three-dimensional structure of proteins and their connection to function and disease. The lessons are designed within the framework of the Next Generation Science Standards to make learning more relevant to daily life, and to help high school students engage in and understand advanced topics beyond the typical high school chemistry or biology curriculum. The unit involves lectures, videos, a hands-on activity, a research paper, a laboratory experiment, and a culminating project. Students are introduced to protein crystallography, the protein data bank, and the computer program PyMOL (free download for educational use) to visualize protein structure in three dimensions. Clear improvements in student comprehension of protein structure and function have been documented after implementation of the unit.

AB  - Over many years of research, a decline in interest over the school years is repeatedly described. To address this decline, the value of content or a specific subject should be promoted. To increase content relevance, task value interventions can be conducted which are related to the theory of subjective task values by Wigfield & Eccles (2020). These values consist of intrinsic, attainment, and utility value. Due to its constructivist character, interdisciplinary interventions may meet preconditions to promote interest and could initiate situational interest and influence subject-specific values (e.g., utility value). The present study investigates whether and to what extent interdisciplinary interventions in biology and physical education influence the development of interest. A total of 73 students (mean age = 17.7 years) from four secondary schools took part in a one-day interdisciplinary intervention called "learning through movement," which combined physical education and biology. The intervention was accompanied by a modified quantitative questionnaire based on predescribed subjective task values. Mixed ANOVAs with repeated measures showed that the interdisciplinary intervention positively influenced situational intrinsic and utility values for both physical education and biology. By examining potential interaction effects, it was found that students with a low initial situational interest were positively affected by the intervention. Our study supports the notion that interdisciplinary interventions have an impact on subjective task values in biology and physical education and therefore have the potential to influence interest development, especially for lower interested students.

AB  - This article presents a project, Shapes of Water, funded by the Finnish Cultural Foundation, which gave music education students the opportunity to compose children's songs about climate change with the help of artists from two fields (contemporary circus and music) and a scientist (chemistry). The article outlines the ways in which the composing project challenged students' attitudes toward composing as a method for educating children about climate change, and brings together the experiences of the artists and scientist during the project. Finally, three focus areas are presented with recommendations for a sustainable eco-socially oriented approach to music education.

AB  - A perennial goal of science educators is to develop functional scientific literacy in their students, especially those who will not become professional scientists. This article provides an example of implementing a socioscientific issues approach in an undergraduate environmental science course that enables students to develop the knowledge, reasoning, and skills requisite for resolving complex issues in a sustainable manner for people and the environment now and in the future. This example incorporates an interdisciplinary approach by leveraging traditional laboratory investigations and information from outside of science proper to facilitate a deeper and more nuanced understanding of gray wolves returning to Northern California.

AB  - Highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of research, we present a series of experiments for undergraduate lab courses that teach the principles of preparative ion exchange chromatography and flame emission spectroscopy. Through these inquiry-based experiments, the students learn about experimental design and instrument limitations, naturally connecting general chemistry principles with analytical and physical chemistry and materials science. The goal is to devise experimental parameters that allow quantitative ion exchange on a small scale, and to monitor the exchange with optical spectroscopy. The small-footprint, inexpensive flame emission spectroscopy setup we developed can be used to accurately determine relative concentrations of alkali metal ions in a sample, while also being suitable for simpler experiments, which allow it to be employed in a variety of classes. In a demonstration for energy research, we then perform the presented experiments on redox flow battery electrolytes to investigate the influence of the cation choice on battery performance.

AB  - This article describes a nuclear chemistry unit on the Manhattan Project, a research effort that led to the development of the world's first nuclear weapons during World War II. The unit is appropriate for an introductory high school chemistry or physics course and takes from four to six weeks. The unit poses this essential question: "Over the past 300 years, how have discoveries in science led to the development of nuclear energy and bombs?" Addressing this question, students synthesize knowledge of nuclear chemistry, learn how the scientific community came to construct and understand this knowledge, and understand how this knowledge has transformed society. Students learn and practice writing nuclear decay reactions and build toward a conceptual understanding of the pertinent "Next Generation Science Standards" (NGSS Lead States 2013) performance expectations.

AB  - Environmental forensics is the application of knowledge from geosciences and chemistry in a legal setting, e.g., to determine the origin and consequences of contamination events. Teaching environmental forensics requires reactivating prior knowledge from different fields of natural sciences, filling knowledge gaps, and connecting pieces of scientific evidence to form logical chains of arguments. Here, we present a cooperative teaching format that successfully covers the challenges of interdisciplinary teaching while further developing learners' soft skills. Through role-playing in a mock trial of a famous hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] contamination case in California, learners choose to team with the town of Hinkley, as the plaintiff team, or with Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), the company accused of the contamination, as the defense team. After introductory sessions, the teams summarize facts, and build and present arguments to support their claims regarding the formation of the Cr(VI) plume, the impact on the population's health, and remediation efforts taken by PG&E. These arguments are delivered in front of their peers and instructors, acting as judges, in a mock trial. Here, we summarize different modalities that have been tested over the past 10 years regarding role assignment and team building. This teaching format has been shown to be successful in engaging learners with the scientific aspects of the case-based trial while helping them become critical about information they are confronted with, delivering arguments in structured ways, defending their points of view, and improving communication skills on a peer- and layperson-level.

AB  - There is a gap between the importance of certain archeological material sources and their perception, both by professionals and by the general public. Textiles, for example, are essential to understanding practices that marked daily life and rituals in the past, but they have often been extremely degraded over time, particularly in temperate climates. As a result, museums often choose not to display this material to the public. Research teams themselves find it difficult to work with such altered and fragmentary materials. Design could provide new means of visualization and presentation and contribute to the intelligibility of these finds. However, the development of suitable media by designers requires a good understanding of the underlying physico-chemistry. Here we describe an interdisciplinary teaching initiative based on a doctoral project, the Archaeological Textile project studio, which we ran with design students. The studio was supervised by an educator team consisting of two chemists and two professional designers, with the participation of external scientists from research and cultural institutions. Seventeen projects were developed by 23 students from the first to the fourth academic year (L1 to M1). We discuss this initiative from the point of view of chemical education, as an original example of training higher education students who are not chemists using a project-based approach.

AB  - Water is one of Earth's fundamental natural systems. It is crucial to foster water literacy in today's global citizens, particularly through formal education. The purpose of this research, in parallel with a study focused on human dimensions of water systems (Mostacedo-Marasovic et¬†al., in press), is to examine water-related K-12 standards for teaching and learning about water and natural systems and develop a comprehensive and transdisciplinary perspective on water education. Our overarching question is, "What do disciplinary standards specify as outcomes for students' learning about water and natural systems?" Our research questions are: (1) "To what extent do these water-related standards address recognized domains of learning?" and (2) "What thematic outcomes for students' learning are apparent across grades in these water-related standards?." We use chi-square statistics and conventional qualitative content analysis complemented by processes from grounded theory to analyze water-related education standards (N = 196) from 11 education-oriented governmental and non-governmental organizations based in the United States and the United Nations. Our results indicate that, first, water-related standards emphasize the cognitive domain, including declarative and procedural knowledge, for water-related concepts and skills. The affective domain and its social component are far less prevalent. Second, the water-related standards illustrate four categories including abundance, distribution, and movement of water on Earth; water and the Geosphere; water and climate; and water and life. These findings provide a more comprehensive perspective from multiple disciplines of the natural sciences on outcomes for teaching and learning about water and natural systems, as well as the learning domains they address. These can inform educational efforts to cultivate water literacy across K-12 through teaching and learning.

AB  - This research is a qualitative study that examines the practices of teachers of science, mathematics, Turkish and social studies regarding interdisciplinary teaching approach. Participants in the study consisted of 35 teachers working in three different secondary schools with different socioeconomic backgrounds in the province of Adana in the academic year of 2016-2017. The data were collected by interviewing the participants through the "Demographic Characteristics Form" and "Interdisciplinary Teaching Practice Evaluation Form" developed by the researcher and analyzed by content analysis method. The results showed that the secondary school teachers performed the interdisciplinary teaching practices and that they influenced by the course goals and contents, information about different courses, characteristics of different students and extra goals. Interdisciplinary teaching practices are important in terms of promoting effective learning, having mental and emotional goals, and providing quality education services. It was revealed that both science and social sciences can be related to each other and to art lessons in the teaching process and the students are positively affected by the interdisciplinary teaching process. It was also found that teachers need guidance, adequate knowledge and skills, cooperation, and instructional designs or plans to guide them for practice.

AB  - This article sheds new light on Karl Marx's theoretical legacy to promote educational philosophy and theory in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education. Accordingly, this article selects Marxian thought as an exemplar case to elaborate critical pedagogy and aesthetics and culminate with an overview of the Marxian approach to the theoretical underpinnings of STEAM education. Hence, the article critically reviews Marx's original works and earlier Marxian scholars' contributions to extending critical pedagogy and its applications to the STEAM paradigm and informational and communication technology (ICT) development. This article critiques notable structural problems of STEAM education that produce power differentials such as educational gaps and digital divides in the current age of digital capitalism. Given the context, this article refines art and communication theories through the lens of his biography and writings. Additionally, this article incorporates the Marxian viewpoints about reproduction and aesthetic literacy into STEAM education. Overall, this article reviews the theoretical legacy of Marx and his essential critical and pedagogical theory, calling on scholars to pay close attention to re-orienting STEAM pedagogy as an emerging multidisciplinary field.

AB  - Numerous studies have shown that teaching the history and philosophy of science (POS) can help improve senior high school students' scientific literacy. The history of science is usually taught in school science lessons by reference to particular cases, experiments, and scientists. In contrast, the POS -- that is, the study of general and fundamental questions regarding the nature of science (NOS) -- is often embedded within lessons, is considered difficult to teach, and is sometimes hidden from students. This research analyses the overlap between the conceptualisations of the NOS and the POS. The paper also reports on a study that used "explicit" pedagogical methods to teach topics related to the POS to Chinese senior high school students. The empirical results, which are supported by a theoretical framework that adopts the family resemblance approach to the NOS, show that students who participated in this POS course significantly improved their scientific literacy and their understanding of the relationships among science, technology, and society. The POS topics in this course helped students better understand the cognitive-epistemic system in the NOS. The findings of this small-scale study have broader implications for the way in which the POS is taught in high school education.

AB  - This article presents a synopsis of an interdisciplinary literacy-science, cross-country, fully remote service-learning (S-L) project prompted by and executed during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The article shares discussions, analyses, and evaluations from both community partners (staff of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences at Whiteville) and university faculty (education studies professors from Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas) to highlight how the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic created unique opportunities for S-L. With summary of the S-L partnership's fully online development and comparisons to other, more traditional S-L projects completed pre-COVID-19, we offer readers logistical tips for navigating their own virtual S-L partnerships. The article concludes with student learning outcomes from pre- and postproject reflections and identification of interdisciplinary work benefits from both the professors and community partners.

AB  - Training in chemistry is essential for undergraduate medical students; however, at the National University of Colombia, basic chemistry courses are associated with high fail rates and low academic performance with regard to first semester students, especially in vulnerable special admission populations. A longitudinal study was carried out via program evaluation methodology using quantitative and qualitative techniques to assess an innovative pedagogical strategy founded on context-based learning and different didactic and evaluative strategies employing information and communication technologies (ICT), which was tested on students of medicine by an interdisciplinary team of teachers in a new course. With the pedagogical strategy, a statistically significant improvement was observed in the academic performance of the students, with an increase in the mean grades that went from 3.61/5.00 to 3.95/5.00, a decrease of the fail rate from 15.50% to 3.48%, and the development of useful chemistry knowledge for the students during their training and for their professional lives. Furthermore, the study became an opportunity for collaborative learning among colleagues, favoring ongoing training of teaching staff and pedagogical innovation in professional learning communities.

AB  - In earlier studies, it has been argued that drama has the potential to stimulate learning in science. However, it is not widely used, one reason being that science teachers are not familiar with this instructional strategy. In this study, it was investigated how pre-service teachers in science developed dramas related to content in a biology course. The research question included how the pre-service teachers reflected on drama as an instructional strategy to stimulate conceptual understanding about cells and cell processes, both for themselves and for their future students. Ten pre-service teachers participated, all in their first year of studies to become teachers at secondary school. Data were collected in the form of student reports and video-recordings, showing the dramas they had created served as complements confirming the reports. The reports were analysed based on the tool Content Representations. The results showed that despite the fact that the pre-service teachers previously had never experienced drama in their science education, and that they identified critical aspects of using drama in science, they were positive about using drama in science education. Some of the pre-service teachers also argued that the use of drama helped them in their own understanding of cell processes.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the perceptions of classroom teacher candidates towards the concept and teaching of social sciences through metaphors. In the 2018-2019 academic year, the Department of primary education of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Lefke European University, Faculty of Education 1., 2., 3. and 4. there are 119 candidates of teachers who study in the classroom. Phenomenology design, one of the qualitative research methods, was used in the study. The data of the study was obtained through a semi-structured interview form. Content analysis technique was used in the analysis of the data. In this context, he produced 61 metaphors aimed at the concept of social sciences by participants. The metaphors produced were collected under 4 different conceptual categories. The metaphors produced by the class teacher candidates for the concept of social sciences were collected in 4 categories, "social-vital, interdisciplinary, cultural resource and primary education" respectively. The number of metaphors (f=27) in the "social-vital" category is greater when the metaphors developed by the teacher candidates according to the categories created for the concept of social sciences are taken into account. The most repeated in this category has been the metaphor of life (f=20). The classroom teacher candidates produced 69 metaphors for teaching social sciences. The metaphors developed for the teaching of social sciences in line with the explanations made by the participants were grouped into 4 categories: "meeting social needs, interdisciplinary, knowledge transfer, cultural transfer," "When the metaphors developed by the teacher candidates according to the categories are taken into consideration, it is observed that the number of metaphors (f=31) in the "meeting the social needs" category for social sciences teaching is higher. The most repeated teaching of values in this category has been the metaphor (f=8).

AB  - The objective of this article is to discuss the development of statistical and probabilistic reasoning in childhood as a result of an interdisciplinary project, involving the fields of mathematics, statistics, and life sciences. This is a case study with three 10-year-old students from a Brazilian school. The children's oral and written narratives are used as a methodological path. It is an investigation process that examines human actions and considers social practices, subjective experience, identity, beliefs, emotions, values, context, and complexity. The results show that an interdisciplinary study involving life sciences, mathematics and statistics promoted the development of statistical and probabilistic reasoning, appropriate to the age group, enabling the children to positively rescale their eating habits.

AB  - Science educators have highlighted the need to develop students to integrate knowledge across science disciplines to address real-world issues. However, there has been little research about the development of interdisciplinary assessment instruments. In this research, the instrument that measures the level of upper-secondary school students' interdisciplinary understanding of environmental issues was developed and validated based upon Wilson's Construct Modeling framework. After a pilot testing, the revised assessment instrument of interdisciplinary understanding covering five typical environmental problems comprised 14 multiple-choice questions and four constructed-response questions. Five hundred twenty-three eleventh graders, including 279 boys and 244 girls from mainland China, made up the research sample. The partial credit Rasch analysis has verified the reliability and validity of the interdisciplinary understanding instrument. In addition, the results of cluster analysis revealed that over half of the students could use some partially accurate scientific concepts and principles from two or more disciplinary perspectives to deal with a specific environmental issue. The validated instrument can provide insights for assessing and developing upper-secondary school students' interdisciplinary understanding in science education.

AB  - Scholars assert that, worldwide, doctoral provision is increasingly characterised by accelerated scales of production, competitive funding, centralised administration, and interdisciplinary, cohort-based training. The situation in the UK appears to mirror this picture but scholars have long noted that national settings mediate the forms that broader trends take. We therefore examined the case of the UK's social science doctorates, which have seen both marked growth and a range of policy changes, to explore the potential extent of alignment with these trends. Invoking institutional isomorphism, a conceptual framework which asserts how convergence can be driven by different factors, we interviewed senior staff at a range of UK HEIs to examine the activities and underlying rationales behind their social science doctoral provision. We were able to establish that, while there is a degree of isomorphism around their social science doctorates, this is a complex and uneven situation because different kinds of HEIs are subject to a varying combination of simultaneous and often conflicting forces. Our analysis highlights not only how the relationship between national policies and higher education culture can be fraught, but also how organisations' individual positioning and history has implications for how they are able to act in policy contexts.

AB  - This paper, the second in a series of three, explores the representation of Earth System Science (ESS) in the Australian Curriculum (ACARA, 2018a)) through the Cross Curriculum Priority area of Sustainability and the Australian Curriculum: Science (F-12), with a focus on F-10. Part I (in Teaching Science, 68.1) overviewed the current understandings of the Earth System and the relatively recent interdisciplinary field of Earth System Science (ESS). Here, in Part II, an analysis of the Cross Curriculum Priority area of Sustainability and the Australian Curriculum: Science (F-12) revealed that several key ESS understandings and system-thinking skills were present. How the most current ESS understandings and abilities could lead to a far deeper understanding of the Earth System are then considered and those that may need more attention from students and teachers are highlighted. Part III (in a forthcoming issue) outlines several research-informed pedagogies to help learners develop more scientific understandings of the Earth System, and appropriate related abilities. These Earth System goals and pedagogies needed to be considered in the ACARA review of the Australian Curriculum: Science and the Sustainability Cross Curriculum Priority area -- to that end, this paper was submitted to the appropriate committees. We believe the suggested ESS additions and emphases could comprise one pathway toward a more comprehensive and confident Earth System literacy and a stronger engagement in the Earth and other sciences at every school level, and to the curriculum as a whole. Better-informed, sustainability decision-making and actions by students as today's, and tomorrow's, citizens is the hoped-for outcome. [For Part I, see EJ1346071.]

AB  - This is an exciting time to be a biologist. The advances in our field and the many opportunities to expand our horizons through interaction with other disciplines are intellectually stimulating. This is as true for people tasked with helping the field move forward through support of research and education projects that serve the nation's needs as for those carrying out that research and educating the next generation of biologists. So, it is a pleasure to contribute to this edition of "CBE--Life Sciences Education". This column will cover three aspects of the interactions of physics and biology as seen from the viewpoint of four members of the Division of Undergraduate Education of the National Science Foundation. The first section places the material to follow in context. The second reviews some of the many interdisciplinary physics-biology projects we support. The third highlights mechanisms available for supporting new physics-biology undergraduate education projects based on ideas that arise, focusing on those needing and warranting outside support to come to fruition.

AB  - Climate change (CC) is the most significant global issue facing humanity, yet research addressing the perspectives of the key players influential in developing and implementing school-based CC curricula at a cross-country national level is scarce. This study examined the perceptions of policymakers, teacher professional development providers and CCE teachers in relation to: CC knowledge, representation in the curriculum, content and pedagogy, and support for teaching. The voices of these educators were gathered across five countries (Australia, England, Finland, Indonesia, and Israel) through semi-structured interviews. Analysis revealed much commonality across the countries and across role types. Although participants agreed that CCE is multidisciplinary and expressed widespread support for including CC in the curriculum through a cross-curriculum approach, their conceptualisations of CC knowledge were inconsistent. Participants recognised the importance of a science basis in CCE, and of student action, with some participants also emphasising emotional, ethical and value-based inclusions. Most suggested active learning focused pedagogies. Variations in approaches to CC implementation between countries suggest that CCE is in a transitional phase. In all five countries, the interviewees called for the curriculum to make more explicit connections to CC and for governmental leadership in supporting CCE, professional development and provision of resources.

AB  - We currently live in a high-tech society where portable supercomputers, artificial intelligence, genetic enhancement, etc., are becoming part of our daily life. It can be argued that this steady flow of complex technology is vigorously pushing aside religion and faith in God. Nowadays if a student decides to study physics he/she cannot possibly think of, nor have an interest in philosophy, let alone theology. This limited attitude towards physics is stripping it of its real meaning and purpose. This paper argues that physics is a study that God has put in the hands of humanity to be used in conjunction with philosophy and theology, in order not only to be able to ask "big questions" about nature and the universe, but also to actively contribute to finding some answers to them. Ideas about a scientific-philosophical-theological approach to teaching physics at the undergraduate level within a Catholic institution are presented and discussed.
