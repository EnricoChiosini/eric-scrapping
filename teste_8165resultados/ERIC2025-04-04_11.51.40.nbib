AB  - Fluorescence and phosphorescence are two forms of photoluminescence used in modern research and in practical applications. The early observations of these phenomena, before the emergence of quantum theory, highlight the investigation into the mechanism of light emission. In contrast to incandescence, photoluminescence does not require high temperatures and does not usually produce noticeable heat. Such a "cold light" was the object of an interesting controversy in the 19th century: does it fit into thermodynamics? The early applications, such as the fluorescent tube, fluorescence analysis, and fluorescent tracers, are described. (Contains 13 figures and 4 notes.)

AB  - In this article, the author shares her memories of Sally Smith, the founder of The Lab School of Washington, where she works as the director of the Occupational Therapy. When the author first met Smith, Smith asked her what brought her to The Lab School at that point in her career. She told Smith that her background was rather eclectic, since she had worked for many years in jobs not directly connected with Occupational Therapy. She later realized that it was the richness of having faculty with a broad variety of life experiences that she particularly liked. However, a very sad time for the Lab School family was the passing its fearless leader, yet it was also a learning time as well. At a personal level, the author still hears Smith in her mind saying that the priority must be the children, that learning that is fun will stick with a teacher longer, and finally she hears her challenge her thinking with, "Why not?" The author likes to think Smith would be pleased to see that everyone still feels her presence around every corner and that everyone remains up to the challenge of meeting her creative expectations for the futures of the students.

AB  - Young-earth creationism has undergone a shift in emphasis toward building of historical models that incorporate Biblical and scientific evidence and the acceptance of scientific conclusions that were formerly rejected. The RATE Group admitted that massive amounts of radioactive decay occurred during earth history but proposed a period of accelerated decay during Noah's Flood to fit the resulting history into a young-earth timeframe. Finding a mechanism for the acceleration and dealing with the excessive heat and radiation it would generate posed major problems for the project. Catastrophic plate tectonics was proposed to explain continental movements in a short timeframe and serve as a trigger for Noah's Flood, but other creationists rejected the idea citing hopeless chronological problems. Creationists have also sought to explain the order of the fossil record and the Ice Age in a young-earth timeframe. An examination of these efforts demonstrates the anti-scientific nature of using the Bible as a non-negotiable framework for earth history.

AB  - Children (10 or 11 years old) with and without developmental coordination disorder (DCD) were exposed to imposed optic flow in a moving room. We manipulated the amplitude and frequency of oscillatory room motion, and we evaluated the coupling of standing body sway with room oscillations. The results revealed that standing sway of both children with and without DCD was influenced by room motion. However, children with DCD responded differently than children without DCD to specific combinations of room motion amplitude and frequency. We conclude that DCD can influence a child's use of imposed optic flow for postural control and that these effects are situation-specific rather than being systemic.

AB  - The author outlines ways in which conceptions of texts and literacy may be distinctive across academic disciplines. Framed in theories of social semiotics, she asserts that each discipline is recreated through a series of texts, defined broadly to include any instances of communication. Texts in each content area not only instantiate a particular body of content, but also instantiate social practices and roles in relation to that content. After outlining how content and social roles may vary according to each discipline, the author concludes that content area literacy instruction can include encouraging students to recognize and reflect on these differences in texts and the practices surrounding them, thereby helping students to develop metadiscursive frameworks for navigating content area literacies.

AB  - This study aimed to identify salient problem characteristics perceived by students in problem-based curricula. To this end, reflective essays from biomedical students (N = 34) on characteristics of good problems were text-analyzed. Students identified eleven characteristics, of which they found the extent to which the problem leads to desired learning outcomes as the most important characteristic. The extent to which the problem stimulates elaboration and the extent to which the problem promotes team effort were considered to be the least important problem characteristics. We clustered the eleven characteristics into two categories, "features" or "functions," based on the perceived roles of the characteristics. Identification and clustering of the eleven characteristics provide a useful basis for future problem design and evaluation. Problems are considered to be one of the three key elements of problem-based learning (PBL); the other elements are students and tutors (Majoor, Schmidt, Snellen-Balendong, Moust, & Stalenhoef-Halling, 1990). Problems in PBL refer to the instructional materials presented to students to trigger their learning processes. Problems are often presented in text format, sometimes with pictures and computer simulations. They typically describe situations or phenomena set in real-life contexts, which require students to explain or resolve the presenting issues (Hmelo-Silver, 2004). The current study aimed to understand which characteristics of problems are perceived by students to be associated with good problems. While it is possible that students and problem designers may value different aspects of problems, understanding the students' perceptions will allow us to gain an insight into what motivates or helps the students to learn so that we can incorporate these characteristics in future problems to determine if students' perceptions of good problems are useful in designing problems.

AB  - Childhood research has long shared a bio-political terrain with state agencies in which children figure primarily as "human futures". In the 20th century bio-social dualism helped to make that terrain navigable by researchers, but, as life processes increasingly become key sites of bio-political action, bio-social dualism is becoming less useful as a navigational aid. The contribution that a view of childhood as a "hybrid" phenomenon might make to developing new navigational aids is considered. A Foucaultian reading of the history of childhood bio-politics yields three "multiplicities" of childhood. The assistance these can offer in navigating the contemporary biopolitics of childhood is described.

AB  - To broaden participation in computing we need to look beyond traditional domains of inquiry and expertise. We present results from a demonstration project in which interactive journalism was used to infuse computational thinking into the standard curriculum and regular classroom experience at a middle school with a diverse population. Outcomes indicate that we were able to develop positive attitudes about computational thinking and programming among students and teachers who did not necessarily view themselves as "math types." By partnering with language arts, technology and math teachers at Fisher Middle School, Ewing New Jersey, we introduced the isomorphism between the journalistic process and computational thinking to 7th and 8th graders. An intense summer institute, first with the teachers and then with students recruited from the school, immersed them in the "newsroom of the future" where they researched and wrote news stories, shot and edited video, and developed procedural animations in Scratch to support their storylines. An afterschool club sustained the experience. The teachers adapted interactive journalism and Scratch programming to enrich standard language arts curriculum and are infusing computational thinking in classroom experiences throughout the school.

AB  - This inquiry-based lesson was inspired by Denise Fleming's book entitled, "In the Tall, Tall Grass" (1991). The author used the book and a real study of prairie grasses to teach kindergartners how to make careful observations and record what they see. In addition, they learn how to "draw as scientists." Here the author describes her class's yearly journey into the "tall, tall grass." (Contains 3 resources.)

AB  - Many web 2.0 sites are extremely popular and contain vast amounts of content, but how much of this content is useful in academia? This exploratory paper investigates the potential use of the popular web 2.0 image site Flickr as an academic image resource. The study identified images tagged with any one of 12 subject names derived from recognized academic subject categories in the three main Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) citation indexes. Image content analysis was used to determine the types of images found, and term-frequency analysis of associated tags was carried out to provide additional insights into the context behind image placement. The results show that Flickr can be used as a resource for subject-specific images in some subject areas; and that non subject-specific images can also prove to be of value for individual academics.

AB  - There is an increasing call for curricula in health care to facilitate interprofessional client-centred evidence-based decision making through a reflective and reflexive framework. This discussion paper proposes that adoption of the World Health Organisation, International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as a framework for curricula of health professionals promotes the necessary paradigm shift needed to legitimise a broad evidence base as the foundation of interprofessional dialogue. Client function is seen as the product of an open system incorporating the individual, social and environmental influences on behaviour, with the role of the professional being to acknowledge the context of individual behaviour through an understanding of individual's functioning in their environment. It is concluded that client focused practice and an iterative process of clinical reasoning based on a broad evidence base that conceptualises health care as the maintenance and promotion of health across the lifespan requires a re-conceptualising of health. The emerging concept shifts the primary emphasis of health care away from post-diagnosis tertiary care towards clients who maintain a life-long independence in the community.

AB  - Using mini-aquaria experiments, a learning unit on the effects of light period on aquatic ecosystems was developed for 7th grade students. This guided inquiry unit was aimed at helping students understand basic ecological principles involved in relationships among physical, chemical, and biological components in aquatic ecosystems. It involved asking guiding questions to direct students' investigations and experimental designs, providing experimental data for analysis and interpretation, and facilitating students' construction of explanations. The students' achievements were assessed through a questionnaire, written documents, interviews, and classroom observation. In this study, students were encouraged to ask questions throughout the learning sequence, in which they did ask more intelligent questions, generate fruitful ideas, and finally develop their own understanding. Students gradually accumulated conceptual understanding through the designed learning activities, and both students and teachers had a positive attitude toward the learning unit. The minimum and maximum values of the students' perceptions on the learning unit were found to be 4.14 and 4.65 (on a 5-point scale). The mean and standard deviation of the 15 items on perception were 4.41 and 0.41, indicating a moderate level of approval. One advantage of this learning unit is in its low cost for implementation while producing effective learning activities, especially in schools with budgetary and time constraints. This study should inspire teachers to adapt and adopt the proposed activities to enhance students' understanding of the ecosystems. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - This study examines how student learning can be enhanced by using a multi-course project that simulates an industry environment and emphasizes the interrelationship among course concepts through collaborative efforts of student teams. The role of technology as a tool in facilitating student teamwork is examined. The researchers found that students who appreciated and understood the importance of technology and the collaborative nature of the multi-course project had a more positive overall response to the multi-course project. Implications of the study's multi-course project as well as instructional tips for conducting multi-course projects embedded with technology are discussed. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - Abduction is a method of reasoning that people use under uncertainty in a context in order to come up with new ideas. The use of abduction in this exploratory study is twofold: (i) abduction is a cross-disciplinary analytic tool that can be used to explain certain key aspects of human-computer interaction in advanced Information Society Technology (IST) environments; (ii) abduction is probably the central inferential mechanism at work when learners learn or in general make sense of things in an IST or mobile context. Consequently, abduction illuminates the special epistemological circumstances of IST enhanced learning, in particular when the learning materials and the learning environment have been arranged in accordance with constructivist pedagogical guidelines. A study of abductive reasoning will help us better understand IST enhanced learning and IST user behaviour as well as give us some valuable hints to the design of human-computer interaction in general.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether there was a quantifiable improvement in learning outcomes by integrating course materials in a 4-year baccalaureate program, utilizing a knowledge repository with a conceptual map that spans a discipline. Two new models were developed to provide the framework for this knowledge repository. A design artifact, Constructivist Unifying Baccalaureate Epistemology (CUBE), was developed and tested and incorporates these models. This CUBE artifact incorporates a Semantic Web ontology and a W3C Resource Description Framework to create a concept space that offers a unified view of the discipline. The Knowledge Repository was modeled as an organic structure with the ability to evolve over time by incorporating a ranking/voting feature which enables students and faculty to add content to the knowledge base and collectively evaluate the relative weights of conceptual threads. Conceptual Clustering was used to create a concept map for traversing the Knowledge Repository. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the Knowledge Repository, a triangulated research approach was used, which cross checked results with multiple data sources and utilized qualitative and quantitative methods to validate the test instruments. The analyses included: focus groups, semistructured interviews, a questionnaire, and a quantitative exam that measured knowledge spanning multiple courses. Four classes participated during two semesters with four faculty members, using control and treatment groups. The research contrasted conventional single course instruction "versus" an Integrated Knowledge Repository (IKR) approach to learning. There was an average increase of 25 points in scores on a comprehensive exam for students who used the Knowledge Repository. The results supported our main hypothesis, that "Students utilizing the IKR will develop a more complex understanding of the interconnected nature of the materials linking a discipline than those students who take conventional single topic courses".

AB  - Frame analysis was used to examine how competing stakeholders framed a sixth grade curriculum controversy over whether the WWII internment of Japanese Americans should be categorized as a controversial issue. Teachers and administrators in a northwestern U.S. school claimed that the internment was clearly wrong and not controversial, but these claims were challenged by a small group of activists. Three data sets were analyzed: 11 semi-structured interviews, 40 public documents, and curriculum materials. Although activists could not change the school's claims, they were able to change the curriculum. Findings illustrate the ways that stakeholders in social studies curriculum controversies negotiate whether an issue should be categorized as controversial. Categorizations were dynamic and contingent on historical, contemporary, and ideological contexts. (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - The Randomized Control Trials (RCT) design and its quasi-experimental kissing cousin, the Comparison Group Trials (CGT), are golden to some and not even silver to others. At the center of the affection, at the vortex of the discomfort, are beliefs about what it takes to establish causality. These designs are considered primarily when the purpose of the evaluation is establishing whether there are outcomes associated with a program and, if so, how confidently the results can be attributed to the program. This article focuses on one after-assignment condition that may notably affect the logic of the RCT and the CGT designs, particularly the central assumption that, all other things being equal, observed differences if any between experimental (E, treatment) and nonexperimental (C, control, comparison) groups are attributable to the treatment. The concern might be characterized as augmentation of the control and experimental groups with relevant non-program services in non-random, potentially biasing, ways. Somewhat more attention is given to the experiences of the C group because of this group's particular significance for the logic of the RCT. Three key points are made: (1) In human service programs, the C groups are likely to be active, rather than passive. Ditto the E groups; (2) It matters if the groups are active, because this can lead to non-random augmentation of services particularly for the Cs but also the Es; and (3) Since the best assumption for human service programs may be an active C group, the evaluator, like Hamlet, should take arms against this sea of troubles both prospectively and retrospectively. In examining the national Head Start evaluation, whose next report of its evaluation, presenting the children's prowess in the first grade, is expected in 2007, this article states that the evaluation may represent the high water mark for an RCT in the context of a mature, widely available national program. It also states that the policy space regarding preschool programs for low-income children made the RCT design an inappropriate application to begin with. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Our knowledge "system" is built up from disciplines and specialties as its components, which are "wired" by patterns of collaboration that constitute its organization. The intellectual autonomy of these components prevents this knowledge system from adequately accounting for what we have gradually discovered during the past 50 years: In human life, society, and the biosphere, everything is related to everything else. It has also created a dual mode of knowing and doing, one embedded in experience and culture and the other separated from them. It is becoming increasingly evident that the lacunae in our knowledge system are directly related to the challenges faced by our civilization. This article outlines a proposal to begin delimiting these lacunae by inserting new components on the basis of roundtables into the knowledge system.

AB  - What is the likelihood of controlling technology by means of the law? In traditional societies, the law was deeply embedded in, and dependent on, culture (the totality of human creations for making sense of and living in the world). Industrialization required a complete restructuring of both technology and society, thus engulfing all traditions in a flood of new situations for which there were no precedents. This necessitated a growing reliance on reason at the expense of culture, thereby creating a rational and technical order that evolved with less and less reference to sense (i.e. experience and culture). It is within this context that recent legal transformations must be understood as participating in an order of non-sense. This bodes ill for protecting and helping to ensure a livable, sustainable human future. (Contains 2 notes.)

AB  - This article presents the authors' response to the commentaries on their article. They focus on two important issues raised by most of the reviewers: (a) the curricular dependence of the proposed learning progression and the daunting (twin) challenges of bringing about changes in curriculum and assessment and consolidating and validating the proposed learning progression; and (b) the need for further research and development of a wide variety of sorts. The authors agree that these are major challenges but see them as opportunities as well: opportunities to use research on children's learning to inform curriculum and assessment much more than is currently the case. They argue that although some specific aspects of learning progressions will depend on specific aspects of curricula, which are themselves perhaps a matter of choice and preference, both learning progressions and good curricula are strongly constrained by cognitive and epistemological factors as well. Hence, at a coarse-grained level, there may be fewer truly different paths than might be initially supposed and some general steps in a progression on which all would agree. The authors conclude by underscoring the hypothetical (conjectural) nature of the proposed learning progression, the limitations of the research base that informs it, and the need to do more work that addresses the larger problem of how learning cumulates over a broad sweep of 6 to 8 years.

AB  - Adult workplace intervention programs to improve physical activity through wearing personal pedometers and completing team orientated "virtual journeys" have been shown to be useful in enhancing activity levels (Mummery, Schofield, Hinchliffe, Joyner, & Brown, 2006). Similar approaches applied to the school setting have also been trialled (Oliver, Schofield, & McEvoy, 2006), yet the full potential of web-supported class-based walking challenges to provide data and/or learning experiences to achieve learning outcomes within the academic curriculum remains largely undeveloped. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of using a web-supported class-based walking challenge by identifying cross-curricular linkages to the mandated Queensland curriculum at the Year 5 level. These linkages are described in detail and barriers and constraints to delivery are described. Recommendations for teachers and schools contemplating a similar activity are provided.
