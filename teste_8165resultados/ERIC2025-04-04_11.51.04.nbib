AB  - This article examines the importance of caring in schools and school leadership. It analyzes the concept of caring and how it functions and introduces a model of caring school leadership situated within this broader exposition. The analysis and model are informed by literature including academic and professional works from education and education-related fields and disciplines--philosophy, ethics, feminist theory, positive psychology, and the organizational sciences. In addition, the analysis and model draws on literature of human-service occupations--health care, social services, and the ministry--that consider caring and caring leadership at both interpersonal and organizational levels. The synthesis of this literature results in a multidisciplinary and cross-occupational model that extends and deepens current understanding and theory about caring school leadership.

AB  - Interdisciplinary learning has become prevalent as a means of solving problems encountered in everyday life. Yet, there is a lack of experimental studies investigating strategies to facilitate interdisciplinary learning. This study explored the impacts of timing and types of instructional materials on the study of interdisciplinary subjects. A 2 × 2 quasi-experimental design was conducted in which the first independent variable was the timing of instructional materials (prior versus after) and the other was the types of gameplay (digital versus non-digital game). The dependent variables were learning outcomes and academic emotions. A sample of 134 seventh graders participated in the study. The results indicated that the timing of instructional materials resulted in significant differences on students' learning outcomes. Moreover, the effects of the timing of instructional materials in conjunction with the types of gameplay improved interdisciplinary learning outcomes and induced positive emotions. Discussions of the findings and pedagogical implications are provided.

AB  - Teaching children scientific vocabulary is an important part of science education and should be carefully considered when planning units of work so that children can understand new words and apply them to their learning (Sewell, 2018). This view is echoed in the aims of the National Curriculum in England, which states that pupils should be able to describe associated processes and key characteristics in common language, and should also be familiar with, and use, technical terminology accurately and precisely (DfE, 2013). How and when science vocabulary is taught can be a dilemma as there is much to cover in the science curriculum. There is, therefore, merit in considering how English lessons can be used to develop science language. Children only retain words if they are shown them embedded in meaningful texts and given opportunities to use them in discussion, debates and writing (Snow, 2010). Science can provide such a meaningful context in English lessons. In addition, Ward and Roden (2016) maintain that children find writing conclusions easier if they have developed enough scientific vocabulary to explain and interpret their findings. This article provides examples of how meaningful links can be made between science and English when teaching a unit of work on living things and their environments.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to identify and assess collaborative problem solving (CPS) behaviors in elementary students in science, technology, engineering, arts/humanities and mathematics (STEAM)- related making and to garner students perspectives. We offer a valid way for researchers to understand collaborative processes and for educators to create opportunities for collaboration. Additionally, the feedback from the assessment offers students a way to reflect on their CPS skills. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study evaluated 52 elementary students' CPS skills using co-measure, a validated rubric assessing students' CPS when working in STEAM-related makerspace activities. Students worked in collaborative groups to "make" artifacts when solving a problem posed by their teacher. They were assessed using co-measure's four dimensions: peer interactions, positive communication, inquiry rich/multiple paths and transdisciplinary approaches and scored via each dimension's associated attributes. Student interviews provided their perspectives on CPS. Findings: A majority of students scored in the acceptable or proficient range in the social dimensions of peer interactions and positive communication. Students scored slightly lower on the cognitive dimensions of inquiry rich/multiple paths and markedly lower on transdisciplinary approaches when collaborating. Findings suggest to increase CPS skills, teachers might develop "making" activities fostering greater inquiry and model ways to strategize and verify information, approach the problem drawing on student interest and prior knowledge and collaboratively use tools, materials and methods that mimic the real world when problem-solving. Originality/value: Much of the current research on assessing CPS during making is in the early stages of considering appropriate assessment approaches, especially in schools. To expand this literature the study includes elementary students between the ages of 6-10, the focus is on assessing their collaboration using an observational rubric. The authors use preliminary findings from young children's perspectives on making to position the future work.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had its impact on research and researchers, and hence potentially on the future of academia. Yet, empirical evidence on the impact of COVID-19 on PhD candidates is limited. This study explores the influences of the pandemic on PhD candidates' progress and wellbeing. In addition, the aim is to identify potentially particularly vulnerable candidate groups. In total, 768 PhD candidates from a Finnish research-intensive multidisciplinary university participated in the mixed method study in spring 2021. The data were collected with the doctoral experience survey. In general, the PhD candidates estimated that the COVID-19 pandemic had hindered their progress and decreased their study wellbeing. The negative impact boiled down to the reduced access to data or participants, erosion of scholarly support networks, reduced access to the institutional resources, poor work-life balance and mental health problems. Results further implied that the international candidates, those studying at the university full-time, engaging in research teams, candidates from natural sciences and those at the mid-phase of their studies employed increased risk of suffering from negative COVID-19 pandemic influences. Results can be used in building well-fitted re-creative actions in supporting the PhD candidates to overcome challenges set by the pandemic.

AB  - Initial teacher education (ITE) needs to respond to the huge increase in research in neuroscience that informs our understanding of learning. Educational applications of cognitive psychology, in particular from the field of memory, are strongly evident in government policy documents in England, but as yet the wider contribution of educational neuroscience is not explicit. ITE needs to open trainee teachers' thinking to these perspectives and what can be learned from them, but also needs to examine them critically and in relation to other forms of educational knowledge and aims. This article explains how one university is taking an interdisciplinary approach to this challenge to develop their ITE curriculum.

AB  - Professional knowledge is highlighted as an important prerequisite of both medical doctors and teachers. Based on recent conceptions of professional knowledge in these fields, knowledge can be differentiated within several aspects. However, these knowledge aspects are currently conceptualized differently across different domains and projects. Thus, this paper describes recent frameworks for professional knowledge in medical and educational sciences, which are then integrated into an interdisciplinary two-dimensional model of professional knowledge that can help to align terminology in both domains and compare research results. The models' two dimensions differentiate between cognitive types of knowledge and content-related knowledge facets and introduces a terminology for all emerging knowledge aspects. The models' applicability for medical and educational sciences is demonstrated in the context of diagnosis by describing prototypical diagnostic settings for medical doctors as well as for teachers, which illustrate how the framework can be applied and operationalized in these areas. Subsequently, the role of the different knowledge aspects for acting and the possibility of transfer between different content areas are discussed. In conclusion, a possible extension of the model along a "third dimension" that focuses on the effects of growing expertise on professional knowledge over time is proposed and issues for further research are outlined.

AB  - The longstanding relationship between art and geography continues to develop through a "creative re/turn" as more geographers apply creative methodologies within their research, and more artists situate their work within geography discourse. This paper presents a case study of a participatory art working session held in collaboration with Newcastle University Institute for Sustainability that models potential applications of the creative re/turn within Higher Education. Taking climate change as an invitation to innovate and reimagine, the working session brought together researchers, educators and administrators from across the university's natural and social sciences to use an artistic toolkit to design the fictional new town BWK-BCN (read: Berwick-Barcelona), a town merging Berwick-upon-Tweed on the Scottish borders with Barcelona as a radical adaptation to climate change. The case study identifies key benefits and practical challenges of interdisciplinary approaches to climate change teaching and research. Despite some challenges, this paper suggests that collaborations with participatory art practices can provide the critical reflective and imaginative space to support creative research, learning, and engagement processes essential for tackling the unprecedented complexity that climate change presents.

AB  - Recent years, research on curriculum-based ideological and political education has been one of hotspots in the field of higher education in China. Using both literature analysis software of CiteSpace and VOSviewer, visual analysis and information collection have been carried out on 429 papers of Chinese curriculum-based ideological and political education from 2014 to 2021, so as to find out the research focuses and evolution in this field and then to predict the trend in the future. The results are that the hotspots of ideological and political research focus on the definition of its connotation, construction value, and the exploration of practical paths. Furthermore, current research frontiers including "ideological and political elements", "talent cultivation", "college physical education (PE)" and "core socialist values" reflect that the current study focuses on the exploration of practical paths. It is expected that education mechanism, teaching practice research and multidisciplinary research will become the main trends of curriculum-based ideological and political education in China in future.

AB  - This study compared two versions of the same elementary science professional development (PD) and curriculum program that were offered face-to-face and completely online, while keeping all content consistent between the two. Using quantitative analyses of pre- and posttests of content knowledge (CK), we evaluated the extent to which the online version of the PD compared to the face-to-face PD for increasing the earth science and art CK of upper elementary teachers required to teach an earth science and art integrated curriculum. Additionally, we explored how the impact of PD modality (online vs. face-to-face) on teachers' CK learning outcomes differed for novice and experienced teachers. Findings revealed significantly higher CK learning gains for teachers who participated in online PD compared with face-to-face PD, but with a small effect size. Subgroup analysis revealed that compared with experienced teachers, the novice teachers had significantly higher CK gains from participating in the online PD compared to the face-to-face version with a large effect size. We also discuss the implications for the design of large-scale online teacher PD.

AB  - Statistics is interdisciplinary and the practical application of statistical methods in various areas prompts undergraduates to learn more about statistics and better understand complex methods. This article presents a classroom teaching design that guides students in reading COVID-19 literature. The activities presented encourage peer-peer and student-instructor interaction, which can be modified based on the type of course offered as well as the level and major of students by changing the articles required for reading. The teaching activities are designed with evidence-based teaching strategies such as scaffolding and connecting the activities to learning outcomes aligned with levels of Bloom's Taxonomy. In our experience, the COVID-19 literature teaching activity improves students' learning interest, cultivates students' critical thinking, and enhances students' understanding of theoretical methods.

AB  - The purpose is to contribute knowledge to the field regarding the role of aesthetic experience when young students participate in intertwined science-art activities in science class. More precisely, we scrutinise how science suggestions are shaped in students' processes of imagination when exploring animal's ecology. Data corpus comprises audio recordings, photographs, drawings and field notes. The school is located in Sweden and the participating students were between 6 and 7 years old (Swedish grade 1). Seven students and their teacher participated in the study. The dialogues were analysed by means of a practical epistemology analysis (PEA), based on Dewey and the later Wittgenstein. In addition, the analytical term pictorial relation is launched to analyse the visual language exposed in students' drawings. The results reveal that throughout the process, the young students in transaction with the contextual features, imagined suggestions and solutions to science-related issues. Facts and fiction, sense and nonsense blended when new solutions of pleasurable hiding-places for prey were aesthetically and imaginatively explored and designed. In addition, the students owned the problem throughout and developed agency, which resulted in novel science-art outcomes and the students' communicative repertoire was extended when involved in intertwined dialogues and art activities.

AB  - Under the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, an interdisciplinary project about the brewing and analysis of traditional Chinese rice wine was performed at home by junior students of the chemistry major at Huanggang Normal University under the remote guidance of teachers during the spring lockdown semester of 2020. Students were exposed to the concepts of yeast metabolism, analytical testing, and sensory evaluation in terms of real project study and completed a series of hands-on activities at home using readily available materials, utensils, and self-made devices. In the spring semester of 2021, experiments were conducted in the general lab with other students in the same program to compare the results of the two groups of students. The results were that the "home" results were credible, the students were trained not only in laboratory skills but also in analytical and communication skills, and, significantly, the majority of students enjoyed the content and activities. This paper illustrates an effective experimental design procedure that can be conducted at home or in the laboratory in response to uncertain changes, such as a pandemic lockdown.

AB  - The implementation of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) at school is one of the challenges of education in the twenty-first century, especially concerning the development of critical thinking during argumentative interactions. In this paper, I refer to an interdisciplinary approach with the aim to analyze the implicit inferential reasoning emerging in argumentative discussions among children during scientific activities. The study involved 25 preschool children at a kindergarten engaged in three problem solving tasks. The first activity was to build a tunnel, the second to build a bridge--both with the use of Lego©--and the third to build an hourglass with recycled materials. The tasks were video-recorded and the discussions transcribed. The analysis implied different steps: first, I identified the argumentative structure of each exchange according to the pragma-dialectical approach; then, I found the implicit premises using the Argumentum Model of Topics; afterward, I analyzed the argumentative discussions according to a sociocultural approach. The findings show a predominance of arguments based on causal relationships and indicate how children reason regarding complex aspects of a problem, such as the negative consequences of an action, the adequacy of the available tools, and the (possible) future conditions connected to the scientific activity they are involved in. The study opens a possibility to shift from how to implement STEM activities to what children already do when engaged in scientific tasks. It also encourages the adoption of an interdisciplinary approach to investigating the complex process of argumentation in preschool children.

AB  - Evaluation of interdisciplinary, team science research initiatives is an evolving and challenging field. This descriptive, longitudinal, mixed methods case study examined how an embedded, formative evaluation approach contributed to team science in the interdisciplinary Research into Policy to Enhance Physical Activity (REPOPA) project, which focused on physical activity policymaking in six European countries with divergent policy systems and researcher--policymaker networks. We assessed internal project collaboration, communication, and networking in four annual data collection cycles with REPOPA team members. Data were collected using work package team and individual interviews, and quantitative collaboration and social network questionnaires. Interviews were content analyzed; social networks among team members and with external stakeholder were examined; collaboration scores were compared across 4 years using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Annual monitoring reports with action recommendations were prepared and discussed with consortium members. Results revealed consistently high response rates. Collaboration and communication scores, high at baseline, improved slightly, but ANOVA results were nonsignificant. Internal network changes tracked closely with implementation progress. External stakeholders were primarily governmental, with a marked shift from local/provincial level to national/international during the project. Diversity (disciplinary, organizational, and geopolitical) was a project asset influencing and also challenging collaboration, implementation, and knowledge translation strategies. In conclusion, formative evaluation using an embedded, participatory approach demonstrated utility, acceptability, and researcher engagement. A trusting relationship between evaluators and other project members built on joint identification of team science objectives for the evaluation at project outset, codeveloping guiding principles, and encouraging team reflexivity throughout the evaluation.

AB  - This study aims at determining the science concepts and subjects used in the "religion courses" taught in secondary schools and the contribution of science to religion courses, which is not a widely studied topic in the relevant literature. Like qualitative research, this study is a multiple case study. The data were collected using a semi-structured interview with five Muslim religion teachers working in an eastern city of Turkey. The interview data were analyzed using the basic descriptive and content analysis methods. The findings showed that religion teachers benefit from the concepts and subjects of science in their courses; using life sciences in their religion courses had a positive impact in teaching religious subjects better to the students; the use of the concepts of life sciences in religion courses enabled students to perceive the subject better; students enjoyed the use of science concepts in religion courses and also students asked questions to their teachers about many subjects of life sciences. Religion teachers expressed that they did not feel competent enough in the life sciences. Some recommendations, such as organizing in-service training have been made for religion teachers to feel competent enough in life sciences.

AB  - Background/purpose: In terms of computational thinking core facets, algorithmic thinking is a key competency applicable not only in Computer Science but also in aspects of daily life. Considering the global phenomenon of gender stereotypes with regards to the academic and professional orientation in STEM fields, we focused on investigating the level of students' algorithmic thinking skills by gender in early childhood. This article provides evidence of research implemented under the umbrella of quantitative methodology, employing an innovative assessment tool constructed to meet the requirements of the study. The findings obtained could facilitate researchers and policymakers to support equity in learning opportunities, starting from the first stage of compulsory education. Materials/methods: The study aligns to the principles of quantitative research methodology. Its backbone is a digital platform of multidisciplinary, play-based, and constructivist character, which we implemented from scratch in order to satisfy the requirements of our research. Results: The findings of the study revealed that algorithmic thinking skills are not related to students' gender in early childhood. Conclusion: The findings of the study bring out that, at very young ages, the effect of gender stereotypes is not observable as far as students' algorithmic thinking skills are concerned. The implications of the study highlight the need to focus on the schooling stages that follow early childhood in order to tackle the gender gap in STEM fields.

AB  - This article examined the role of environmental interaction in interdisciplinary thinking and the use of different knowledge resource types. The case study was conducted with two classes (N = 40) of 8th-grade students, ages 13 to 14. The outdoor trail aimed to help students synthesize history, geography, and science knowledge. Two groups' discourse from each class was audio-­recorded and transcribed for content analysis. We coded the discourse to examine: (i) the use of different knowledge resource types (i.e., "contextual resource," "new conceptual resource," "prior knowledge resource"); (ii) the relationship among these knowledge resource types; and (iii) evidences of interdisciplinary thinking. Findings showed that contextual resources enhanced students' capacity to develop new conceptual resources and to activate prior knowledge resources. Further, about 80% of students' discourse demonstrated interdisciplinary connections of two subjects.

AB  - Animal models are widely used in laboratory practicals in biomedical disciplines. However, experiments involving animal work are usually time-and-labor consuming. It is also costly to run an animal lab and the animal caring/holding request special training. Here we present a laboratory course design that provides students with wet lab experience in gene editing in mouse stem cell lines using CRSISPR/Cas9 and dry lab experience in generating transgenic mouse models using computer simulation. This workshop is for senior undergraduates as well as graduate students and is designed to help them understand the application of gene editing in biomedical research. The virtual simulation is incorporated as a computer-based alternative to using mice for embryo transplantation, breeding, and characterization. The integrated curriculum of wet and dry laboratories enabled us to complete this complicate multi-disciplinary experiment in one semester. In addition, the computer-based alternatives reduce the unnecessary animal tests down to zero and errors during practice are well-tolerated without raising any ethical issues. The survey and student's feedback showed overall satisfaction in their learning experiences and learning benefits. The evaluation of the outcomes of learning objectives on the completion of this course revealed positive achievements in bioinformatics, molecular biology, and in general animal work

AB  - Formalized participation in professional service is not often part of the college experience, especially for first-year students in chemistry courses. When service opportunities are offered, they are most often through elective credit, upper-level courses, extracurricular clubs, and the rare service-learning courses. We have successfully incorporated a large science service-learning opportunity into the general chemistry laboratory that provides multidisciplinary educational experiences for children and the community. The experience for the college students involves several weeks of preparation for a two-week laboratory module and participation in the public event on the university campus. College students involved in the second year of the event were surveyed to determine the impact of formalized participation in professional service on their attitude toward science and participation in future professional service events. Highly positive responses on the surveys and public interest in the event suggest continuing and expanding on the science offerings in our geographic location. (Contains 3 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - The significant global interest in 21st century skills and their incorporation into school curricula inspired the researchers of the current study to develop a new educational approach of designing curricula that incorporates science, mathematics, technology, arts and engineering (STEAM). In this study, the researchers reviewed several relevant frameworks of curriculum integration in elementary education. Based on previously suggested models, a new model was built up for curriculum development and a STEAM-based activity was presented specifically designed in accordance with the recent theoretical models and practices in STEM education, with the domain of Arts added to it. The activity serves as an example of curriculum development and as a guide to help further development of such activities. This study attempted to provide how math and science curricula can be integrated in a pedagogical knowledge-based framework to show how beneficial and effective is scientific knowledge in real life application if an integrated curriculum is used. The study recommends that increasing the number of integrated math and science methods courses can support primary education teachers in implementing STEAM curriculum within their programs of study.

AB  - Students who engage in undergraduate research experiences acquire many benefits, including an understanding of how scientific knowledge is constructed, recognition that knowledge can be complex and uncertain, and the habit of viewing knowledge critically. This paper describes a first-year two-course sequence that provides multidisciplinary opportunities for international science students to engage in the research process and present at a student-led research conference. We describe course goals and structure, and discuss whether the goals were attained using instructor reflections, student performance, and student survey data. We also evaluate the impact of changes to the curriculum between Year 1 and Year 2. In both years, we found that students engaged meaningfully with the research process and began to understand how scientific knowledge is created. We also found that a modular model with front-end support worked better for instructors as compared to a continuous individualized project mentorship model. This modular approach involved structured pre- and post-class assignments within discipline-specific themes containing examples of the research process embedded into the discipline. These discipline-specific modules were followed by modules covering broader research process themes. We encourage instructors who are thinking of delivering a similar research-based course for first-year students to provide support via example research questions and other example templates for student submissions.

AB  - There is a growing demand for degreed science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) professionals, but the production of degreed STEM students is not keeping pace. Problems exist at every juncture along the pipeline. Too few students choose to major in STEM disciplines. Many of those who do major in STEM drop out or change majors. Females and minorities remain underrepresented in STEM. The success rate of college students who are from low-income background or first-generation students is much lower than that of students who do not face such challenges. Some of those who successfully complete their degree need help in making the transition to the workforce after graduation. A program at Lamar University takes a multidisciplinary approach to addressing these problems. It is designed to recruit, retain and transition undergraduates to careers in STEM, focusing its efforts on five science disciplines and on these "at-risk" students. The program was supported by a 5-year grant from the National Science Foundation and is supported through August 31, 2016 by Lamar University and a grant from ExxonMobil. A formal assessment plan documents the program's success. The program received an award from the Texas Higher Education Board for its contributions towards Closing the Gaps in Higher Education in Texas. This paper describes the program's theoretical framework, research questions, methods, evaluation plan, and instruments. It presents an analysis of the results achieved using these methods and implications for improvements to the program resulting from lessons learned.

AB  - This article examines the emerging literature on the need for a synergy between neuroscience and educational sciences, identifying several differences in approach and methods that hinder the connecting processes between these two disciplines. From this review a transdisciplinary framework is presented which is based on the systemic and lifelong property of plasticity. The notion of plasticity is a framing concept that enables to connect disciplines because it illuminates the understanding of the learning processes. The new framework for the understanding and research in neuro-education is based on a systemic and functional architecture organised in three dimensions of plasticity (autonomy--vulnerability--resilience) and at least three systemic levels (genes, experience and the nervous system). We conclude that the concept of plasticity contributes to enlarging our understanding of the educational diversity of learners in their experiential contexts, combined with special attention to human agency and the capacity to making choices and effect changes.

AB  - Education ethnographies show that observing bodies, objects and settings can illuminate previously hidden learning practices but the relational characteristics of these practices presents methodological challenges for conventional qualitative analyses. Using an example from an ethnographic study of everyday learning, I show how methods from art (specifically researcher-created drawings) can address some of these challenges. I use the concept of 'epistemic objects' to theorise drawings as analysis, and to show that rather than being a process of deconstruction, this analysis is constantly bringing knowledge into being. With original interdisciplinary insights from art/social science, this article problematises art in sociomaterial research and offers direction for relational analyses.

AB  - Shared expertise, team teaching, and cooperation among lecturers from different fields have become more and more important in promoting learning and achieving more innovative learning outcomes in multidisciplinary universities. To increase and improve sharing expertise between teachers from different faculties and disciplines, we wanted, on one hand, to identify skills and competences that teachers have in common and, on the other hand, to find areas in which they identify that they need complementation. As a framework for this research, we applied Lee Shulman's (1986) seven categories of teachers' knowledge base including the theory of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). The data were collected by group discussions. The teachers (N = 22) represented all seven faculties of Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences (UAS), that is, Business School, Civil Engineering and Building Services, Culture and Creative Industries, Health Care and Nursing, School of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Industrial Engineering, and Welfare and Human Functioning. The data were analyzed using theory-based content analysis. According to our data, the mutual core competence of a teacher is the capacity to interact effectively. It is a basis for shared expertise. Interaction skills are necessary in collaborative construction of knowledge as students, teachers of different fields, and their partners inside and outside the organization co-operate. Multidisciplinary co-operation among colleagues also helps to maintain subject matter knowledge, as it supports peer learning and encourages everyone to move out of their comfort zones.

AB  - In this paper, we report on an intervention across continents and disciplines that brought together differently positioned students in South Africa and the USA. A collaboration between our classes--an introductory Geographic Information Systems (GIS) class in South Africa and a composition class in the United States--was facilitated and investigated by us. The point of departure of the intervention was to service socially just and anti-racist pedagogies through experimentation. Drawing on posthumanist, feminist, and new materialist theory, we investigate the hauntings of several prejudices and stereotypical tropes that foster racism. We link the concept of hauntology to Plumwood's (1993) theorization of dualisms. We then draw a cartography of geomatics education in South Africa, focusing on the subjectification of geomatics graduates in particular and engineering graduates in general. We then zoom to our collaboration, and focus on several interactions amongst the cohorts to show instances of hauntings that perpetuate anti-Black, anti-Muslim, and related silences. We find that analysis of dualisms can highlight racist hauntings, and can also provide guidance on how to flatten hierarchies. Our transdisciplinary activism allows us to harness the positivity of difference to trouble binaries. We conclude with some thoughts on pandemic pedagogy in an unequal world.

AB  - The current study provided cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary analyses of the distribution of directives in discussion and conclusion sections of English and Persian research articles (RAs) in disciplines of physics, chemistry, counseling, and sociology, representing hard and soft sciences, respectively. To that aim, 80 RAs from both English and Persian journals between 2000 and 2012 were selected. The RAs were textually analyzed to determine the distribution of directives. Findings revealed a significant difference between Persian hard and soft science RAs in the employment of directives, with soft science writers employing directives more frequently in discussion and conclusion sections in comparison with hard science writers. However, no significant difference was found in the distribution of directives across discussion and conclusion sections of English soft and hard RAs. Moreover, findings did not show a significant difference across Persian and English RAs. Overall, results suggest that Persian and English academic writers tend to follow a similar generic and discursive trend in the employment of directives in their discussion and conclusion sections pointing to the universal nature of directives as persuasive strategies employed by academic writers in canonical branches of science. The findings of the present study might raise learners' awareness of the conventions and lexico-grammatical features of academic writing in Persian and/or English RAs.

AB  - District-led Professional Development (DLPD) holds great promise for cost-effective and sustained PD for K-12 faculty but is often enacted as whole-group, one-shot meetings on topics (e.g., 21st-century learning) non-specific to teachers' grade levels and content areas. Alternatively, Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) provide on-site and ongoing collaborative support to teachers by common grade levels or content areas. To best leverage DLPD and PLCs, an exploratory multiple case study was conducted to examine how three separate high schools' biology PLCs had received and enacted DLPD in teaching 21st-century skills. Desimone and Pak's five core features of effective PD were used as the theoretical framework to explore teachers' perceptions of the semester-long DLPD through interviews, lesson plans, PLC agendas, and classroom observations. Case analyses found that participating biology teachers perceived that the "coherence" and "content focus" was the greatest affordances of having 21st century focused DLPD in their PLC. "Collective participation," "active learning," and "duration" were revealed respectively. Results suggested teachers had incorporated the 21st-century skill of "communication" the most and "creativity" the least in their practice. Findings suggest that DLPD embedded within PLCs provide contextualized PD opportunities to high school biology teachers when there is sufficient time and opportunities for translating knowledge into practice.

AB  - Background: The field of collaborative biostatistics plays a critical role in translating scientific discoveries into practical applications by providing sound statistical analysis, ensuring data integrity, and facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration in translational science and decision-making in healthcare. The role of a collaborative biostatistician is particularly important in addiction and mental health research given the use of complex study designs and statistical methodology, along with large amounts of missing data and study dropout. Despite growth in the demand for collaborative biostatisticians and the number of graduate degrees in biostatistics earned in the United States in recent years, the percentage from underrepresented minorities remains low. To increase awareness and bring diversity to the field of collaborative biostatistics, the Collaborative Undergraduate Biostatistics Experience (CUBE) was developed. CUBE is built on four pillars: training in introductory biostatistics, R programming, professional development, and mentorship through a collaborative biostatistics research project focused in the areas of addiction and mental health. This paper provides an overview of the key components of the CUBE curriculum, evaluation metrics, and results from the CUBE cohort of summer 2023 (N=5). Results: Eighty percent of participants were female students entering their fourth year of undergraduate study. From pre- to post-program, participants demonstrated increased knowledge in the overall research process, ethical and professional aspects of research, basic concepts in research, data analysis, data management, report preparation, and presenting research. With respect to future education and career plans, most participants felt more confident in planning for their graduate school education and pursuing a career in biostatistics or research. Conclusions: Results from CUBE 2023 highlight its positive impact on participants, particularly in terms of knowledge enhancement and future aspirations. Most participants experienced significant improvements in their understanding of various aspects of the research process. The program played a pivotal role in fostering confidence, and thus positively influencing their future. These results affirm the effectiveness of the CUBE program in equipping aspiring researchers with the skills and confidence needed for successful endeavors in the fields of biostatistics, research, and translational science, with an emphasis on addiction and mental health.

AB  - Much of the mathematical reasoning employed in the typical introductory physics course can be traced to Pythagorean roots planted over two thousand years ago. Besides obvious examples involving the Pythagorean theorem, I draw attention to standard physics problems and derivations which often unknowingly rely upon the Pythagoreans' work on proportion, music, geometry, harmony, the golden ratio, and cosmology. Examples are drawn from mechanics, electricity, sound, optics, energy conservation and relativity. An awareness of the primary sources of the mathematical techniques employed in the physics classroom could especially benefit students and educators at schools which encourage integration of their various courses in history, science, philosophy, and the arts.

AB  - Audiovisual Translation (AVT) and Assistive Technology (AST) are two fields that share common grounds within accessibility-related research, yet they are rarely studied in combination. The reason most often lies in the fact that they have emerged from different disciplines, i.e. Translation Studies and Computer Science, making a possible combined approach quite a demanding task due to their interdisciplinarity and the need for exploration of various parameters. Moreover, by focusing on certain needs and modes, several angles are added to the investigation. At the same time, due to their specific characteristics, the possibility of practical and applicable proposals towards the achievement of accessible education can be high. This paper aims to present some basic connections between the different disciplines involved in the "Accessible Online Education Research", whose goal is to provide a theoretical framework for the joint investigation of AVT and AST-based approaches to accessible online education, and suggest possible implementations of the two disciplines for the creation of universal educational environments.

AB  - In Europe, liberal arts and sciences undergraduate university programmes are typically characterised by a high degree of freedom of choice in the curriculum. Educators often present this as allowing students to design an integrated, interdisciplinary curriculum around their particular interests. This paper explores how students in such programmes understand and experience that freedom. It postulates a theoretical typology of reasons why one might value curricular freedom and, based on 59 interviews with students from 13 such programmes, considers what aspects of this typology resonate with students. The paper concludes that students overwhelmingly see freedom of choice in the curriculum as an opportunity to try out different disciplines to discover which ones they enjoy most. While this eventually does lead them to making tailored choices about their studies, their path to this goal is more meandering than is commonly understood. This insight allows programmes with a significant amount of freedom of choice to better support students in their educational development.

AB  - The PhD by Publication offers doctoral students an opportunity to focus on publishing during their candidature. A considerable body of literature has explored questions of legitimacy, consistency and quality of this model of scholarship, while students have reflected on how this approach helped build a publishing track record and develop skills associated with writing scholarly articles [Jackson, D. (2013). Completing a PhD by publication: A review of Australian policy and implications for practice. "Higher Education Research & Development," 32(3), 355-368; Robins, L., & Kanowski, P. (2008). PhD by publication: A student's perspective. "Journal of Research Practice," 4(2), 1-20]. However, there is a need to explore how this approach both shapes and reflects the student experience of doctoral studies. This auto-ethnographical article analyses my own experience of the PhD by Publication. On the one hand, this method suited my multidisciplinary research topic and approach to research and assisted the flexibility and creativity of my research. On the other, I began to view my value as a researcher and the value of my research, in terms of the quantitative performance metrics of research in output, citation counts and h-index. Concept of performativity, I analyse how the PhD by Publication potentially reshapes what it is to be a doctoral student, and how the value of doctoral students is construed by themselves and others within their university.

AB  - In my response to Alexander's (2018) paper marking the 125th anniversary of the American Psychological Association and the field of educational psychology, I have taken the perspective of a member of our discipline from some time in the future who is contributing to a larger work looking back at the history and development of our field (thus, a "future retrospective"). As this "future author," I focus on Alexander's (2018) article and selected developments in our field and more broadly since 2018. Two of the five thematic areas of influence that had established an enduring legacy for the field identified by Alexander are the primary focus: (a) interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary inquiry and (b) evidence-based practice (EBP). The concepts of theoretical integration and theoretical integrationists are discussed in relation to these themes. Early barriers to interdisciplinary approaches, including paradigm wars and a proliferation of false dichotomies, are noted. The emergence of complexity sciences and a complex systems framework for understanding learning and development is discussed, leading to deeper understanding of the unique social and historical context that shaped and informed our work in the second decade of the 21st-century, as well as the multifaceted context we work within today. Given the interwoven nature of the five thematic areas identified by Alexander, however, aspects of the other thematic areas and Alexander's thoughts on the future of educational psychology are also encountered. I concur with Alexander in hoping that her paper and the responses to it generate discussion.

AB  - This article presents the research findings of a multidisciplinary team's collective research effort at one university over a five-year period as funded by the National Science Foundation's "Improving Undergraduate STEM Education" (IUSE) program. A collaborative learning and retention action research effort at a large Hispanic Serving Institution is analyzed using mixed methods to document the power of collective impact as the foundation for a learning support model for students historically underrepresented majoring in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) academic programs. The actions of the team of researchers are presented to describe the "Rising Stars Collective Impact" model and the impacts achieved. This is a model that aligns objectives, intervention efforts, and reports collective results. The long-term goals of the "Rising Stars Collective Impact" multiple programs managed by the funded program team included the following: (a) to improve the campus sense of community for students historically under-represented in STEM, (b) to establish innovative and robust STEM education research-based practices to support critical skill attainment for students, and (c) to support faculty understanding of the funds of knowledge of diverse students. The positive student retention and success impacts of this research effort are measured through quantitative statistical analysis of the changes in second-year STEM undergraduate student retention rates and representation rates of women, Hispanics, and African American STEM majors.

AB  - From media news coverage to fluctuating gas prices, the topic of energy is hard to ignore. However, little connection often exists between energy use in our daily lives and the presentation of energy-related concepts in the science classroom. The concepts of energy production and consumption bring together knowledge from several science disciplines to both enhance student understanding and seek solutions to important global problems. This article provides an overview of activities and discussions teachers can use to address the questions raised about biofuels in biology, chemistry, and physics classes. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - As educators we are facing an unprecedented challenge to prepare our students not only for traditional careers but also for future careers that don't exist today. Many of these careers will require a firm grounding in disciplines such as physics, along with multidisciplinary, Global, and systems thinking skill sets. Our Multidisciplinary Sustainability Education (MSE) project is addressing this challenge by creating sustainability-themed modules where a variety of courses in a range of disciplines tackle relevant, real-world problems from each discipline's perspective. Each course involved in a module, which addresses an overarching question, has students write technical reports, using their discipline knowledge to address the question, and they are expected to read and synthesize reports from other discipline-based courses. This paper discusses one of our modules, "What Are the Current and Future Impacts of Global Climate Change on Polar Bears?" and how students studying thermal physics can help answer this question.

AB  - The current focus on STEM education is based on the idea that science, technology, engineering and math be taught in an interdisciplinary and applied approach in grades K-12. There is growing attention to integrating the arts as an equal partner to STEM learning (STEAM). The purpose of this cluster random sample experimental study was to examine the effect of visual art instruction, specifically drawing, on long-term retention of science content. Fifty-five fifth and sixth grade students participated in this study, 31 in the experimental group and 24 in the control group. Both groups received instruction based on a modified science lesson developed by Arizona State University in cooperation with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The experimental group received instruction on art techniques to be used for drawing and the development of visual notes while the control group used traditional note taking and writing. A delayed post-test revealed that the drawing group scored significantly higher for retention of content. Implications for authentic arts integration revealed by this study suggest that the arts play a significant role in learning and content retention in art and science. More significantly, the participants in this study were at the level of proficiency and labeled gifted (minimum IQ of 130), demonstrating that arts integration is effective with a more diverse population than marginalized students studied in previously investigations.

AB  - This article highlights the multianalytical study of exuded liquid from an ancient Egyptian sealed alabaster vase by Master's students in an applied chemistry for cultural heritage course. Master students are introduced to the field of Archaeometry that see the collaboration of experts in different areas of research such as conservators, curators of museums, physicists, chemists, etc. The sample is a residue exuded on the linen strip sealing an ancient Egyptian alabaster vase (inventory number S.8448) from the collection of the Museo Egizio in Turin (Italy). The students start to plan the noninvasive investigation by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) for the inorganic compounds characterization, followed by the extraction of the organic components (such as oils, fats, and waxes) to be analyzed by high-resolution [superscript 1]H and [superscript 13]C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and 2D NMR correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), and long-range heteronuclear correlation (HMBC) techniques and by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Reference standards, spectral databases, and published data on similar artifacts served as the basis for the interpretation of the instrumental results. The approach was introduced in the course of Applied Chemistry for Cultural Heritage for Master students in Archaeology (University of Palermo, Italy), where the need is to know how to approach the scientific investigation together with the conservation scientists and how to manage with a very low amount of sample. Pedagogically, the approach introduces students to the main techniques currently used in the field of Archaeometry while reinforcing fundamental concepts in sample collecting and multicomponent microsample analysis. This interdisciplinary approach provides a unique experience that demonstrates chemistry's broad applicability outside of the traditional laboratory. Students are guided to identify the inorganic and organic components of the exudate liquid: the first one is ascribable to clay minerals iron oxides, which could impart the brown color to the sample; the second one is ascribed to triglycerides of various kinds, which probably comes from vegetable oil.

AB  - While the multimodal nature of the languages of science is now broadly recognised, the role of affect and aesthetics in these languages, and the potential for this aesthetic focus to add to these languages, has tended to be ignored. Research into these languages has mainly focused on a codification of their functions, an approach to which aesthetics study would seem not broadly suited because of its ephemeral, complex, relatively unpredictable and affective nature. However, there is a growing awareness of its importance in learning. In this paper, we analyse a case study of art-science integration on the topic of optics to (a) put a case for the value of an explicit focus on aesthetics in science learning and (b) to clarify how teachers might integrate conceptual learning and aesthetic experiences into a broadened account of the languages of science. We argue that this focus on aesthetic responses needs to be included in accounts of productive science classroom discourse because such responses (a) enhance student motivation to learn, (b) enact generative sign-making in this discourse, (c) enrich student habits of perception in inquiry-based-learning and (d) licence more creative learning processes and outcomes. These effects are consistent with widespread policy advocacy of the need for students to find learning in science more meaningful.

AB  - Museum partnerships can involve significant tensions, especially when these collaborations reach across institutions to blend disciplines such as art and mathematics. Rather than simply being obstacles to overcome, we suggest that tensions arising in multi-institutional, cross-disciplinary collaborations can be highly generative for collaborators, sparking new approaches to practice and catalyzing professional growth. To support this idea, we describe an interdisciplinary professional development program for museum practitioners focused on developing innovative programs and exhibits integrating Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics (STEAM). We discuss the design of this STEAM Professional Learning Laboratory in terms of a shared-facilitation model and relate that model to specific tensions that arose in this collaboration. Based on evaluation data, we summarize key characteristics of the Lab that supported successful collaboration and interdisciplinary learning. We share learning outcomes we documented for art and science museum professionals who participated in the Lab. We conclude with considerations for others in the field engaging in similar efforts. A bibliography is included.

AB  - Promoting health equity necessitates the diversification of healthcare workforces. Disability is one aspect of diversity that is increasing in healthcare. While the number of Disabled students in health professions increases, barriers in their work integrated learning (WIL), such as placements in hospitals or clinics, persist. While literature has addressed some of these barriers, there is less known about the social processes that enable access in work integrated learning when it does occur. Therefore, an interdisciplinary team from design, geography, occupational science, nursing, occupational therapy, critical disability studies, and knowledge mobilization explored questions regarding social processes involved in WIL accessibility in clinical settings. The team conducted twenty-five in-depth interviews with 4 placement coordinators, 8 placement supervisors, 6 access professionals, 4 education leaders (e.g. Deans) and 3 healthcare leaders (e.g. site education leaders) from two hospitals and two universities in eastern Canada. The team's collaborative thematic analysis of participant narratives constructed four themes regarding the invisible work clinical and academic educators engage in to create access: putting in extra time, doing emotional labour, engaging in relational work, and navigating complexities. This labour is unrecognized and optional, and therefore its result--access to education--is inequitably distributed. Educators, policy makers, and institutions need to know how access is created in WIL to promote diversity within health professions and systems.

AB  - This paper describes a pilot study that explores students learning how to program via a multi-disciplinary approach. The study participants were eleven 6th grade students who learned programming fundamentals via music activities in a Scratch 3.0 environment. These activities included the programming of familiar melodies and the development of suitable animations or computer games. For that matter, a study unit termed MelodyCode was developed in the spirit of the STEAM education approach and the spiral learning method and included exploration tasks based on individual learning. Via the programming of familiar melodies, they became acquainted with programming concepts such as functions, variables, repetition and control commands, parallel processes, and more. Competitions that win awards were held from time to time, which prompted students to invest efforts in their projects to reach first place and gain the teacher and classmates' appreciation. The study was conducted in the form of action research. The data analysis yielded references to the effect of MelodyCode on common stereotypes students hold regarding programming (masculine profession, necessitates good mathematics knowledge), cognitive aspects (cognitive load, linking music concrete use to abstract programming concepts), and affective aspects (joyful and relaxing class atmosphere, motivation, curiosity, self-efficacy).

AB  - Using a perspective analysis of curriculum design, we advance the conversation on ways underrepresented and underserved communities can rethink educational design. From an original educational model, we interrupt traditional pedagogy to grow effective community leaders. In this paper, we blend Science, Technology, Reading, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STREAM), Place-Based Education (PBE), the North Carolina Standard Course of Study (NCSCOS), and Connectivity Movements to prepare students who are innovative, persistent, and self-determined. Moreover, the Old Main STREAM Academy educational model represents an approach that blends learning and community. It is important for community researchers to apply ancestral educational best practices within their own communities and homelands. From an ethnographic account, our perspective analysis reveals the need for grassroots folks to design and apply an original, comprehensive curriculum that supports the advancement and instructional well-being of underrepresented and underserved communities.

AB  - In order to maintain the United States' global competitiveness and create new and innovative solutions to solve global challenges, more and diverse numbers of STEM graduates need to be attracted and retained in technical disciplines (Committee on Prospering in the Global Economy of the 21st Century: An Agenda for American Science and Technology, 2007). According to the U.S. Department of Education (2015), current national statistics reveal that there continues to be a great shortage of math and science teachers in comparison to the number of students who will actually opt for STEM-related careers. As such, solutions to global challenges will require a new scientific workforce equipped with a skill set of new technology and interdisciplinary thinking, in a culture that is increasingly embracing STEM concepts as a vehicle to address these challenges. The purpose of this article is to contribute to the ongoing discussions among educators, employers, parents, and all those concerned, to seek the goal of interdisciplinary STEM instruction.

AB  - Systematic analysis of undergraduate curriculum design and assessment is required to ensure real world experiences are embedded in a degree structure for a high level of information literacy (IL) attainment. IL competencies and skills are critical for successful graduate outcomes. We developed a framework using a constructive alignment approach to develop the Student Attributes for Information Literacy (SAIL) and accompanying rubric with outcomes that categorize depth of application over degree progression. The rubric was used to audit IL in core units of a multidisciplinary Bachelor of Environmental Science degree before and after a cycle of curriculum design. SAIL's rubric provides educators with a practical and repeatable approach to identifying IL development in units of learning. The SAIL rubric found that IL, for most core units, was taught, practiced, and assessed at the foundational level. At the advanced level, however, students had limited opportunities for literacy training, practice, and assessment in a digital context until the end of the degree. The framework and rubric identified gaps and opportunities in IL attainment, and thus warrants further application. Making sure these gaps are addressed, with opportunities identified for learning throughout a progressive program, will ensure resilient and adaptable graduates in a digital dominant workforce.

AB  - In UK HE institutions there is a growing realisation and appreciation for academic disciplines to seek research partners beyond their own subject (QAA. 2018. Enterprise and entrepreneurship education: Guidance for UK higher education providers. Accessed 1 April 2020. https://www.qaa.ac.uk/docs/qaas/enhancement-and-development/enterprise-and-entrpreneurship-education-2018.pdf?sfvrsn=15f1f981_8). The rewards for developing understanding and sharing methodologies can extend beyond solving research questions to enhance the researcher and student learning experience. When academic researchers and students are given the opportunity to work together outside the confines of the curriculum and inhabit a space of 'otherness' in playful learning, liberated thinking and uninhibited ideation can transform patterns of learning and problem solving. This study aimed to use interdisciplinary co-design workshops to create opportunities for bringing scientists and designers to work together, exposing them to the challenges of developing accessible immunology materials and to develop a pathway to reconcile them through empathy and reflective practice. Our research evidence showed that projects like this are inclusive and engaging. Student participants were excited and inspired by each other's different knowledge and skills, but were also rewarded by overcoming different cultures of learning and communication. The efficacy of playful learning's 'otherness', and the 'out-of-hours' aspect were also interrogated and reflected upon in interviews. The impact of this research will inform pedagogy on interdisciplinary learning, and be a persuasive argument for further Science and Design collaborations. More widely among the community, raised awareness of our immune system has the potential to modify behaviour and improve public health, as the student groups chose to focus on allergies, vaccinations and transplantation.

AB  - Working effectively within multidisciplinary teams is an important employability skill common in postgraduate working life, but opportunities to develop this are limited in many undergraduate taught programmes. The projects reported here offered twelve level 5 undergraduate students from a range of science disciplines the opportunity to work with each other and staff on a specific research question. This paper explores the experience of cross-disciplinary research from both the student and staff research partners' perspectives. In particular the employability skills gained from such partnership working, the potential for developing and demonstrating leadership skills, and the benefits and disadvantages are discussed.

AB  - The purposes of this qualitative case study were to describe the design and the development of a maker-centered learning environment and curriculum by an interdisciplinary team, and to explore how an after-school program that incorporated Maker education and scientific argumentation influenced middle school youths' attitudes toward science in the Midwestern USA. The researchers conducted pre- and post-interviews with six students from non-dominant backgrounds and the teacher, and also administered attitudinal surveys to the six students at two time points (pre/post). Additionally, the researchers video-recorded each after-school session, observed the level of student participation in each activity, and examined student artifacts. At the end of the program, the researchers administered a program survey to the six students. The findings revealed a number of themes. This after-school program eased the tension from the formal science learning with the playful qualities of Making activities and developed the students' practice of social negotiation, which sustained their liking of science. The Making and scientific argumentation activities provided an opportunity to contextualize STEM concepts and practices, which allowed the students to value science by re-affirming as well as expanding their career choices. The Making and scientific argumentation activities helped boost confidence that, up to that point, had been decreasing in formal science learning contexts. The findings speak to the need for future studies that investigate pedagogy issues in Making after-school programs and also examine equity issues in the opportunities for non-dominant youth to participate in these programs.

AB  - For the last seven years, an interdisciplinary course known as "Greener Solutions", offered by the University of California, Berkeley Center for Green Chemistry, has brought together graduate students in chemistry, environmental health, and engineering to understand each other's disciplines, and to work together to develop safer alternatives to hazardous chemicals and manufacturing processes. Through the course, interdisciplinary teams of UC Berkeley students have worked with partner organizations to identify safer alternatives to chemicals of concern, including investigating safer preservatives in personal care products, nonfluorinated durable water-repellant coatings for outerwear, and safer cross-linkers to replace formaldehyde in permanent press textiles and diisocyanates in spray polyurethane foam insulation. Students undertake a bioinspired design process and then assess the potential health and environmental hazards associated with each of their proposed alternatives relative to hazards of the current chemistries. The students generate a focused alternatives assessment that considers technical performance, relative hazard and exposure potential, and feasibility, creating an "opportunity map" for the partner company and, ideally, the industry sector as a whole. The "Greener Solutions" model for interdisciplinary, inquiry-based learning is training a new generation of chemists and engineers in a systems approach to design: one that more fully considers the health and environmental implications of chemical and material choices. An adaptation of the "Greener Solutions" course model to serve undergraduate civil engineering students at University of Victoria, B.C. demonstrates how the course elements can serve a different subject matter and instructional level.

AB  - In recent decades much attention has been given to the optimization of professional development to support education reform; especially as it relates to science, engineering, technology and mathematics (STEM) fields. Many studies have shown that the most effective STEM professional development programs include active inquiry opportunities that take place over long durations. The Colorado School of Mines (CSM) has developed, and hosts, a professional program that works to address these needs. The "Water-Energy Education for the Next Generation" (WE[superscript 2]NG) is a National Science Foundation funded Research Experience for Teachers (RET). The WE[superscript 2]NG program is a six-week summer training that immerses K-12 educators in state-of-the-art research at CSM through the highly interdisciplinary lens of the water-energy nexus. The WE[superscript 2]NG model also includes industry field trips, content and pedagogy workshops and book club focusing on science communication. Program effectiveness is evaluated through surveys given to participants before, during and after the program. Pre- and post-program surveys indicate that WE[superscript 2]NG supports teacher confidence and growth in teachers of all grade levels and that participant satisfaction outcomes are likely related to the ratio of elementary, middle and high school teacher participants. Surveys given during the program reveal consistently positive feedback and that satisfaction with collaborative program elements is related to program duration. Overall, survey results illustrate that the WE[superscript 2]NG RET program is an effective professional development model for K-12 STEM educators.

AB  - Water quality is an important interdisciplinary environmental topic for project-based learning. An undergraduate summer research internship program at a public minority serving institution engaged environmental science majors in community-based research experiences. The research focused on the field monitoring of water quality for surface water and groundwater in urban areas of New York and New Jersey that have been heavily impacted by industrialization and urbanization. Groups of students collected water samples from the tidal section of the Passaic River and the Hackensack River, as well as the Newark Bay in New Jersey. Groundwater samples were also collected from a sandy coastal aquifer located in the East Shore of Staten Island, New York. Students analyzed water samples using a portable pH-EC meter, a portable colorimeter, or field test kits for various water quality parameters in the field or laboratory. Students prepared and presented research posters in conferences and at a local community event. The water quality monitoring project helped students to develop field and laboratory research skills, quantitative skills, collaboration skills, as well as written and oral communication skills. The research experiences enhanced students' attitudes toward science careers and motivated students to pursue degrees in science. The community-based environmental project can be implemented in various undergraduate science courses focusing on the chemistry of natural waters to facilitate inquiry-driven learning and connect classroom learning to the real world.

AB  - One of the most challenging tasks for teachers in projects is to develop creative ideas. Due to the linear system perspective of education, fostering students' creativity is restricted. However, engineering design and scientific process skills that comprise creativity have an iterative structure. An iterative process-oriented education enables students to engage with questions. First, the current study includes a theoretical framework for the nature of engineering design and its transfer to classroom practices. Second, it provides examples of design-based activities that will contribute to the development of the engineering habits of the mind for teachers. In the study, a design of a future living environment activity that can be planned as a long-term student project is introduced. Then, a student design report and a design evaluation rubric for teachers are shared. In this section, engineering design-based projects are demonstrated in detail. These projects are based on the "One Item, One Material" project idea development strategy proposed by the authors. It is considered that such activities, which are carried out with the understanding of simple-complex science, can trigger the enthusiasm of discovery in students' minds.

AB  - This paper unpacks ambiguities in the field of interdisciplinarity studies (IDS), explores where they come from and how they inhibit consolidation of the field. The paper takes its point of departure in two central fault lines in the literature: the relationship between interdisciplinarity and disciplinarity and the question of whether integration is a necessary prerequisite for interdisciplinarity. Opposite positions on the fault lines are drawn out to identify sources of ambiguities, and to examine whether the positions are irreconcilable - or disagreements that may continue to coexist in a consolidated field. It is argued that if we envisage a consolidated field of IDS, there is a need to develop common ground which calls for scholars of ID to be more explicit about the meanings they ascribe to ID than we see today when the sliding between the epistemological and political dimensions of the field may go unnoticed. It is suggested that whereas ambiguity may be unwanted in the epistemological dimension, it may be quite useful in the political dimension. A systematic comparison of opposite positions offers a common frame of reference for a more productive dialogue between different positions. The analysis shows that as to integration, the difference between opposite positions can be reconciled, whereas in the relation between interdisciplinarity and disciplinarity, the positions are antagonistic and logically exclude each other. The analysis suggests that it is the premise of integration that creates the conditions of possibility for "relabelling" interdisciplinarity and for using the "silo" for disciplines.

AB  - Revisiting the seminal 2010 Nolan and Temple Lang article on the role of computing in the statistics curricula, we discuss several trends that have emerged over the last ten years. The rise of data science has coincided with a broadening audience for learning statistics and using computational packages and tools. It has also increased the need for communication skills. We argue that, for most of this audience, instruction should focus on foundational concepts and the early introduction of different types of data and modern methods through the use of interactive learning environments without programming prerequisites. We then describe Integrated Statistics Learning Environment (ISLE), a web-based e-learning platform and lesson authoring framework for teaching statistics. Built on top of computing and peer-to-peer technology, the platform allows collaborative data analysis and real-time interactions in the classroom. We describe how ISLE contributes to the three key Nolan and Temple Lang components: broadening the statistical computing curriculum, deepening computational reasoning and literacy, and expanding computing with data in the practice of statistics. We then present several advantages of using a computing-integrated environment such as ISLE, including promoting (cross-disciplinary) communication, supporting classroom-focused integrated development environments, and advancing the science of data science.

AB  - This study aims to examine the impact of interdisciplinary computational thinking (CT) skills training on primary school teachers' perceptions of CT skills. The sample of the study consisted of 30 primary school teachers in Istanbul. In this study, where quantitative and qualitative methods were used together, qualitative data were obtained from the teacher identification form. Quantitative data were obtained from the scale for CT skills. After the pre-test was applied to the study group, "CT Skills Training" was applied. During the training, the basic concepts of CT skills and the subskills were covered theoretically and practically. From the quantitative data, the education applied was determined to have had a positive effect on the primary school teachers' perceptions of CT skills. From the qualitative data, it was determined that the participants had a positive opinion about the applied training and thought that they gained skills related to CT.

AB  - This article describes and analyzes the collaborative design of a citizen science research project through co-creation. Three groups of secondary school students and a team of scientists conceived three experiments on human behavior and social capital in urban and public spaces. The study goal is to address how interdisciplinary work and attention to social concerns and needs, as well as the collective construction of research questions, can be integrated into scientific research. The 95 students participating in the project answered a survey to evaluate their perception about the dynamics and tools used in the co-creation process of each experiment, and the five scientists responded to a semi-structured interview. The results from the survey and interviews demonstrate how citizen science can achieve a "co-created" modality beyond the usual "contributory" paradigm, which usually only involves the public or amateurs in data collection stages. This type of more collaborative science was made possible by the adaptation of materials and facilitation mechanisms, as well as the promotion of key aspects in research such as trust, creativity and transparency. The results also point to the possibility of adopting similar co-design strategies in other contexts of scientific collaboration and collaborative knowledge generation.

AB  - The study explored the effects of an interdisciplinary learning approach on developing students' English learning (EL) and computational thinking (CT) through two different game-based learning approaches. A quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in terms of enhancing students' CT knowledge and their EL achievement in an elementary school English as a foreign language learning context. A total of 52 Grade 3 students took part in the experiment, of whom 28 assigned to the experimental group learned with a machine educational robot (machine-ER) board game and 24 assigned to the control group learned with a character educational robot (character-ER) board game. The results indicated that both groups made significant improvements in learning achievement: 1) in EL achievement of learning vocabulary and sentence patterns; 2) in CT concepts, although the machine-ER board game produced a greater increase than the character-ER board game in both language learning achievement and CT knowledge; 3) their learning anxieties were also lower than those of the control group; and 4) the analysis of behavioral patterns also revealed that students playing the machine-ER board game demonstrated better language-learning interaction, while the character-ER board game presented greater CT development in finding solutions.

AB  - Historically there has been a relative dearth of social science research into civic education--even in political science, a discipline that had civic education as one of its founding objectives. This is partly due to the mistaken impression that civics instruction has no effect on civic and political participation, a conclusion that was once conventional wisdom but has since been refuted. More and more evidence has accumulated that well-designed civic education--both formal and informal--has meaningful, long-lasting effects on the civic engagement of young people. Existing research finds four aspects of schooling that affect civic learning and engagement: classroom instruction, extracurricular activities, service learning, and a school's ethos. Furthermore, state-level civics exams can positively affect knowledge about politics and government. The unifying theme that arises from this burgeoning literature is that effective civic education can compensate for a dearth of civic resources in the home and community. However, the renaissance of research into civic education is only just beginning, as more needs to be done. The existing data are too limited, and randomized studies are rare. Truly advancing our understanding of civic education will require a large-scale, multi-method, interdisciplinary effort.

AB  - Given the current threat posed by toxic digital content, preparing students to evaluate online sources cannot be relegated to a single subject area--this instruction should happen across the curriculum. This article focuses on materials designed to teach students to evaluate online information across subject areas. ninth-grade biology and world geography teachers taught a series of curriculum-embedded lessons based on the following design principles: (a) Focus on a core question and strategy; (b) engage students in evaluating real online content; (c) feature cognitive apprenticeship and formative assessment; and (d) support teacher learning. We examine whether these lessons helped students become more skilled evaluators of online content. Pretest/posttest data (N =574) showed statistically significant growth in students' ability to evaluate the credibility of online content. We analyze the role played by the curriculum design principles in this interdisciplinary intervention and explore implications for future initiatives.

AB  - The STEAMTEACH (STEAM Education for Teaching Professionalism) project works with teacher trainers to develop a program of Transcultural STEAM Professional Development for in- and pre-service teachers. Following a literature review, a semi-structured questionnaire then interviews approach was used to elicit current practice, challenges for teachers and recommendations from Austrian teacher trainers. These recommendations were then compared with and supported by STEAM academic literature. It was found that none of the institutions offered a STEAM approach and it does not appear in the curriculum. Indeed, this fact is the primary challenge to overcome. Recommendations were that teachers should work in multidisciplinary, supportive, collaborative groups and networks. Problem and project-based learning were identified as key learning methodologies. A mix of physical and on-line working synchronously and asynchronously was recommended for online professional development because teachers can participate irrespective of time and place. Educational technology can support collaboration, and also 'plug and play' technologies including game-based learning can be inserted into an overall STEAM approach. The affective factor was judged essential for students and teachers.

AB  - The HEI-ICI project involves cooperation between the University of Eastern Finland (UEF) and three African partners. The main aim of the project, now in its fourth year, has been to develop education in health sciences and to improve the quality of teaching. The target has been to develop the skills of selected junior faculty from the Public Health departments, library and IT centres at partner universities. The data was collected during the project in 2010-2014. Written and visual material was analysed using deductive content analysis. The main obstacles researchers were faced with while working in the project have been cultural: the project encouraged different cultures--not only European and African but also pan-African--to meet and work together. This novel approach to learning and teaching is based on the concept of cooperation, collaboration and trust between all of the participating partners; its foundation is the full ownership by the less developed Southern partner institutions.

AB  - A recent scientific discipline, bioinformatics, defined as using informatics for the study of biological problems, is now a requirement for the study of biological sciences. Bioinformatics has become such a powerful and popular discipline that several academic institutions have created programs in this field, allowing students to become specialized. However, biology students who are not involved in a bioinformatics program also need a solid toolbox of bioinformatics software and skills. Therefore, we have developed a completely online bioinformatics course for non-bioinformaticians, entitled "BIF-1901 Introduction à la bio-informatique et à ses outils" ("Introduction to bioinformatics and bioinformatics tools"), given by the Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Bioinformatics of Université Laval (Quebec City, Canada). This course requires neither a bioinformatics background nor specific skills in informatics. The underlying main goal was to produce a completely online up-to-date bioinformatics course, including practical exercises, with an intuitive pedagogical framework. The course, BIF-1901, was conceived to cover the three fundamental aspects of bioinformatics: (1) informatics, (2) biological sequence analysis, and (3) structural bioinformatics. This article discusses the content of the modules, the evaluations, the pedagogical framework, and the challenges inherent to a multidisciplinary, fully online course.

AB  - Developing an online learning community can help to improve student success. This presents a challenge as the student cohort is often time-limited and shifting in composition before a module starts. The continued evaluation and development of an online preparatory website for the new, year one module S112 -- "Science: concepts and practice" is reported. Evaluation of the site in 2017-18 showed high levels of student satisfaction with the resources, though very little engagement with the asynchronous forum. Therefore, improvements before the October 2018 module start centred on increasing student engagement on the forum: Firstly, tutors moderating the forums were tasked with developing several optional scientific tasks for staged release to generate student discussion. Secondly, volunteer peer mentors from the 2017-18 presentation were recruited and trained as "student buddies" to provide non-academic advice and support. Student engagement increased markedly prior to the October 2018 module. The clearest emergent theme from tutors who moderated the forums was that students were seeking to establish a study community, rather than obtain subject-specific advice. Student response to the buddies was positive, with students more willing to ask questions of the buddies than of the tutor moderators. Data for S112 show that registrations at module start increased by 23.5% from 2017 to 2018, and early withdrawals (14 days after module start) dropped by 2%. Our results provide ideas for building online student engagement, particularly in scenarios where students may come and go, and have little available time: for example, bridging gaps in time or academic readiness, whether by blended or distance learning.

Participation in both policymaking and the generation of knowledge has traditionally been dominated by over-represented groups, drawing on the limited expertise of professionals and practitioners. However, an increasing body of research indicates that the inclusion of individuals and communities living with disadvantage enhances the effectiveness of policymaking, delivery of services and generation of research. With a particular focus on the social sciences, this paper argues that the business of Universities - teaching, learning and research - must have a greater regard for the local community and the voluntary, community, faith and social enterprise sector (VCFSE) if they are to play a role in bringing about radical social change. This is even more crucial in the face of wicked problems, such as entrenched poverty, the mental health crisis in young people and the climate crisis, that require a multi-disciplinary, multi-organisational and multi-actor approach to generating solutions capable of disrupting the status quo. Drawing on the principles of coproduction, critical pedagogy and social pedagogy, and rejecting the concept of 'employability', this paper will argue that Universities need to pay more regard to local knowledge and the lived experience of those communities most affected by the consequences of wicked problems. This would promote a community-centric approach to research and pedagogy - and the nurturing of graduates that do not just 'fit into' the capitalist culture of consumerism that is killing us. Otherwise the potential for social change will be limited, the environment will continue to degenerate and social inequalities will persist.

AB  - The article describes a science activity designed to increase students' knowledge and awareness of the spread of COVID-19. It helps students achieve scientific literacy through improving their views about the nature of science and their argumentation skills. It also promotes students' engagement in scientific practices such as modelling, collecting data, analysing it, and representing it in tables and graphs. The activity aims to simulate the spread of any infectious disease. It adopts the 5E approach, which is integrated into the context of inquiry, argumentation and nature of science. Integration of science and mathematics is also an added value of the activity.

AB  - Higher Education as a Field of Study is multi-disciplinary in its origin. Given the relative youth of the field, as it was only founded less than 130 years ago, it does not yet have standalone theories or philosophies as the scholarship in the field frequently borrows from its epistemological, methodological, and philosophical ideas from more established social science disciplines and fields. The objective of this paper is to use an historical exploration of higher education in North America to articulate both higher education's foundation, purpose and philosophy. This analysis will aid in categorizing the types of questions the public and government ask of higher education and how higher education as a field of scholarship can impact the future of the governance, pedagogy, the nature of research, and university's societal role. The cumulative effect of this work is ultimately moving this field of study to the center stage of the discussions around higher education.

AB  - Increasing productivity in educational systems is of great importance. Researchers are keen to predict the academic performance of students; this is done to enhance the overall productivity of educational system by effectively identifying students whose performance is below average. This universal concern has been combined with data science leading to the creation of an interdisciplinary research area called Educational Data Mining. One of the recent issues which has been addressed by researchers is training generalizable models from different aspects such as gender, major, geography and etc. Therefore, in this research we use machine learning methods to predict student's performance, emphasizing on training generalizable models from geographical aspect. For this purpose, a questionnaire containing 37 questions was designed, through which 536 answers were collected, including 111 international and 425 domestic answers. According to the literature, student performance is mostly determined based on the GPA (grade point average) of the entire course. In this research, information about the GPA of respondents in undergraduate and graduate courses was collected in the form of three classes. After a final review of the models employed in previous studies, the main models selected and used for classification purposes included SVM, CNN, Adaboost, RF, SVM, and DT. Feature selection is performed using XGBoost, random forest, as well as SVML1. The main issue investigated in this study is the generalizability of the models trained on domestic (Iranian) data and tested on international data (non-Iranian). Experimental results show that the best models trained with specific dataset collected in this research had generalizability comparing to base models' outcomes which were trained and tested on domestic data. Meanwhile, Random forest and CNN models shows the best performance with the average of accuracy and F-score of 73.5 and 68.5, respectively.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore how a health-based informal science education course, as part of an elementary undergraduate teacher preparation program, influenced pre-service teachers' ideas about formal and informal science teaching and learning. Additionally, the study explored how the course impacted their understandings of the value of bridging informal science to supplement formal instruction. Qualitative study data were gathered through two (mid- and end-of-semester) focus group interviews with five pre-service teachers enrolled in a health-based informal science course. Analysis of data indicated that the inclusion of informal science education experiences during PST preparation has the potential to support novice teachers' developing ideas about science teaching and learning including ways to connect science to students' lives and make science engaging and meaningful. Findings are reported in four key themes that emerged from the data: (a) formal teacher preparation and informal education, (b) connections between formal and informal science education, (c) personal and professional collaborations, and (d) benefits of informal science education.

AB  - The necessity to learn competence for collaborative knowledge work during higher education (HE) is accepted widely, but continued work is required to explicate how to define and assess such competence. In this article, the development and validation of a questionnaire for assessing the development of collaborative knowledge work competence is based on object-bound collaborative knowledge creation practices. In total, 546 students responded to a questionnaire on Collaborative Knowledge Practices (CKP). The data were analysed for measurement invariance for two groups of HE students in media engineering and life sciences. Seven scales of the CKP were found to measure course-related learning of collaboration, integration of personal and collective efforts, development through feedback, persistent development of knowledge objects, understanding of different disciplines and related expertise, interdisciplinary collaboration, and using digital technology. The CKP questionnaire scales can be used as a generic self-evaluation tool for students on course-based learning outcomes.

AB  - Complementing the aims of problem-based inquiry, a pedagogical approach called design thinking (DT) has students grapple with issues that require a creative redefinition and reimagining of solutions akin to professional skills of designers, who consider conflicting priorities and complex negotiations to arrive at a solution to an ill-defined problem. This article aims to synthesize the limited existing literature on the use of DT in the K-12 classroom, share two exemplars of DT in action in Grades 3-5 so that science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) educators, teacher educators, researchers, and other stakeholders can visualize how it can take shape in the elementary classroom, followed by concluding remarks on DT. The DT framework provides an exciting avenue for teaching more than simply the content areas of STEAM, it provides a vehicle through which a true transdisciplinary learning experience can occur--where students are passionately invested in solving problems as they strive to make the world a better place.

AB  - For United States of America (USA) and other developed countries, science achievement gaps begin to emerge in elementary and primary school. Such gaps between USA student groups typically are connected to socio-economic status (SES) and issues such as students still learning the English language. Through an experimental design, this National Science Foundation funded study explores how integrating the arts into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curriculum and leading with a more STEAMfirst approach (e.g., curriculum which integrates science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) might provide more equitable science learning opportunities for elementary or primary grade level students. More specifically, the project's research efforts seek to also examine how integrating the arts into science instruction might help emerging bilingual (EB) students who are simultaneously learning the English language and science. Although results provide somewhat conflicting findings of statistical significance with small to moderate effect sizes, outcomes provide initial evidence that leading with STEAM science instruction before STEM efforts can be beneficial to early readers, and for EB students this benefit is magnified. As the title of this study suggest, sometimes finding nothing is something.

AB  - Contribution: A technical course in a multidisciplinary university program has to provide high-level skills, with limited lecturing hours and student background. This article investigates the principles for its design and reports about a study case. Background: The overall course organization needs to address specific learning targets and teaching techniques, different from those used in traditional courses on the topic. Research Question: A stepwise strategy assists a principled design that allows dynamic, long-term improvements. Methodology: The evaluation of its applicability requires a years-long record of historical data. The article studies the evolution of a course over six years using simple monitoring techniques: surveys and rubric-based examinations. Findings: Monitoring emerges as an essential feature for course evolution: a focused examination provides the best results, while institutional, wide-spectrum surveys appear to be of little help.

AB  - We presented one new coach's development during a K-12 STEM integration initiative in order to explore how coaches develop professional identities for coaching. Madison, a former mathematics educator, partnered with science teachers for 1 year in order to co-develop and implement STEM curriculum. Transcripts of coaching conversations, written reflection data, assignments from a graduate-level coaching course, and interviews were analyzed using three-phased qualitative methods. Findings suggest that a new coach approximated practice similar to new teachers; relied on existing professional identities when constructing new coaching identities; and the local, global, and institutional affinity groups for STEM coaching both informed and disrupted coaching identity development. The process by which new coaches develop contextually dependent and discipline-specific identities for coaching has implications for the success of STEM coaching efforts.

AB  - This case study piloted an interdisciplinary Problem-Based Learning course, utilizing Hung's (2006) 3C3R model. We explain the course design, curriculum, and implementation. We collected qualitative written questionnaires from students who participated in the course to investigate their learning experiences. As a result, students shed light on lessons they learned throughout the course, which led to the creation of a lessons learned guide for future instructors. This guide encompasses 8 lessons that were gleaned by both qualitative student feedback and instructor reflections from the course. These lessons include allocating in-class time to work on projects, using a modular approach in the course design, presenting students with real-life problems related to the topic of the course, providing in-class case studies for students to get acquainted with examples of previous work, grouping students from diverse academic backgrounds together when possible, utilizing online and librarian resources, surveying the classroom on their comfort with self-directed learning beforehand, and including a self-reflection piece at the end of the course.

AB  - An interdisciplinary and pluralistic approach to teaching and learning has been proposed as one solution to the lack of a consensus definition of sustainable development (SD). For teachers, such an approach requires an awareness of the interconnections among different dimensions of SD and their underlying value-based assumptions. In this article, we investigate whether higher education teachers' conceptions of SD are consistent with these aims. We present the results of our interviews with five university teachers who are experienced in interdisciplinary SD in Finland. Our findings show that despite the teachers' rich conceptions of cultural sustainability, including a variety of topics, concepts and value questions, their understanding of economic sustainability is rather limited and sketchy. We suggest that universities support the teachers' social and peer learning based on reflections on unclear concepts and emerging SD ideas.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a prominent topic in K-12 education recently. However, pedagogical design has remained a major challenge, especially among young learners. Guided by the Zone of Proximal Development theory and AI education research literature, this design-based study proposes an analogy-based pedagogical approach to support AI teaching and learning in upper primary education. This pedagogical approach is centered on human-AI comparison, where humans are gradually shifted from an analogue to a contrast to make visible the attributes, mechanisms, and processes of AI. To evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experimental study with mixed methods was conducted. The quantitative comparison shows that the participants in the experimental group learning with the analogy-based pedagogical approach significantly outperformed their peers with the conventional direct instructional approach in all three dimensions of AI knowledge, skills, and ethical awareness. Qualitative analyses further reveal its pedagogical benefits, including demystifying AI through relatable and engaging learning, supporting student comprehension and skill mastery, and nurturing critical thinking and attitudes. The analogy-based approach contributes to the field of K-12 AI education with an age-appropriate, child-friendly pedagogical approach. Notably, AI education should prioritize teaching for student understanding, and AI should be recognized as an independent subject with interdisciplinary applications.

AB  - Reading is one of the main skills to be learned and used in schools and through the entire life of an individual. Its crucial importance made reading one of the central topics in different academic disciplines such as education, psychology, linguistic and neuroscience. Advances in multidisciplinary approaches to and studies of reading gave us the reason to talk about the science of reading. Improvement in research into reading during the last century reveals the fact that different approaches emphasized the importance of partially different aspects of reading skills. Different approaches presented sound arguments for different priorities in teaching and learning of reading. For some decades ago strong dichotomic arguments were so sharp that in the United States the reading literature talked about 'the reading wars'. During the recent decades, the debate of reading and approaches to reading, reading skills and reading processes have changed. Studies of reading presented different arguments for partially different priorities. The Reading Teacher (RT) has for many decades been the one of the most important arenas for the presentation of new findings, ideas, arguments, and trends. Our present corpus-based study captured the frequent collocations and their usage in the RT publications -- 952 articles comprising 3 548 008 words - during the last decade, 2012-2021. TreeTagger was used for part-of-speech tagging and CQPWeb/CWB framework was employed as the corpus interface in the analysis process. The findings clearly revealed that "reading comprehension" was the most frequently used collocation, and it has never weakened its position in the RT publications in the last decade. While instructional activities and processes like 'shared reading', 'during reading', 'while reading', and 'after reading' were given considerable attention, 'before reading' was almost forgotten. Findings also show that linguistic diversity among students, particularly in the US, also made an impact on the emerging of new topics and thus frequency of concepts like bilingual, multilingual, translanguaging, and coaching. Findings related to the ascending and descending trends reading collocations in RT publications regarding other aspects of reading, teaching of reading, and reading processes are discussed and some ideas for future research are presented.

AB  - This experiment combines analytical techniques of solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with easily relatable and accessible plant volatile chemistry (floral and vegetative scents of local/available plants). The biosynthesis and structure of these chemicals are of interest in the areas of organic chemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology. This laboratory exercise is well-suited for a broad range of cross-disciplinary topics in chemistry and biology courses. The methods described here could be used to expose undergraduate chemistry students to broad aspects of biological volatile chemistry in plants, and alternatively, to expose undergraduate biology students to analytical chemistry techniques useful in the study of plant biology and plant-insect interactions.

AB  - Interdisciplinary teaching in STEM is often seen as a collaboration of different subjects teaching a common theme. This view undermines successful interdisciplinary approaches that can be deployed in a single class. Two examples of interdisciplinary math lessons, using pie charts and bar charts respectively, will be used to demonstrate how this can be realized. The potential for deeper integration among the subjects involved will also be analyzed.

AB  - Design of Mechanism is a standard subject in Mechatronics and Mechanical Engineering majors. Different methods and tools are used by lecturers to teach the subject. In this work, we investigate the impact on the competencies development by implementing a project-based learning methodology in a mechanism course. For this, we analyze the performance of students from two different groups. The first group is taught in a traditional fashion developing a final project just related to the discipline, and the second group is taught in a multidisciplinary context where the final goal is to develop a complex project where the mechanisms subject is one complementary subject with the others. The development of engineering competencies, declared for this course, is presented for both groups through the evaluation of different aspects; also, a survey of satisfaction from the students of both groups is presented. Overall, the results show that the multidisciplinary project-based learning method, having a nonacademic training partner as sponsor and solving a real nonacademic project, improves the development of competencies related to practical applications and increases the motivation and appreciation of the student towards the mechanism learning discipline.

AB  - The integration of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, also referred to as integrative STEM education, is a relatively new interdisciplinary teaching technique that incorporates an engineering design-based learning approach with mathematics, science, technology, and engineering education (Sanders, 2010, 2012, 2013; Wells, 2010, 2013). Over the past 11 years, 475 teachers and administrators, representing kindergarten through eighth grade teachers and elementary school administrators from 7 school districts in South Carolina, have participated in an Integrative STEM Education Institute. In this Institute, participants developed knowledge and skills to create and implement integrative STEM education activities for use in their classrooms. Participants learned how to incorporate problem-based and project-based learning that helps students work in groups to develop cross-curriculum skills. The purpose of this article was to evaluate the immediate and long-term effectiveness of the Institute. Quantitative survey data from pre-post surveys immediately revealed a statistically significant increase in self-efficacy regarding the Institute's learning objectives. In addition, a survey was sent to alumni from the 2012-2015 Institutes. The results from this survey revealed that a significant number of alumni felt empowered through the Institute to implement integrative STEM education in their classrooms and build sustainable integrative STEM education programs at their schools following attendance at the Institute.

AB  - Designing a lesson plan for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is an important skill in STEM teaching. It requires systematic training that begins at the pre-service stage. It is particularly difficult to help pre-service teachers (PSTs) develop their ability to design an integrated STEM learning unit that features competence-oriented, interdisciplinary, student-centered, authentic, and collaborative learning. Through three rounds of iterative design, this study aimed to develop a technology-enhanced STEM PST training solution. Each round of design sought to address practical issues that had been identified during the implementation of the training in the previous stage. When developing the program, we articulated five principles that guided our design, the final outcome of which was an online teacher training environment integrated with a visual learning design tool and a learning analytics function. We discuss the implications of our research in terms of recommended design principles for STEM PST training, and we suggest directions for future research on the cultivation of STEM learning design expertise.

AB  - Awareness of faculty research interests is an important aspect of a subject librarian's responsibilities. This paper illustrates the potential of Voyant Tools, an application in wide use among digital humanities researchers, to reveal word patterns in the research output of applied science faculty. A corpus of recent article citations from Web of Science from two engineering departments was obtained, and the articles' title field was extracted and uploaded to the application. The exercise indicated that articles on fuel cells dominates the research output of one department, and articles on optical coherence tomography dominates the other. Both the corpus of citations and its visualizations in Voyant Tools contribute to librarians' knowledge of their departments and historical spending patterns on specialized resources. This knowledge can be used in professional practice, including collection development and instruction. As academic subject areas become increasingly complex and multidisciplinary, this paper encourages librarians to engage with Voyant Tools to better understand the specialized language and concepts of these evolving fields.

AB  - Our paper describes the design and delivery of an online interdisciplinary social science research methods course (ISRM) for graduate students in sociology, education, social work, and public administration. Collaborative activities and learning took place in two types of computer-mediated learning environments: a closed Blackboard course management system and a public facing "openly-networked connected learning" environment designed to facilitate cross-discipline connections, student engagement, and digital fluency. A course formative assessment based on student feedback and instructors' reflections informed the lessons learned about the design and delivery of the course. Our assessment suggests that many of the connected learning goals can be met through the closed course management system rather than through the open platform.

AB  - Literacy standards (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices & Council of Chief State School Officers in Common core state standards: English language arts standards, 2010) and best practices from Institute of Education Sciences practice guides (e.g., Baker et al. in Teaching academic content and literacy to English learners in elementary and middle school (NCEE 2014-4012), National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance, 2014; Kamil et al. in Improving adolescent literacy: effective classroom and intervention practices (NCEE 2008-4027), National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance, 2008) encourage content-area teachers to use text reading to improve vocabulary and comprehension for middle grade students. Despite these strong research recommendations and various literacy initiatives, previous research studies have found a persistent pattern of limited text use (i.e., reading and learning from text) in content-area classrooms, thus limiting students' opportunities to develop advanced literacy skills. This study extends the research base on text use in middle school by presenting findings of a questionnaire administered to 124 middle school teachers and offering insights on how text is typically used in English language arts, science, and social studies classes. Teachers responded to questions about the duration and frequency of text use, as well as reading formats, reading materials (including textbooks), and challenges to utilizing text reading more often. Findings suggest that while most teachers indicated a desire to increase the amount of reading in their classes, they cited challenges such as students' difficulty with reading and a preference for using other types of teaching activities. Teachers also cited the need for higher-quality texts, and science and social studies teachers, in particular, reported dissatisfaction with and limited use of textbooks. Implications for practice include providing professional development focused on selecting appropriate texts for instruction, using text reading routines that enhance purposeful learning, and integrating reading practices into existing instructional delivery practices.

AB  - Taking the establishment of structured doctoral programmes in Germany as an example, this paper focuses on how knowledge production in certain academic fields reshapes their doctoral education in a widely changing policy context. Based on case studies of eight graduate schools in three research fields, namely economics, life sciences, and literature--cultural studies, this paper illustrates the different components of structured doctoral programmes in the above three fields, and analyses the heterogeneity in the motivation and pathways of doctoral education reform. This paper concludes that the structured doctoral programmes in Germany manifest several characteristics of the new mode of knowledge production. However, these characteristics have very different implications for different academic fields, which should be taken into consideration when making relevant policies.

AB  - Background: Secondary school teachers sometimes teach and assess material outside their specialisms for reasons including staff shortages or the growing popularity of the interdisciplinary courses. We hypothesised that teacher-assessors with different subject specialisms may differ in their interpretations of frequently used words in teaching and assessment, such as 'analyse' and 'evaluate'. Differing interpretations of these seemingly generic command words are worthy of investigation because they may have implications for the clarity and success of teaching and assessment. Purpose: The aim of this small-scale study was to identify and analyse teacher-assessors' interpretative differences of command words commonly used in teaching and assessment in order to draw out implications for students' learning and assessment outcomes. Method: Written definitions for five common command words (analyse, evaluate, review, synthesise and argue) were obtained from six published sources and also from nine experienced teacher-assessors in England covering seven subjects. A directed qualitative content analysis was conducted, entailing comparisons across individual definitions and across the humanities and sciences. Findings: For all five command words, definitions were found to vary in both conceptual complexity and subject specificity, sometimes within the same subject. Fundamentally different concepts were identified for 'review' (which may or may not entail making a judgement about material) and 'argue' (which may or may not focus on reasoning). This could be an important cause of confusion for some students and may limit the depth of teaching and understanding for others. Furthermore, such differences could reduce agreement among assessors and undermine the appropriateness of the inferences drawn from the outcomes of assessments. Conclusion: This small-scale investigation highlights the importance of building shared understandings of assessment criteria. Although assessor standardisation is the norm and occurs via formal procedures within large examination boards, the emphasis on it may be considerably weaker in less regulated teacher-assessor contexts. Further research could usefully focus on training and support the needs of non-specialist teachers and interdisciplinary course developers, strengthening communities of practice.

AB  - Knowledge transfer refers to the (1) recognition of overlap in past learning and new academic goals, (2) recollection of previously learned information, and (3) application of past learning in a new context or discipline. Promoting effective transfer remains a notorious challenge for chemistry educators. To address this need, the step back, translate, and extend (SBTE) instructional framework was designed based on principles derived from cognitive psychology and social cognitive theory. A comprehensive description of the SBTE framework is presented here, alongside a qualitative analysis of student interviews, revealing the long-term impact of a transfer intervention (OrgoPrep) designed using the SBTE framework. This six week summer preparatory program facilitating the transition from general chemistry was previously found to improve course grades in organic chemistry. The present study further elucidates the mechanisms through which the SBTE framework undergirding OrgoPrep strengthened transfer. Specifically, improvements in students' application skills were the most prominent, regardless of prior success in general chemistry. Of note, the SBTE framework also altered student learning approaches to prioritize more problem-solving, presumably inducing the long-lasting benefits of the intervention. Another key feature of the SBTE framework is its emphasis on incorporating instructional techniques for raising self-efficacy. Student feedback confirmed the impacts of the SBTE framework on several contributors to self-efficacy: mastery experiences (i.e., offering opportunities for successful problem-solving), vicarious experiences (i.e., offering opportunities for observing peers and instructors engage in successful problem-solving), and physiological and emotional states (i.e., creating a low-stress learning environment). Although the program assessed in this study focused on the transition from general chemistry to organic chemistry, the SBTE framework is well-poised to serve as a blueprint for designing knowledge transfer interventions across many disciplines.

AB  - Today, the engineering landscape is continually changing, and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have a responsibility to design curricula that address the growing demands of various industry sectors. Likewise, the roles and responsibilities of an engineer are evolving; requiring a further broadening of the current engineering curriculum. As a profession, engineering draws upon broad interdisciplinary knowledge, and when training twenty-first-century engineers, universities should follow a more comprehensive teaching and learning approach, with a focus on both technical and soft skills including the integration of leadership into engineering curricula. However, the spectrum of engineering leadership is not well-defined. Leadership is one of the most widely sought-after skills in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) industries; it is, therefore, clear that more investigation needs to be carried out into this area of engineering pedagogy. One of the most distinct gaps in the literature is that there is little or no consensus on what approaches should be undertaken to integrate leadership in engineering courses by those in academia. This paper seeks to shed light on some of these gaps, with the primary objective of the evaluation of the current state of leadership education using a nation-wide sample of BEng Electronic Engineering course structures and contents at Russell Group universities in the UK. It highlights the case study of the University of York, where there is a strong emphasis on the integration of engineering leadership and management skills within the current BEng Electronic Engineering course structure.

AB  - Background: Aphasia, a common consequence of stroke, which affects both communication and social functioning, and in turn, quality of life, is on the rise due to increases in stroke prevalence and survival rate. The rehabilitation of post-stroke aphasia primarily falls within the purview of speech-language pathology and research supports the effectiveness of such services. However, provision of aphasia rehabilitation services in sub-Saharan Africa is associated with challenges. Aims: This study aimed to examine rehabilitation services for individuals with post-stroke aphasia in Ghana by exploring the roles of the stakeholder groups involved in the assessment and treatment of post-stroke aphasia in Ghana, as well as the challenges they encounter in providing or identifying services. The stakeholder groups included educational institutions, interdisciplinary healthcare professionals, and family caregivers of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. Methods & Procedures: A qualitative case study approach was used to collect and integrate from multiple sources data such as demographic information, interview responses and program syllabi to develop a holistic image. Fifteen respondents from the stroke and speech therapy units at Komfo Anokye and Korle-Bu Teaching Hospitals, University of Ghana, and University of Health and Allied Sciences, Ghana were purposively sampled. Interview questions were developed and centred on aphasia education and training, knowledge of speech-language pathology services, speech-language pathology service delivery, access to speech-language pathology services, challenges in both delivery and access to speech-language pathology services and suggestions for improving speech-language pathology services. In-person and virtual interviews were conducted after demographic information was collected. Interviews were analysed thematically, and demographic information and program syllabi were triangulated with the interview data collected. Outcomes & Results: All stakeholder groups identified concerns with current aphasia services in Ghana. Issues raised included the insufficient number of speech-language pathologists, lack of awareness of speech-language pathology services for post-stroke aphasia (among healthcare professionals and the public), absence of aphasia management information and clinical training in educational programming, lack of interest in speech-language pathology training programs, financial challenges, spiritual and traditional beliefs and geographic barriers (i.e., speech-language pathology services are currently available in only a few cities). Conclusions & Implications: These findings emphasised the need to improve post-stroke aphasia rehabilitation in Ghana. The process of data collection itself educated respondents on the importance of post-stroke aphasia rehabilitation, and by identifying barriers, strategies to improving services, such as designing standardised aphasia assessments for the Ghanaian context, can now be initiated.

AB  - It has long been recognised that a key element in improving student transition, retention and success in higher education is cross-institutional consistency and unity of action among disparate academic, policy and support units. However, transferring this principle into practice often requires overcoming departmental silos, negotiating shared understandings of key concepts, and establishing patterns of cross-institutional collaboration in spaces where this may have been lacking. This study examines the effect of a program of supported communities of practice among teaching academics that sought to improve the culture of learning and teaching in a large science, health and engineering faculty in an Australian university. We found indications that these communities of practice promoted collaboration by functioning as loci of cross-institutional consultation and coordination, providing the basis for an enhanced student experience. We interpret this finding through the lens of Bronfenbrenner's ecological model of development, and propose an approach based on academic communities of practice as a way of building cross-institutional unity of action and making the student experience everybody's business.

AB  - While a mutually agreed-upon definition of STEM education remains elusive, there is no doubt that instructional models and ideas put forward with the STEM label have had a tremendous impact on thinking, debate, and practice in schools worldwide. At issue is the degree to which some or all the STEM disciplines must be taught in a concurrent or combined way, so curricula can qualify for the STEM education label. In this manuscript, we unpack the various perspectives of STEM that have evolved recently and propose the acronym I-STEM for any integrated instructional blending of the individual STEM elements. We examine some problematic issues related to what seems a premature acceptance of I-STEM and conclude with some suggestions for the science education community relative to the emergence of STEM. This article is written from the perspective of improving the teaching and learning of science, and if I-STEM can be shown to further advance that aim, it would be foolish not to embrace it. However, if I-STEM is being promoted on the tenuous empirical and philosophical foundation we see presently, we must slow down. We must ensure that we really want this revolution in science education to succeed. We worry that science content and process learning opportunities might too easily be lost in a rush to teach STEM in a manner that gives substantial instructional time and energy to all of the disciplines regardless of the context of the classroom in which it is taught.

AB  - This paper describes an investigation into student reasoning about potential energy in the context of introductory electrostatics. Similar incorrect reasoning patterns emerged both in written questions administered after relevant instruction and in one-on-one interviews. These reasoning patterns are also prevalent in responses to questions posed about gravitational potential energy in the context of universal gravitation in introductory mechanics. This finding is relevant for interdisciplinary research, because many courses in multiple disciplines first introduce the concept of electric potential energy in analogy to gravitational potential energy. The results suggest that in introductory courses students do not gain an understanding of potential energy that is sufficiently robust to apply in more advanced physics courses or in disciplines other than physics, in which students must frequently reason with energy in the context of interactions between atoms and molecules.

AB  - This work is part of a research project that aims to enhance engineering students' learning of how to apply mathematics in modelling activities of real-world situations, through the construction (design and programming) of videogames. We want also for students to relate their mathematical knowledge with other disciplines (e.g., physics, computer science or electronics) and adapt it as necessary, as is usually part of the practice of an engineer. The design of the activities, and their implementation, is framed in the constructionism educational paradigm, which considers that learning is facilitated through engagement in the construction of external objects. Each activity integrates three aspects: the mathematization of a physical or digital system, programming simulations and the construction of a videogame. Students work both individually and collaboratively, and record their progress in a logbook. Here, we present the work carried out by six university engineering students during an activity that required building a videogame where a virtual mobile robot has to navigate a maze; this required the modelling of combinational logic circuits, which in turn needed Boolean algebra and the simplification of logic equations. The programming of the videogame involved brainstorming and experimentation in a meaningful and motivating activity, where students were able to apply the theoretical mathematical knowledge in the design of the real-world project (in this case of a digital systems model). We found that students gained insights and expertise on how to apply their interdisciplinary knowledge and skills in different contexts related to the practice of engineering, within the videogame design (e.g., they were able to apply their mathematical and technical skills for developing functional simulations of mobile robots, and even include aesthetic and narrative features).

AB  - Information about the overall documentary filmmaking process is available; however, there is a lack of literature and educational resources about how to conduct subject research and data collection. As documentary filmmaking becomes an increasingly democratic endeavor due to technology, and information distribution and education use increases, there is a corresponding need for quality resources to support this essential step. In this study, a content-rich, technology-enhanced, online instructional module that was designed and developed in another study to guide and assist beginner documentary filmmakers with subject research and data collection, was implemented and evaluated by the target audience. This module featured five filmmaking tips summarizing professional documentary filmmakers' wisdom and expertise with subject research and data collection. Motivational and instructional models served as frameworks to inform and guide the study's learning design process. The quantitative and qualitative findings, field notes and observations provided data triangulation. After analysis and interpretation were completed, the results significantly confirmed the module had a positive, educational impact on the target audience and accomplished its purpose. This module addressed the lack of resources and utilized consultation of experts in content design and development to improve the creativity and production of beginner documentary filmmakers. This project successfully merged learning sciences theory and instructional design with humanities and arts research. It will contribute to the literature of documentary film research studies, the fields of instructional design and education, and the humanities. It has significant potential to influence and impact the broad possibilities of innovative, interdisciplinary research design and collaboration.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to evaluate the current situation of education for sustainable development, climate change education and environmental education in a nationwide context. Methodologically, this study calls for more research to go beyond case studies and take a similar approach to examine university curricula and facilitate cross-country comparisons. Design/methodology/approach: This paper examines the status of climate and sustainability curricula in Taiwan's higher education system. Using the course catalog for the 2020-2021 academic year, the authors constructed a unique data set that includes 1,827 courses at 29 major universities in Taiwan. In each institution, the authors search for course titles that include "climate," "sustainable/sustainability" and "environment/environmental" as keywords and code the courses according to their disciplines. Findings: The finding highlights the variations across institutional types and subject matters. Public universities have an average of 4.94 related courses per 1,000 students, whereas private universities have only 3.13. In general, the relevant courses are more concentrated in the STEM and bioscience fields. The curricula, however, are seriously constrained by the disciplinary structure and foster few transdisciplinary perspectives. Originality/value: The authors seek to go beyond case studies and offer one of the most comprehensive curricula samples at the national level. Taiwan adds an important data point, as the current literature focuses heavily on the USA and Europe.

AB  - This article invites a discussion about the inclusion of issues on gender and sexualities in the curriculum of five different interdisciplinary undergraduate courses that focus on the formation of educators (Arts, Languages, Mathematics and Computing, Humanistics and Nature Sciences) at Universidade Federal do Sul da Bahia, in Brazil. The analytical methodology is the autobiographic experience, based on the Benjaminian storyteller, and the results are constituted by this experience under analysis within a narrative organized in three moments: (1) the discussions within a group of professors of these courses about the inclusion of such issues in the curriculum; (2) the construction of study plans; and (3) the experiences in the classroom. The narrated process shows that the issues on gender and sexualities, from a scientific perspective (gender and queer studies, and feminisms) are incipient on these courses, unknown to the students, and a challenge to the school. In this sense, the experience influenced some change into the reality of these courses, by including specific topics in the curriculum that dialogue directly with the educational process.

AB  - With support from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Merced Anomaterials Center for Energy and Sensing (MACES) was launched in the summer of 2015 at the University of California Merced (UC Merced). MACES is a research and education center, focused on creating innovative materials-enabled solutions for energy and sensing-related space applications. The center established its MACES Undergraduate Research Fellowship Program to provide training and professional development opportunities for students, specifically aimed at groups traditionally underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and math. This program consisted of Academic Year and Summer components that integrate research experience, mentoring and workshops on topics ranging from presentation skills to career preparation. The program engaged students from varied backgrounds, more than half of whom were from underrepresented groups, and provided them with tools that enabled greater confidence, expanded career perspectives, and enhanced conceptual and interdisciplinary knowledge. This article details the Academic Year and Summer program components and outlines the impact of respective activities on student participants.

AB  - In recent years, neuroscience and brain-based approaches to education have started to feature prominently in the rationale for radical educational reform, both in terms of policy and practice. Revelations about what way the brain works, it seems, is a common point of interest for neuroscience and education alike. Out of these common interests there are now entire disciplines in their own right, such as 'mind, brain and education' and 'neuroeducation', which are collaborative disciplines formed at the boundaries of common points of interest between the brain sciences in general and education. This paper seeks to examine the credibility of the science inherent in this collaboration, with a particular example found in the guise of the Revised Northern Ireland Curriculum, devised and implemented from 2003 onwards by the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA). The paper will also invoke a philosophical notion known as the mereological fallacy, to offer a conceptual critique of the curricular changes in Northern Ireland.

AB  - Smartphone technology has the potential to make heritage science accessible to museums, individual collectors, and educators. Infrared reflectography (IRR) is a nondestructive analysis method used by museums to gain information about the provenance, history, and aging of artworks. This paper introduces a highly accessible, inexpensive apparatus for near-infrared (NIR) imaging of paintings: a long-pass filter with a 750 nm cut-on wavelength mounted on a Samsung HTC smartphone back-facing camera. This method proved effective in improving visibility of underdrawings, as well as in the detection of compositional changes by the artist, retouchings, and original-composition elements obscured by damage or aging. Egg-tempera test panels, historic oil paintings, and wall murals were all imaged with the NIR-smartphone apparatus. The research presented in this paper demonstrates the potential of adapted consumer technology for interdisciplinary scientific investigation in museums and at heritage sites, which has the potential to raise public understanding of heritage science. This simple and affordable approach is a promising tool for teaching the importance of and principles behind the scientific investigation of artworks.

AB  - Contemporary research into science education has generally been conducted from the perspective of "conceptual change" in learning. This study sought to extend previous work by recognizing that human rationality can be influenced by the emotions generated by the learning environment and specific actions related to learning. Methods used in educational psychology were adopted to investigate the emotional experience of science students as affected by gender, teaching methods, feedback, and learning tasks. A multidisciplinary research approach combining brain activation measurement with multivariate psychological data theory was employed in the development of a questionnaire intended to reveal the academic emotions of university students in three situations: attending science class, learning scientific subjects, and problem solving. The reliability and validity of the scale was evaluated using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Results revealed differences between the genders in positive-activating and positive-deactivating academic emotions in all three situations; however, these differences manifested primarily during preparation for Science tests. In addition, the emotions experienced by male students were more intense than those of female students. Finally, the negative-deactivating emotions associated with participation in Science tests were more intense than those experienced by simply studying science. This study provides a valuable tool with which to evaluate the emotional response of students to a range of educational situations.

AB  - The integration of music and science is embodied in the music of the spheres, the ancient concept that the universe is ordered in a manner consistent with principles of musical harmony. This idea boasts a long history, from the teachings of Pythagoras (ca. 600 BC) through Isaac Newton in the eighteenth century, and makes a fascinating interdisciplinary topic accessible to middle and high school students. Several music-science correlations are explored, including the mathematical commonalities between musical intervals and planetary orbits. The article includes teaching suggestions and student activities.

AB  - Health professionals and policymakers are asking educators to place more emphasis on food and nutrition education. Integrating these topics into science curricula using hand-on, food-based activities may strengthen students' understanding of science concepts. The Food, Math, and Science Teaching Enhancement Resource (FoodMASTER) Initiative is a compilation of programs aimed at using food as a tool to teach mathematics and science. Previous studies have shown that students experiencing the FoodMASTER curriculum were very excited about the activities, became increasingly interested in the subject matter of food, and were able to conduct scientific observations. The purpose of this study was to: (1) assess 4th graders food-related multidisciplinary science knowledge, and (2) compare gains in food-related science knowledge after implementation of an integrated, food-based curriculum. During the 2009-2010 school year, FoodMASTER researchers implemented a hands-on, food-based intermediate curriculum in eighteen 4th grade classrooms in Ohio ("n" = 9) and North Carolina ("n" = 9). Sixteen classrooms in Ohio ("n" = 8) and North Carolina ("n" = 8), following their standard science curricula, served as comparison classrooms. Students completed a researcher-developed science knowledge exam, consisting of 13 multiple-choice questions administered pre-and post-test. Only subjects with pre-and post-test scores were entered into the sample (Intervention n = 343; Control n = 237). No significant differences were observed between groups at pre-test. At post-test, the intervention group scored (9.95 ± 2.00) significantly higher (p = 0.000) than the control group (8.84 ± 2.37) on a 13-point scale. These findings suggest the FoodMASTER intermediate curriculum is more effective than a standard science curriculum in increasing students' multidisciplinary science knowledge related to food.

AB  - Evolution is a fundamental, organising concept in biology, yet there is widespread resistance to evolution among US students and there are rising creationist challenges in Europe. Resistance to evolution is linked to lack of understanding of the age of the Earth. An understanding of deep time is thus essential for effective biology education. Landmarks--well-known events of known absolute age--are important in developing a mental framework for deep time. "Collective landmarks" are important events of which a group of students has accurate and precise knowledge. The collective landmarks for time were determined in several semesters of an interdisciplinary undergraduate course at a US public research university. A written survey was employed that asked students to select the appropriate ten-fold time range for ten important cosmological, biological and historical events. The collective landmarks were very similar across classes, including the Big Bang and the Cold War, and there was progress developing additional landmarks. No statistically significant differences in accuracy of estimation were detected across science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and social sciences majors. The potential utility of collective landmarks within a single biology course, and across a university biology programme, is described.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research can be defined as the practice of discovering new objects of knowledge beyond disciplinary borders. It often operates through the cross-fertilization and hybridization of concepts, theoretical frameworks, and methodological tools to enable the description, analysis, and understanding of the complexity of objects of study that cannot be reduced to the strict limits imposed by any one discipline. The aim of this article is to take stock of the theoretical and methodological issues involved in the interdisciplinary research process from the perspective of serendipity, which is a creative process of considerable value to science. The intent is to show that the decompartmentalization of disciplines, the ability to decenter and open one's mind to the unexpected are intrinsic to the work of researchers who position themselves between and beyond disciplines. Our contention is that, as a process of discovering with a completely open mind ("sine anticipatio mentis") things that are not being searched for, serendipity is thus capable of playing a central role in interdisciplinarity, boosting the exchange of ideas and speeding up their circulation among researchers committed to exploiting the heuristic dimension of the unexpected.

AB  - Integrating content and language (ICL) has been a widely applied methodology of language learning and teaching in the last 20 years. However, ICL studies for first-year undergraduate students of science and engineering are scarce. This study examined perceptions of incoming students and professors who participated in ICL classes at a Korean science and engineering school. Most of the participants found the ICL classes helpful for students to develop a better understanding of content lectures and what to expect in regular content lectures. Also, many students found student-centered activities, consisting of group work, particularly motivating and effective. The study recommends a formula of ICL instruction for students entering a university with an EMI policy and concludes with suggestions for the successful implementation of ICL classes for content lectures in the areas of science and engineering.

AB  - This paper presents exemplification of the ways in which teachers can incorporate the ideology of maker education into STEAM club activities. The intention is to showcase how science teachers can infuse making into their pedagogy and inject more creativity into the learning process, yet still link it to existing science curricula, more specifically to the physical sciences. Butterflies are an excellent example of a theme that readily bridges the sciences with the arts. Such a theme for project-based learning, through being aligned to a current fashion trend that appeals to many girls, could perhaps counter criticism of the maker movement's lack of inclusivity and instead potentially help to address the STEM gender gap.

AB  - Social-affective neuroscience is revealing that human brain development is inherently social--our very nature is organized by nurture. To explore the implications for human development and education, we present a series of interdisciplinary studies documenting individual and cultural variability in the neurobiological correlates of emotional feelings. From these studies, we derive educational research hypotheses and a theoretical framework that facilitates integrating sociocultural and neurobiological levels of analysis. Our overarching aim is to begin to conceptualize a role for neurobiological evidence in educational studies of sociality, emotion, culture, and identity. Overcoming the historical distance between educational and neuroscientific research on social-affective development would enable a more complete science of human experience and enhance appreciation of cultural learning, benefiting both fields.

AB  - WIKIed Biology is a National Science Foundation Transforming Undergraduate Education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics interdisciplinary project in which the authors developed and implemented a model for student centered, inquiry-driven instruction using Web 2.0 technologies to increase inquiry and conceptual understanding in biology. Web 2.0 applications enhance collaboration among users to find, create, manipulate, and disseminate information and can form a relevant connection between real-world science and students' learning of content. Students use Web 2.0 technologies in their daily lives; however, there is little empirical research into its impact on student learning. This paper describes a course in which Web 2.0 tools (del.i.cious, CiteULike, and Google docs and sites) were used to support the teaching--learning process, including the use of tagging and social bookmarking, academic resource management, and website collaboration and design. Students reported gains in understanding of the relationship between the science process, Web 2.0 technologies, and scientific communication, as well as skill in evaluating validity of sources from the internet. Critical Thinking Assessment Tests supported these data.

AB  - This research addresses the problem of how to tackle STEM education and its transformation into STEAM education in an inclusive school. It highlights the need for communication competence in collaborative teaching supported by problem-based (PBL), project-based (PrBL) and game-based (GBL) learning. At the same time, it is necessary to highlight the importance of arts in all the listed innovative forms of learning and teaching, as teamwork and cooperation between the members of these teams are extremely important. The key competence of this participation in the mentioned forms of knowledge is communication competence, which is manifested in students' self-confidence/lack of self-confidence, in their level of well-being, collaboration, motivation, their active role and awareness. The empirical research was conducted on a sample of eleven classes from six Slovenian-inclusive schools, with at least one student with SEN in each class. The research focused on the differences between students with and without SEN regarding their perception of STEAM lessons supported by gamification elements. The results showed that using innovative teaching methods can connect and positively affect STEAM, which, with the help of technology, engineering and art, consequently, improves a deeper understanding of the field of Science and Mathematics (S-tea-M).

AB  - Purpose: Knowing the students' readiness for the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) is essential to producing competent, knowledgeable and skilled graduates who can contribute to the skilled workforce in the country. This will assist the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to ensure that their graduates own skill sets needed to work in the 4IR era. However, studies on students' readiness and preparedness for the 4IR in developing countries such as the Sultanate of Oman are still lacking. Therefore, this study investigates students' readiness level and preparedness for the 4IR. The findings of this study will benefit the HEIs policymakers, administration, faculties, departments, industries and society at large since they will be informed of the student's readiness and preparedness toward industry 4.0. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted the measures from the same context as previous studies in this study. The questionnaire was divided into three sections; the first part described the purpose and introduction of the search with the surety to keep the data confidential. The second part consisted of demographical information like gender, education. The last parts consisted of four subsections, question items in these parts are based on the related previous study. Characteristics consisted of 14 items, knowledge consisted of 18 items related to 4IR technologies, Organizational Dimension comprised of four items related to academic programs, curriculum and training. Preparedness contained two items. The participants have rated all the items in 5-Likert scale. Findings: Results from structural equation modeling showed that students' characteristics, knowledge of 4IR technologies and organizational dimensions significantly impact their preparedness for the 4IR. The study also found that organizational dimensions have the highest impact on students' preparedness. Furthermore, the organizational dimension significantly influences students' knowledge of 4IR technology. Moreover, students' characteristics related to 4IR are significantly affected by their knowledge of 4IR technology and organizational dimension. The findings suggest that HEIs are responsible for increasing the adoption of 4IR, and therefore organizational dimensions such as the academic programs, training, technological infrastructure and others are all critical for preparing students for a better future and should be given a priority. Research limitations/implications: This study has used academic programs and training to measure the organizational dimension. However, other important factors should be considered, such as technological infrastructure and leadership and governance of HEIs. Second, the current research depends on quantitative data, so future research should implement a mixed methodology (questionnaires, depth interviews, document analysis and focus group) to understand the factors affecting students' readiness for 4IR clearly. Finally, although the 4IR has numerous benefits, it also has challenges in its implementation, so future studies should focus on challenges encountered by different stakeholders in implementing 4IR-related technologies. Practical implications: The curriculum must include mandatory courses related to IT infrastructure design, user experience programming, electronic measurement and control principles, and programming for data science. HEIs should also foster interdisciplinary knowledge by integrating IT, Engineering, Business and Sciences. Furthermore, the HEIs should develop their infrastructure to have smart campuses, labs, classrooms and libraries to make HEIs a space where knowledge can be generated and innovative solutions can be proposed. This entails HEIs offering necessary hardware, software and technical support because if the HEIs improve their technological resources, students will be capable of using 4IR-related technologies effectively. Originality/value: The advancement of technology has resulted in the emergence of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, robotics, cloud computing, data science, virtual reality and 3D printing. It is essential to investigate students' readiness for 4IR. However, there is no study as per researchers' knowledge talked about students readiness in HEIs in the Arab world. This study could be a basis for more research on students' perception of the 4IR covering students from various backgrounds and levels.

AB  - The forces of globalization are magnifying the importance of interdisciplinary creative work. While the field of creativity studies always has been more open to interdisciplinary idea borrowing than many other fields, it can and should do more interdisciplinary synthesizing. This article begins with a discussion of the rationale for encouraging interdisciplinary work in the field and then explores several examples of constructs imported from various disciplines that can enrich theory and research in creativity studies. These constructs include market fundamentalism from economics, and networked science from various STEM fields. Some other candidates for importation also are discussed briefly.

AB  - Understanding student learning in health science professional programs is both timely and relevant and is the focus of this article. "The Table of Learning" by Lee Shulman (2002) provided a tool for an interdisciplinary reflection surrounding student learning in clinical laboratory science and occupational therapy. Utilizing the taxonomy pieces, we constructed a visual representation of how students learn in these two programs. Our work, utilizing "The Table of Learning," and subsequently the design of our model allowed us as educators from two separate programs to examine the learning process. Other health care programs may view this model as a template in their interdisciplinary Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) conversations.

AB  - Home economics operates in the academic, curriculum and social realms, as well as in everyday life. Due to its multidisciplinarity, it includes and interconnects the contents of different disciplines (e.g., healthy lifestyle, nutrition, dietetics, textiles, home, family, consumption, personal and family economics, design and technology), which are considered in terms of meeting the needs of the individual, family, and society. Home economics education and literacy play an important role in acquiring knowledge and skills that help raise the quality of life of the individual, family, and society. With the development of society, the needs of both the individual and the family are changing; therefore, changes are also needed in home economics education, which is reflected in the updating of the subject curricula. The goals and contents in the curriculum must reflect and meet the needs of the current society and take into account the cultural dependence and social determinism of the home economics field. To a certain extent, the current curriculum of the subject home economics in Slovene elementary schools already includes some content areas that have been recognised as important for meeting the needs of society. These relate to healthy lifestyle, nutrition, health, textiles, consumption, economics, family, environment and sustainable development. Given the perceived needs of society, the use of household appliances, home contents, and first aid should be additionally included in home economics education in Slovenia, and students should be encouraged to develop social and communication skills. It is also necessary to consider the appropriate placement of the subject in the curriculum, as it is necessary to implement home economics education in the entire elementary school education. Doing so will enable the acquisition of knowledge and skills needed in society and, therefore, the appropriate level of home economics literacy of the individual.

AB  - Background: There is now substantial evidence that language interventions delivered to small groups can be effective for improving language skills and hence strengthening the foundation for formal schooling. However, there are remaining challenges when delivering such interventions in naturalistic environments at scale. Method: We reflect on three randomised trials designed to evaluate the impact of an early years language programme, prior to the implementation of a large effectiveness trial, delivered in partnership with speech and language professionals. We consider findings within a framework from implementation science. Results: We found that, in contrast to policy-led interventions for reading and mathematics, language interventions are not prioritised in mainstream settings. Aside from this, other obstacles to delivery were the time taken to prepare and to timetable sessions, lack of communication about the requirements of delivery and the need for language screening. Crucial to success was the support from the class teacher of teaching assistants delivering the intervention. However, feedback was largely positive from most stakeholders, and the intervention was found to have a positive impact on children's language with preliminary evidence for effects on behaviour and on reading comprehension. Conclusions: While many educators recognise the importance of language for communication, the benefits of oral language interventions are only recently becoming prioritised by policy-makers. We propose that challenges to successful delivery and adoption of evidence-based language interventions in mainstream settings can be remedied through better communication with stakeholders and collaboration between researchers and professional colleagues including senior leaders, teachers, teaching assistants, speech and language therapists and psychologists. It is imperative to take account of issues of implementation when designing an intervention and to do this successfully is a multidisciplinary enterprise.

AB  - Linux Laptop Orchestra (L2Ork), founded in 2009 in the Virginia Tech Music Department's Digital and Interactive Sound & Intermedia Studio, "explores the power of gesture, communal interaction, and the multidimensionality of arts, as well as technology's potential to seamlessly integrate arts and sciences with particular focus on K-12 education" (Bukovic 2016). L2Ork has formed a unique partnership with Virginia Tech's Integrative STEM Education department to enable students to become proficient in multiple technological literacy standards while learning computer programming to design musical scores. Students then collaborate with these scores to create complex digital music systems--the laptop orchestra. This initiative was implemented at a middle school in southwest Virginia. Participants came from the subgroup of students who attend the school's Boys and Girls Club of America afterschool program. There were ten student participants (four males and six females), aged 11-13. Prior to the first L2Ork lesson, participants completed the 16-item VARK Questionnaire for Younger People. This instrument quantified learning preferences into: Visual, Aural, Read/Write, and Kinesthetic. Most student participants exhibited a multimodal learning preference, relying on different learning types in different situations. On average, students achieved an intermediate score on the performance tasks, showing noticeable improvements in programming knowledge and skills in a relatively short time. Throughout the process students were engaged in multiple "Standards for Technological Literacy" content standards, and the following benchmarks were observed: (1) The Nature of Technology; and (2) Core Concepts of Technology. The article shares lessons learned for successful transdisciplinary collaboration and how to use L2Ork in schools.

AB  - Data science is emerging as a field that is revolutionizing science and industries alike. Work across nearly all domains is becoming more data driven, affecting both the jobs that are available and the skills that are required. As more data and ways of analyzing them become available, more aspects of the economy, society, and daily life will become dependent on data. It is imperative that educators, administrators, and students begin today to consider how to best prepare for and keep pace with this data-driven era of tomorrow. Undergraduate teaching, in particular, offers a critical link in offering more data science exposure to students and expanding the supply of data science talent. "Data Science for Undergraduates: Opportunities and Options" offers a vision for the emerging discipline of data science at the undergraduate level. This report outlines some considerations and approaches for academic institutions and others in the broader data science communities to help guide the ongoing transformation of this field.

AB  - This research aimed to: a) synthesize the Science, Technology, and Society Phenomenon-based Learning Model (STS-PhBL) for teaching Geoharzard to students; and b) compare students' problem-solving skills prior to and after the STS-PhBL lessons on the Geoharzard topic. The sample consisted of 39 Grade 12 students enrolled in the first semester of the 2021 academic year at one secondary school in Surin Province, Thailand. The data collection methods included the panel of experts' evaluation of STS-PhBL lesson plans and the Problem-Solving Skills Test. The Index of Item-Objective-Congruence (IOC) of STS-PhBL lesson plans on Geoharzard was calculated. Also, the students' problem-solving skills prior to and after the STS-PhBL lessons in the Geoharzard topic were analyzed by using the paired-samples t-test. The researchers synthesized a new STS-PhBL model from the intensive literature review, consisting of seven teaching steps: a) stimulate the phenomenon; b) identify problems in the phenomenon; c) explore the answer to the targeted problem; d) construct new knowledge; e) reflect on learning; f) exchange and share learning; and g) apply knowledge. The STS-PhBL lesson plans on Geoharzard met the IOC requirements. After learning STS-PhBL lessons, the students significantly improved their problemsolving skills at the 0.05 statistically significant level.

AB  - Background and Context: The Domain-Specific Programming (DSP) platforms EarSketch and TunePad are being used widely in schools for coding novices. Existing studies on both platforms have mainly concentrated on attitudinal changes, leaving a gap in the literature. Objective: The purpose of this research was to advance our understanding of two contrasting DSP platform designs that aim to achieve the same Computational Thinking (CT) learning goals. Method: Two mixed-method case studies were conducted in an authentic school setting to evaluate the design and use of EarSketch and TunePad. Findings: The results suggest both platforms enabled CT that contributed to interdisciplinary learning outcomes, but educators and DSP platform designers should be mindful of their respective strengths, weaknesses, and limitations. Implications: Each platform may suit diverse educational goals, considering individual student backgrounds and interests. Additionally, when designing DSP platforms with interactive graphical features, trade-offs for enabling CT should be considered.

AB  - Some level of understanding of and about nanoscience and nanotechnology (NST) has been suggested as being relevant in up-to-date scientific literacy for all. Research scientists working in these fields are central in current efforts to inform and engage the public in NST. Earlier research has shown that scientists can contribute to authentic science learning, but communication always entails roles that affect the choice of content. This study investigated NST researchers' views on the nature of their research and their preferences in NST communication. Eight experienced professors working in various fields of NST were interviewed. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews focused on the scientists' views on (1) the nature of their research, and (2) aspects of NST that should be communicated to the public. Qualitative content analysis of the interviews revealed that the themes the interviewees highlighted when describing their research (interdisciplinarity, size scale, methods, objects, nature of NST in general) were somewhat different from the ones they considered as important for communication to the public (applications and products, risks and benefits, visualizations). The results problematize the simplistic notion that exposure to real scientists would unquestionably enhance the authenticity of science learning. This study gives insight for research and development of science communication, especially scientists' role and training in it.

AB  - Recent years have seen an explosion of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research leading to myriad practical applications. This backdrop serves as a powerful motivator for students. George Mason University hosts an annual Aspiring Students Summer Internship Program (ASSIP) for students to participate as interns in ongoing research with faculty across all STEM disciplines, ranging from purely experimental or dry-lab projects, to interdisciplinary work at their interface. Student interns in our particular laboratory are trained in computational mutagenesis of protein structures, cross-disciplinary work incorporating ideas from diverse STEM disciplines. The data generated are used for training machine learning models to predict the functional effects of protein mutations on stability, activity, drug resistance, or potential for human disease. All interns showcase and communicate their discoveries during a final poster symposium.

AB  - In this article, the argument is put forth that controversies about the scope and limits of science should be considered in Nature of Science (NOS) teaching. Reference disciplines for teaching NOS are disciplines, which reflect upon science, like philosophy of science, history of science, and sociology of science. The culture of these disciplines is characterized by controversy rather than unified textbook knowledge. There is common agreement among educators of the arts and humanities that controversies in the reference disciplines should be represented in education. To teach NOS means to adopt a reflexive perspective on science. Therefore, we suggest that controversies within and between the reference disciplines are relevant for NOS teaching and not only "the" NOS but "about" NOS should be taught, too. We address the objections that teaching about NOS is irrelevant for real life and too demanding for students. First, we argue that science-reflexive meta-discourses are relevant for students as future citizens because the discourses occur publicly in the context of sociopolitical disputes. Second, we argue that it is in fact necessary to reduce the complexity of the above-mentioned discourses and that this is indeed possible, as it has been done with other reflexive elements in science education. In analogy to the German construct "Bewertungskompetenz" (which means the competency to make informed ethical decisions in scientific contexts), we suggest "epistemic competency" as a goal for NOS teaching. In order to do so, science-reflexive controversies must be simplified and attitudes toward science must be considered. Discourse on the scientific status of potential pseudoscience may serve as an authentic and relevant context for teaching the controversial nature of reflexion on science.

AB  - This article utilizes speculative and visual storytelling alongside interdisciplinary research on artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic oppression to engage in a thought experiment on how literacy studies might refuse the oppressionist logics currently undermining the possibilities of AI in literacy education. As technological advancements in education will only continue to increase and as society is yet to ascertain the parameters of an ethical AI system, it is paramount to analyze the past and present and contemplate potential futures, especially those that do not result in violence against Black and Brown peoples. To engage in speculation, we employ Endarkened Storywork (Toliver, 2022) to present an empirically driven, futuristic, science fiction narrative from two perspectives: (1) a US, Black girl who is forced to participate in AI-structured secondary schooling and (2) a Black girl in Haiti who is forced to live in a country polluted by technological byproduct. This narrative, which is grounded in academic research and news editorials, is accompanied by comic art and followed by a companion analysis detailing the theoretical backdrop of the story. By utilizing multiple methods of scholarly distribution, we provide multiple entry points for readers to engage with this work. We offer a means for readers to see--via story, art, and scholarship--the potential impacts of AI on Black people globally. Additionally, by situating this article in the creative and scholarly realms, we strategically deconstruct traditional forms and methods of knowledge production that have constrained academic research and rendered invisible alternative forms of data representation.

AB  - Art and Technology is an interdisciplinary art program at AAU that involves knowledge and methods ranging from the humanities, to engineering sciences. Art and Technology is a hybrid program that combines science and technology with the artistic imagination, and thus combines both artistic and academic methodologies. The main question this paper addresses is: "What is a problem in art?" The paper discusses what defines a problem as in the PBL Aalborg Model, in the field of Art and Technology, by analysing the problem formulations of the 2017 BA projects through Mogens Pahuus three types of problem orientation. The paper discusses the potentials and pitfalls of PBL in art and technology education.

AB  - The presence of social robots in children's daily environments has steadily increased. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), social robots have influenced children's learning and development. This study innovatively utilized the Web of Science database and conducted a bibliometric analysis of 517 publications on social robots supporting children's learning and development before September 2022. Unlike most existing reviews, this study employed a synergistic combination of two complementary visualization tools, VOSviewer and CiteSpace, to map the intellectual structure and analyze the knowledge evolution path in this emerging interdisciplinary field. Specifically, VOSviewer generated visualizations depicting collaboration networks, research hotspots, and trends based on co-occurrences. CiteSpace enabled quantitative measurements of node centrality and burstness to reveal pivotal entities and emerging topics. Combining visual mapping and quantitative analysis by VOSviewer and CiteSpace allowed comprehensive landscape mapping for an in-depth investigation into the development of this field. This study proposes future research directions, including children's perceptions of social robots, social robots enhancing children's learning, social robots supporting children's social and emotional development, and social robots for children with special needs. The findings also inform the design and application of child-friendly social robots equipped with generative AI techniques.

AB  - This research is based on a multi-disciplinary and multi-levelled analysis of evidence to present the case that education reform needs to be contextualised far more widely than is currently practised. It focuses on the voices of Cambodian local teacher trainers through interviews over a five-year period. Interview data is triangulated against academic sources, national policy documents and classroom observations. The research reveals how notions of globalisation and knowledge economy have led to education being driven by measurable outcomes resulting in simplified educational policies that have a negative impact on teacher development. By allowing the Khmer teacher trainers to articulate their opinions on a wide range of themes, the interviews provide evidence to support historical and cultural theories proposed by academics working in the social sciences in Cambodia. This approach identifies that a deeper contextual analysis should enable teacher development programmes to be more closely aligned to national contexts.

AB  - A qualitative case study was conducted at six purposively sampled universities; out of a population of approximately 23 universities. This sampling strategy was based on selecting some universities that became Universities of Technology during the process of merging Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) while other universities kept their identity; currently being referred to as Traditional Universities. In-depth interviews and analysis of curriculum documents were used as sources of data acquisition to address the aim and questions explored by this study explored; necessitated by the need to implement Minimum Requirements for Teaching Education Qualification (MRTEQ) policy guidelines. The sampled universities' identities were concealed and pseudonyms were assigned to participants for ethical reasons. Qualitative methods were applied for data analysis. Findings revealed that for some institutions' integration of sub-disciples of science curriculum led to contestations and debates resulting from different philosophical perceptions held by subject specialists in the curriculum design process. Knowledge integration continues to be a contested field in universities that typifies resistance to change. Some participants demonstrated a positive disposition towards knowledge integration models which they used in curriculum development. This study concludes that a collaborative and collegial deliberation among science education lecturers and experts in various knowledge domains could be a way to find common ground on issues highlighted in this study. Re-thinking and re-conceptualising knowledge organisation for science academic knowledge are appropriate to the needs of school curriculum and benefit science teachers with knowledge and competences for knowledge impartation, skills and values in the subject.

AB  - In today's information age, developing data science competencies has become vital to fostering responsible citizenry. However, the actual techniques learners need to become proficient in are still somewhat "in-construction", as the relatively new field of data science is constantly expanding to meet new data-related demands. Data science education needs to develop innovative means to keep up with this expansion that focus less on proficiency in specific techniques, but rather introduce novices to authentic data practices, and the authentic purposes directing the authentic practices. This paper focuses on a specific practice, the use of simulations to generate and examine data, in the context of authentic scientific Citizen Science research. We provide a case study of one pair of middle school students' engagement in an extended learning sequence including simulation activities inspired by authentic data practices, adapted to also be authentic for young students. While the simulation activity was inspired by the scientists' purposes, our findings illustrate four different actual purposes the students attributed to it. We also show that as the students deepened their engagement with the simulation, they gradually appropriated its intended purpose, alongside articulating more mature views of data-related concepts. The conclusions summarize the four different purposes the students expressed and identify aspects of design that contributed to the gradual re-shaping process of their actual purposes.

AB  - How can history museums incorporate Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) activities while preserving their missions and identities? How do interdisciplinary experiences lead to learning? A cross-institutional exhibit development and evaluation team wrestled with these ideas as they developed "Create.Connect," an National Science Foundation-funded exhibition at Conner Prairie designed to weave together historical narrative and STEM activity. The goal was to create a truly interdisciplinary experience, where history and STEM learning would not just exist side-by-side, but interact in ways that might spark new interest or deeper learning. While visitors to Conner Prairie accepted, enjoyed and valued the "Create.Connect" experience, and families explored both history and STEM during their visit, conceptualizing and defining "integrated" history and STEM learning proved challenging for both exhibit developers and evaluators. What emerged were several definitions and levels of integration and a nascent understanding of the complexity of learning in interdisciplinary exhibitions.

AB  - Virtual mobility experiences provide a valuable option to enrich student learning and development from home. However, there is a lack of evidence of how these online experiences are leveraged in STEM and their potential positive effect on students' critical thinking capabilities. This study explores and details the design of a short-term virtual program and its influence on science students' critical thinking. The program focused broadly on agriculture through the lens of sustainability and the SDGs whereby students engaged in collaborative research, reflection and intercultural interaction and dialogue. Analysis of students' learning journals and focus group responses suggest that students achieved the learning outcomes of the program related to critical thinking, nurturing students to think and potentially act differently while broadening students' personal understanding, connection, and confidence in relation to science. This paper discusses the experience from the perspective of the Australian undergraduate students.

AB  - In this response article, we explain why sustainability issues are often interpreted as 'wicked' or unstructured problems and focus on the consequences for education and societal transformation in view of sustainable development. Drawing on Funtowicz and Ravetz' (1993) fourfold 'facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent' we analyse how the different articles of this special issue tackle the 'post-normal' characteristics of sustainability issues. To stimulate the interdisciplinary dialogue and put forward an open concept that can serve as a helpful framework for research collaborations and/on educational practices, we put forward three maxims of 'post-normal education' (PNE). Like Funtowicz and Ravetz, who highlighted the specificity of post-normal science, we put the specificity of PNE on the agenda, and more in particular, we stress the need to balance the urgency and the wickedness of sustainability issues.

AB  - To what extent, and why, do social science undergraduates experience anxiety about taking statistics courses? Despite holding assumptions of rampant statistics anxiety among students, sociologists have conducted few empirical studies of this issue. We extend the literature by analyzing data from a survey of sociology, social work, and criminal justice students enrolled in seven sections of our department's Social Statistics with Computer Applications course in the winter 2018 semester. Two thirds of respondents are anxious or very anxious about taking the course. They experience statistics anxiety primarily due to their lack of confidence in their ability to succeed in the course and their more general test-taking anxiety. This article offers a framework for instructors of social statistics courses to measure student anxiety and to address it in class in a way that aims to alleviate anxiety among the anxious while not alienating those who are comfortable in the course.

AB  - New science facilities have become a reality on many college campuses in the last few decades. Large time investments in creating shared programmatic vision and designing flexible spaces, partnered with large fiscal investments, have created a new generation of science building. Unfortunately, few studies provide evidence about whether the articulated goals were achieved. In this study, we revisit assessment of our science facilities after 5 years of occupancy, looking specifically for sustained gains in (a) student perceptions of interdisciplinarity, (b) the ability to stay focused despite high levels of visual connectedness, and (c) overall appreciation for the learning environment.

AB  - Curriculum initiatives that provide the societal context of engineering practice can contribute to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI) within the profession, as well as within the communities served by engineers. JEDI curriculum can foster diversity and inclusion by acknowledging and addressing social justice issues, providing a safe and inclusive space for students' voices to be heard, and advancing a productive dialogue within their institution of higher learning. Furthermore, such curriculum initiatives can empower students with the theoretical frameworks, analytical tools, and knowledge base to recognize and address ethical challenges and opportunities related to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion in their field. This Teaching Tips paper offers a description of a pilot program to incorporate JEDI material within a core bioengineering course modeled on evidence-based curriculum programs to embed ethics within technical courses. The author and collaborators sought to achieve two aims with the JEDI-focused material: (1) for students to learn how justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion intersect with bioengineering practice through an interdisciplinary lens of history, philosophy, sociology and anthropology which provide strong scholarly frameworks and theoretical foundations and (2) for students to participate in and foster an inclusive environment within their own educational institution through effectively communicating about these topics with each other. At the conclusion of the semester, a student survey indicated an overwhelmingly positive reception of the material. This paper will discuss the interdisciplinary curriculum development initiative, how the learning objectives were addressed by the specific lesson plans, and challenges to be addressed to create a sustainable educational model for the program.

AB  - This paper describes the development of different lesson plans dealing with authentic and controversial socio-scientific issues in the framework of climate change. These lesson plans orient themselves along the socio-critical, problem-oriented approach to science teaching. They deal with the use of bioethanol as an alternative fuel and with the phenomenon of climate change itself. The development of these lesson plans for chemistry classes using Participatory Action Research will also be discussed. Parallel approaches to Physics, Biology and Politics education taken in the project "Climate Change Before the Court" will also be outlined briefly. Experiences from applying these lesson plans in German chemistry teaching are also discussed. (Contains 6 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - The paper describes an analysis of the questions posed by high school students regarding relationships between science and religion in a series of debates with scientists in public high schools of the northern part of Portugal. The exploratory interpretation of 171 collected anonymous written questions allowed for the detection of fragilities in the students' ideas about the nature of science and the nature of religion, connected with a trend to reject religion using scientism arguments. The findings reinforce a need of revising the fragmented teaching of nature of science and its connections with religion towards a more contextualized approach of diversified episodes of these social endeavours, anchored in life's 'big questions' that allow students to make cross-disciplinary connections. Our analysis also supports the need for more research on students' questions rather than on students' "answers" in more common research methodologies conducted to inform the development of a more meaningful curriculum.

AB  - Interdisciplinary project teams are increasingly vital in organizations that are focused on providing successful technical solutions that include a positive user experience. In response to the need for experience in this area, some higher education institutions have created interdisciplinary project-based experiential learning opportunities. In this research, we examine an interdisciplinary computing capstone course and present results from a qualitative study of student participants. We investigate how teams in an interdisciplinary capstone course self-organize, what convictions drive these decisions, and how they assess and value the expected contributions from disciplines other than their own. We analyze students' attitudes, beliefs, and motivations as gleaned from interviews and offer suggested improvement strategies for future interdisciplinary capstone courses.

AB  - Nanotoxicity is an area of intense research, stimulated by increased use of nanoparticles in commercially available products. Herein, using nanotoxicity as a platform, we describe an experiment that emphasizes interdisciplinary science in a collaborative work setting while expanding the traditional realm of chemistry and chemistry research. Students synthesize two noble metal nanoparticle suspensions (Au and Ag) and expose brine shrimp to these nanoparticles, assessing the brine shrimp viability after 24 h exposure. By examining two different nanoparticles at several concentrations, with appropriate control conditions, students can work together to collect and analyze all the toxicity results necessary to draw conclusions about the toxicity of Au and Ag nanoparticles. This experiment provides introductory chemistry students hands-on experience with a cutting-edge area of science while showcasing the real-world application of chemistry to an important modern scientific problem, nanoparticle toxicity.

AB  - Scientific reasoning and aesthetics are not mutually exclusive disciplines, as scientists' achievements are based not only on cognitive ability, but also on creativity, imagination, and embodied thought through various experiences. With the aim of investigating the role of aesthetic experience in the learning processes involved in the integration of art, science, and technology, this study explored students' experience of creating interactive art, which is the combination of art, science, and technology, within the context of Korean STEAM education. The participants were 19 high school students majoring in art. Each student envisioned their own artwork and constantly held individual consultations on their ideas with technical, artistic, and science education experts. I visited and observed this project for nine months and collected various types of qualitative data, such as conversations between students and technical experts, individual interviews with students, interview with a teacher, and students' artefacts. These data are used to construct a case study to interpret the meaning of art high school students' experiences of interactive art creation from the perspective of aesthetics. Through this learning experience, students were able to recognise the limitations of their thoughts and transform their ideas through the application of new scientific knowledge and skills.

AB  - Schools are increasingly integrating multidisciplinary education into their programmes. The Minister of Education, Culture and Science has introduced a new, integrated science subject in secondary education in the Netherlands, called Nature, Life and Technology (NLT). This research note describes the design of a generic model for a professional development programme to prepare teachers with and assist them during the implementation of a multidisciplinary science module. Three sources were used for this design: subject features including school practices, the curriculum design phases, and professional development characteristics, in combination with three factors influencing the quality of the professional development: context, process and content. These sources and factors have been translated into a generic model. Three experts evaluated this generic model: a teacher trainer who was also involved in the development of NLT modules; a biology and NLT teacher who was also involved in a regional NLT information centre; and a chemistry and NLT teacher. Overall, the experts were positive. They judged 12 out of 13 aspects of the model as sufficient or better. They were, however, critical about the issue of whether the model offers sufficient possibilities for participants to familiarise themselves with new subject content knowledge.

AB  - STEM education is gaining increasing attention globally to fulfill the acute shortage of STEM workforce. Executing STEM education is frequently viewed as a complex and challenging agenda. The current study proposes Integrated STEM-lab activities in the teaching and learning of electrolysis. The activities use real-world contexts as a platform to exhibit the transdisciplinary nature of integration of the four STEM disciplines. Embedded mixed methods research used quantitative one group pre-test--post-test design, and qualitative interviews were employed to measure the effectiveness of the Integrated STEM-lab activities in improving 50 secondary school students' (Form Four equivalent to Grade 9) understanding of electrolysis. The Electrolysis Diagnostics Instrument was administered for pre- and post-tests. One-way Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) revealed that the Integrated STEM-lab activities effectively improved the students' understanding of electrolysis measured in three subscales (Wilks' lambda = 0.664;F(3,96) = 16.164; p o 0.05; Z = 0.336) with 33.6% of the variances in the pre- and post-tests explained by the treatment. The qualitative interview data supported and provided insight into understanding the quantitative findings. In the interviews, the students elaborated their understanding of electrolysis with details, and consistently the activities were referred to in their responses. The findings of this study suggest that Integrated-STEM lab activities are suitable to address the limitation of the existing laboratory activities for knowledge construction. The activities are exemplary for integrating the four STEM disciplines into the standard science curriculum.

AB  - This study explores the perceptions of five in-service chemistry and mathematics teachers in using productive lesson study as a framework for teaching and learning. Introductory professional development workshops on horizontal articulation, productive pedagogy and lesson study were given to teachers at the onset of the project. Teachers were then tasked to produce two research lessons for grade 10 chemistry using the productive lesson study framework. We utilised inductive thematic analysis to identify the themes underpinning the perceptions of the teachers. Findings show that the teachers improved and deepened their knowledge by learning from each other's perspectives. They had also adopted effective strategies for teaching by reflecting on their students' learning, which helped them address the challenges of integrating and relating different topics into one. Furthermore, they became more aware of their students' prior knowledge which enabled them to address misconceptions. Thus, learning was reinforced, broadened and extended. Participating in the study made a transformative intervention in the teachers as they became more focused on the enhancement of their professional practice as teachers.

AB  - This study was conducted to determine if embedding effective study strategies in a course would result in an increased use of these strategies and, therefore, increase success and retention in introductory-level science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) courses. An interdisciplinary team of STEM faculty members created study strategies video modules that were embedded in their courses. A concurrent course in the same subject was taught without the modules, with this course serving as a control. Data were collected regarding course content knowledge, study strategies awareness, study strategies use, student confidence, course completion, course success, and course retention. Over the course of 3 semesters, faculty team members collected data via pre- and posttests and surveys. Completion, success, and retention data were obtained from college records. A significant change (p < 0.0001) in the use of flashcards, interleaving, spaced practice, and the Pomodoro Technique was seen in students exposed to the study strategies modules. A significant change (p < 0.01) was also seen in time management in the experimental group. Although results indicate that exposure to study strategies makes students aware of their skill deficits, efficacy data indicate that other factors keep them from fully adopting new study techniques.

This pilot study presents the BacToMars videogame and accompanying curricular intervention, designed to introduce children (aged 7-11) to foundational concepts of bioengineering and to the interdisciplinary nature of scientific endeavors. Background: This pilot study explores the bioengineering-related learning outcomes and attitudes of children after engaging with the BacToMars game and curriculum intervention. Methodology: This study drew on prior findings in game-based learning and applied them to a videogame designed to connect microbiology with Constructionist microworlds. An experimental comparison showed the learning and engagement affordances of integrating this videogame into a mixed-media bioengineering curriculum. Elementary-aged children (N = 17) participated in a 9-hour learning intervention, with one group of n = 8 children receiving the BacToMars videogame and the other group (n = 9) receiving traditional learning activities on the same content. Pre- and post-surveys and interview data were collected from both groups. Contribution: This paper contributes to education research on children's ability to meaningfully engage with abstract concepts at the intersection of science and engineering through bioengineering education, and to design research on developing educational technology for introducing bioengineering content to elementary school children. Findings: Children in both groups showed improved knowledge and attitudes related to bioengineering. Children who used BacToMars showed slightly stronger performance on game-specific concepts, while children in the control condition showed slightly higher generalized knowledge of bioengineering concepts. Recommendations for Practitioners: Practitioners should consider bioengineering as a domain for meaningful, interdisciplinary learning in elementary education. Recommendation for Researchers: Design researchers should develop playful ways to introduce bioengineering concepts accurately and to engage children's imaginations and problem-solving skills. Education researchers should further investigate developmentally appropriate ways to introduce bioengineering in elementary education. Impact on Society: BacToMars introduces a meaningful scenario to contextualize complex concepts at the intersection of science and engineering, and to engage children in real-world, interdisciplinary problem solving. Future Research: Future research should explore BacToMars and bioengineering curricula for elementary-aged children in larger samples, with longer intervention times.

AB  - This research aims to examine the effect of integrating arts in a laboratory practice, concerning basic artistic stage, chemistry and art, dermocosmetics, and laboratory practice level dermocosmetics production, on the learning performance of students. The application process consisted of two stages, namely an experimental stage and an artistic stage. In the experimental stage, the students basically produced soap, shampoo, body fragrance, tonic, lotion, cream, disinfectant and cologne in collaboration. Within the scope of the artistic stage, the students decorated the products they produced in the experimental stage using visual art and handcrafting techniques in an environment where they listened to classical music. They then created their own scenarios and recorded a short commercial to promote their products. The learning performances of the students were measured through a pre-/post-test of course content. At the end of the application process, it was concluded that the learning performance of the students improved, and the students provided positive feedback expressing that the application was instructive, reinforcing and entertaining and gave them the opportunity to develop a perspective toward art.

AB  - In recent years considerable advances in both theoretical formulation and in methodologies have appeared in the Educational effectiveness research field. Yet there is a significant lack of studies that are focused on the effectiveness of learning tasks. Structured content analysis of learning tasks can provide information about learning opportunities and therefore, it has the potential to refine this field. The goal of this study was to describe and demonstrate a methodological framework for evaluating the quality of learning tasks based on innovative developments in the field of education. The methodological framework includes three dimensions: educational principles and practices, high-order thinking skills, and psychological approaches to learning. The methodology was tested in four learning contexts: inter-disciplinary inquiry lessons; mathematics; sciences; and extensive narrative subject lessons. Pedagogical differences were characterised. The tool makes several theoretical and practical contributions: It can serve researchers in pedagogical characterisation processes; it can advance teachers' professional development with a focus on the development of the 'new teacher' as a designer of effective learning environments; and it can be used to mediate between theory and practice.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this paper is to provide a historical overview of studies on generalisation in mathematics education for future research. Because, generalisation is one of the most important mathematical thinking processes and the essence of mathematics. Thus, there are many studies related with generalisation. Method: This study is survey article. Our hypothetical theoretical framework is "whose generalisation becomes the object of each study" and "where is the position of the researcher and his/her object(s) of analysis (that is, someone who is generalising)". Findings: Considering this framework, we propose the following four periods: "human generalisation in mathematics," "human generalisation in mathematics education," "students' generalisation in mathematics education," and "learners' generalisation in education and/or interdisciplinarity." Significance: There are various studies that is related with generalisation in discipline of mathematics education. To regard with its long history and tradition, sometimes it makes our perplexity when we want to investigate students' generalisation; because, their methodology, background theory, focus and so on are very different from each other.

AB  - This case addresses the critical topic in education of developing students' skills and capabilities associated with enterprise-level business intelligence systems and associated internal control concerns. The experiences of using a business intelligence,task-based activity in an interdisciplinary curriculum model are presented and discussed. Pedagogically, the task-based activity enhances perceived learning for both accounting and IS disciplines indomain (internal controls and IS development), communication (comprehension and creation), and critical thinking skills. Additionally, students appreciate the realism and active learning associated with the task-based activity delivered in an interdisciplinary curriculum model. The design of the task-based activity as a teaching resource allows other instructors, based on their requirements, to develop a lesson plan around using the activity as written, or focusing on the any of the many aspects of controls or technology presented.

AB  - Challenges to the Arctic region abound and intersect. Warming, ice and permafrost melting, and pollution jeopardize health and food security of Indigenous and other Northern communities. Problems related to natural resource extraction and shipping are developing. Because these issues cross sovereign boundaries, they must be addressed multilaterally. The Arctic Council is the principal forum in which Arctic states and Indigenous groups address shared concerns in the region. We co-administered a five-day program on science and diplomacy in the Arctic at Dartmouth College in June 2017 to educate postsecondary students on Arctic challenges and governance, foster skills and confidence related to leadership and diplomacy, and inspire civic action in Arctic and international affairs. The program consisted of lectures, discussions, a teamwork and collaboration exercise, a negotiation workshop, and a Model Arctic Council (MAC)--a simulation of delegates' work in the Arctic Council. We found that students had strongly positive perceptions of the curriculum and felt that they accrued Arctic-related awareness and skills, while developing enthusiasm for engaging in civic affairs. Students attributed the program's value to the use of multiple pedagogies, especially simulation, an interdisciplinary environment, and mentorship from and engagement with Arctic Council and other practitioners.

AB  - A collaborative of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and education faculty developed a STEM certificate aimed at elementary education majors. A four-phase process model was used to create and evaluate courses. The certificate is comprised of three interdisciplinary, team-taught, lab-based courses: Environmental Biology, Chemistry of Life, and Engineering in Your World. The biology and chemistry courses are inquiry based, whereas the engineering course is project based. Each of the courses is cotaught by a faculty member in STEM and a faculty member in education. The goal of the certificate is to improve elementary education majors' STEM competence and confidence. Initial assessment results showed significant gains in confidence and competence on the basis of knowledge test items. Curriculum continues to be refined on the basis of assessments and changing state and national education standards. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to introduce a case-based module teaching sustainable engineering, linking the Envision rating system with behavioral decision science. Three complete modules are publicly available in a repository for any instructor to adapt, use and review. Design/methodology/approach: A case study was written about the Tucannon River Wind Farm, a project-certified Gold by the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure's Envision™ rating system. The case was used as the basis for an in-class PowerPoint module to achieve student learning outcomes related to sustainability. Findings: Before and after surveys showed significant (p < 0.05) learning increases. Word clouds show changes in student perceptions of sustainable design. Rubric scoring of writing assignments and concept maps yielded valuable insights and improvements and demonstrated the overall validity of the module approach. Research limitations/implications: Modules lasting only one or two class days must be well-integrated into courses and curricula to promote greater learning value. Concept mapping may be a useful addition but involves a learning curve for both instructors and students. Practical implications: By offering instructors access to a set of case-based modules, it becomes more practical for them to teach about sustainable infrastructure and decision-making. Social implications: The module exemplifies a project owner and an engineering firm strongly committed to social and environmental sustainability. Envision's Quality of Life and Leadership categories emphasize community well-being, involvement and collaboration. Originality/value: This module offers a unique transdisciplinary focus meeting several needs in engineering education on sustainability, complex problems and decision-making.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate students' understandings of ocean sustainability and the pedagogical influence of higher education on those conceptions. Design/methodology/approach: The conceptions of ocean sustainability of 54 university students of various academic disciplines enrolled in the 2014/2015 semester course "Sustainable Oceans" were assessed through use of auto-photography. Data were collected at the beginning and end of the course. Inter-rater reliability was measured by percentage of identical coding outcomes by two coders. Findings: Auto-photography is effective in assessing notions of sustainability. Social and economic dimensions were captured less frequently than environmental aspects in the students' photographs. Overall, students demonstrated vague perceptual awareness about who should take responsibility concerning lifeworld-related issues. Also, their perceptions were affected by their choice of academic discipline. Engaging students in inter-/transdisciplinary learning, integrating the arts, science and community, helped develop a more balanced, action-motivated conception of sustainability. Post-test patterns of change in students' vision and action were observed. Practical implications: Implementing sustainability education in a university's coordinating bodies is effective in constructing a campus-based learning network, and participation in local community empowerment promotes a substantial and multidimensional concept of sustainability, and teaching material that includes content from the fine arts, literature or music stimulates students' awareness of, and sensitivity to, lifeworld issues. Originality/value: This paper provides an innovative, auto-photography-based methodology, including an operational procedure, coding book and method of analysis, for assessing students' conceptions of sustainability. It also develops an interdisciplinary course that serves a "threshold" intervention role in ocean sustainability education.

AB  - This work focuses on a possible teaching approach to promote chemistry learning for students during the first two years of technical high school in Italy (age 14-15). Critical thinking skills can be developed by integrating two different curriculum designs, converging in a novel didactic approach, a modified version of the Systemic Approach to Teaching and Learning (SATL). Interdisciplinary topics help to promote students' interest and motivation because of their applications in real situations, concerning in particular ethics and environmental issues. This method gives the right importance to a stimulating educational context where critical thinking skills are highly encouraged.

AB  - This article begins with clarification of any confusion one might have as to what is meant by Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education. The author writes that the acronym STEM was originally used in a political context to call attention to the demands of the future workforce in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics-related professions. At that time STEM meant a set of independent disciplines, each of which was abbreviated by one character. Later, educators saw this as a challenge to seek ways of developing integrated STEM Education, in which elements from the four individual disciplines could be used in combination. Currently, the acronym iSTEM (integrated STEM) is often used to distinguish from the previous meaning of STEM. The article goes on to explore the ambivalence of STEM education in the the Netherlands, which is one of the countries in which Technology Education struggles. Technology Education was introduced there as a separate subject in lower secondary education in 1993. Since 2004, schools there have had the freedom either to keep Technology Education as a separate subject or to integrate it with Science Education. The merger of Science and Technology, which can be seen as a movement towards integrated STEM Education in some schools, particularly those in which there was a strong Technology Education program, produced an unexpected positive effect. Suddenly, Technology Education was in the same realm as the important subject, Science, rather than in the realm of making crafts. Altogether, the case of the Netherlands offers experiences on the international stage which show the ambivalence of iSTEM for the position of Technology Education in the curriculum. There are examples in which iSTEM almost leads to the death of Technology Education and, at the same time, there are other examples that are very promising because they give prominent attention to Design and Technology in integrated projects. A determining factor is the type of teachers involved (a combination of Science and Technology teachers in the successful cases and mono-disciplinary teaching in the failed cases). The author concludes by advancing the idea that the experiences in the Netherlands show that it is possible to realise integrated STEM education, but only when this is done in cooperation between science, technology, and math teachers.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of instructional methods based on a one-day informal science field experience comparing a teacher-centered methodology versus a student-centered (inquiry-based) methodology. The 5E learning cycle was selected as the framework for implementing the inquiry-based learning for the treatment groups as it provides the structure of the constructivist learning cycle (Duran & Duran, 2004). The research design followed a quasi-experimental design with a total of three control and three treatment groups representing two individual schools. Each school included at least one treatment and one control group. The study included 117 third grade students. Both groups were given a pre and post assessment measuring the impact of the instructional method of inquiry presented in the 5E format. An independent-measures t-test was used to analyze the results of the means for the post-test assessments (treatment and control) and the means of the retention assessments. Pre-tests indicated variations of prior knowledge between the control and treatment groups. Post-tests indicated similar results of knowledge gains. However, the retention tests for the treatment groups revealed students increased their knowledge from the time of their post-test. The control groups' retention results were similar to their post-test results indicating knowledge was maintained.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining importance in education owing to its rapid development. This study addresses the importance of interdisciplinary education between technology and the humanities. The use of films as a teaching resource is suitable for interdisciplinary education because films represent creative forecasts and predictions on future human society, helping the public realize what could occur in the future. By utilizing films in instruction, students can be trained to understand the three key functions of IoT and acquire the ability to develop creative applications of IoT. An IoT teaching model using the films "Minority Report" (2002), "Big Hero 6" (2014), "Iron Man 3" (2013), "Her" (2013), and "Transcendence" (2014), all of which depict various applications of IoT that could be helpful in the teaching of the functions and concepts of IoT, is suggested; an interdisciplinary class is carried out for 15 weeks following the model. The effectiveness of the class is measured using quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis, and reflection journals. The findings show that students developed interdisciplinary capacity through education using films.

AB  - The article analyzes methodological approaches to constructing a didactic model of specialist courses in Ukraine and France. It is found that the main elements of higher education are knowledge, modes of activity (abilities, skills), creative search activities and emotional education. It is specified that knowledge is a system of determined acquired concepts, patterns of phenomena and objects of the objective world. It is clarified that the system of knowledge gained from specialist courses contains the following types of knowledge: scientific (scientific data on which a particular course is based); scientific and historical (the evolution of concepts, ideas and ways of their discovery); methodological (a set of knowledge about science methodology); philosophical, logical and interdisciplinary (the reflection of scientific connections in educational information); evaluative (the description of the individual's relation to the world and his/her system of values). It is stated that the modes of activity are viewed as general scientific, professional and specialist abilities and skills and in terms of psychology -- sensory, motor, sensory and motor, intellectual ones. Intellectual skills and abilities include note taking, working with reference literature, writing abstracts and reviews, preparing simple projects (maps, diagrams). It is noted that creative search activities imply a readiness to find solutions to new problems. They also involve applying knowledge and skills in non-standard conditions, considering a new problem under normal conditions, combining well-known modes of activity independently and applying a fundamentally new way of solving the problem. It is highlighted that emotional education is characterized by evaluative knowledge and norms of relation to the world. It is proved that the difference between academic courses and science lies in the fact that it includes only the main principles of one or another field of knowledge within a particular science available for students to acquire.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to provide other developing countries in the region a reference on the successful design education reformation in Taiwan. The study first reviews Taiwan's economic and design development to show their interconnection with local culture and the global market. Next, the study explores Taiwan's design education development which transforms from adopting STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) to STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, mathematics) in secondary school, and understands how it overcomes challenges by the help of both public and private sectors. Last, a conceptual framework is proposed to present and study Taiwan's design education development. The result from case studies validates that STEAM can reach SAD (science, arts, and design) in higher education and CHEER (collaboration, humanity, empathy, ecology, and renaissance) in design practice. Therefore, the result and implications provided by this study can serve as a reference for other countries in the region who share similar cultural and socioeconomic development and future goals as Taiwan.

AB  - The Deaf have often been overlooked when designing informal STEM education and public outreach activities. Astronomers at UC Riverside and teachers at the California School for the Deaf, Riverside (CSDR), have designed an astronomy workshop aimed specifically for the Deaf using the school's on-site sound lab. We have used astronomy for this workshop because the field has a significant edge over other sciences to act as portal for K-12 engagement in science given the imagery it presents, the answers it offers to grand questions, and its interdisciplinary nature. The workshop is an unconventional activity that excites the students and provides a positive experience in astronomy, based on knowledge that they already acquired beforehand in the classroom. Our workshop uses electromagnetic emissions, enhanced sounds and sonification processes of cosmic phenomena that have low frequencies and sufficiently distinguishable patterns which are delivered to students through a specialized designed sound lab for the Deaf. Storytelling paired with videos and images are used to give understandable meaning to the sounds of the Universe. Positive feedback was collected from over 80 students who participated in our workshop. Our activity can be reproduced elsewhere to further engage the Deaf community in science.

AB  - Experiential education is a highly prized and effective interdisciplinary methodology to supplement classroom instruction and to improve student learning. Experiential theories have a wide reach, traceable to Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates. John Dewey's pivotal work "Experience and Education," first published in 1938, is canonical in academic scholarship and has been expanded on throughout the 20th century, most notably by Kolb's scholarship spanning the 1980s to present day (Dewey, 1938). David Kolb's four-stage learning cycle is still used across disciplines in scholar's conversations on useful methods for helping students grasp complex academic content and experience transformative learning opportunities (Kolb, 2015). Four senior-level projects carried out in a special topics course in Family and Consumer Sciences at Southeastern Louisiana University provided students with an opportunity to rehearse the research skills they will need after graduation. These experiential learning projects focused on the obesity epidemic in the United States; they had a significant impact on student learning, not only for professional preparation, but also for emphasizing a topic of social significance.

AB  - Purpose: Approaches to learning have the ability to influence knowledge acquisition, comprehension, retention and even motivation to learn. Previous work indicates that despite age, experience, or prior knowledge, students have a tendency to approach learning differently as a function of the presented content. The purpose of this study is to explore how context influences student approaches to learning science. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopt a question-asking methodology to evaluate if approaches to learning the same science content vary when presented within the context of Pure Science or the History of Science. Findings: Results indicate that contextualizing the presentation of science content, shifts the approaches students take in attempting to learn science content as evidenced by the questions they ask to deepen their understanding. Additional variables of prior experience with each scientific concept, task persistence at a distractor task and later recall of the presented concepts were related to different inquiry strategies. Research limitations/implications: Implications for instructional design and pedagogy are discussed. Practical implications: The framework in which scientific information is presented may impact how students modify existing and create a new schema, impacting their beliefs about scientific knowledge and the way in which students question, hypothesize and engage within the domain of science. Social implications: By studying the role of inquiry while students engage in science learning, the authors explore the role of context, content and knowledge retention. Originality/value: The current study probes at the nature of student questioning and its reliance on the content, context and its relationship to outcome variables such as learning and, perhaps, even persistence as it relates to students' prior knowledge within content areas which may, in turn, lead to varying levels of student self-efficacy.

AB  - Due to pandemic effects all over the world, the sudden switch to distance education has doubtlessly affected primary schools more adversely in education. Concerning the pandemic period, this study aimed to examine primary school teachers' attitudes on distance education. More specifically, the survey study with 173 primary school teachers' participation examined whether teachers' attitudes towards distance education have a meaningful difference in terms of gender, age, and teaching experience. The data which was collected via the "Attitude Scale on Distance Education" were analyzed through independent samples t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results showed that there was no statistically significant difference between gender and primary school teachers' attitudes towards distance education; however, there is a statistically significant difference according to age and teaching experience. In addition, primary school teachers' attitudes towards distance education were negative. The possible reasons for these results were discussed and some implications were presented for research, practice, and policymakers. [This study' results were presented as an oral presentation at the International Symposium on Global Pandemics and Multidisciplinary COVID-19 Studies.]

AB  - The Advancing Science and Engineering through Laboratory Learning (ASELL) for Schools program has been instrumental in getting schools across Australia to reconsider the effectiveness of the laboratory learning activity (LLA) in science education. In Victoria, the ASELL for Schools project has collaborated with another nationally funded program, the Reconceptualising Maths and Science Pre-service Teacher Education Program (ReMSTEP), to integrate contemporary science and industry links into the redesign of LLAs. In this paper, we present some of the ideas that are used to re-craft an LLA, along with four case studies.

AB  - In addition to the studies conducted regarding STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematic), which is a new approach in education and attract attention worldwide, researches also concentrated on the effectiveness of the partnership of this interdisciplinary approach with other disciplines. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of an education carried out with an E-STEM activity on the environmental awareness of students and their opinions on E-STEM disciplines. In the study, a holistic multi-state pattern was used among the case study patterns. Data obtained from semi-structured interview and activity plans were analyzed using content analysis. There were 18 participants in the study conducted at a centralized public school in a province located in western Black Sea Region of Turkey, who were at 6th grade in the 2017-2018 Academic Year. The E-STEM activity prepared within the scope of the application was implemented for a total of 6 course hours for three weeks. At the end of the study, in the light of the information obtained from the participants who provide opinions on STEM disciplines, environmental awareness sub-dimensions and E-STEM, it was determined that the application had positive effects. Participants made positive statements about the environment, especially on recycling, and the use of the different disciplines together. Based on this research, it was suggested that it would be useful to develop studies on E-STEM.

AB  - There has been a growing need as preservice teachers develop competencies regarding convergence. Focused on a discussion of blended learning before the COVID-19 pandemic versus online learning in the epidemic, we aimed to explore whether preservice teachers' attitudes toward convergence can be influenced by the learning environment. Participants were a total of three hundred preservice teachers who attended the science teaching method courses training their TPACK at a teachers college in South Korea during the 2018 to 2020 academic years (194 in the blended learning group and 106 in the online learning group). Survey data on five subcomponents of attitudes toward convergence were collected at the start and end of the courses and analyzed using ANOVA and ANCOVA. As result, preservice teachers' responses to the attitudes toward convergence in the pretests have a significant difference, whereas the overall scores in the posttests revealed no significant difference in the modalities of learning environments. Consequently, the preservice teachers engaged in the courses enhanced positive attitudes toward convergence regardless of delivery methods either blended learning or online learning. This paper provides evidence that the two teaching modalities of curriculum studies have the potential to foster preservice teachers' attitudes toward convergence. This study supports that the blended and online learning formats of the course were feasible to induce short-term improvements in bias affective domains under the learning environments of science teaching method courses.

AB  - In a Swedish second semester course on Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry in mathematics education at Karlstad University, a bridging teaching strategy comprising elements from Mathematics, Didactics, History, Literature, and Technology was applied by using the concept of Narrative Didactics and Digital Interactive Mathematical Maps developed by the Professorship for Didactics of Mathematics at the University of Passau, Germany. The complete assessment of the teaching strategy comprised both an evaluation of the technological and the narrative didactical scaffolding and was partly analysed previously concerning especially the technology acceptance aspect, while here we broaden and deepen the evaluation analysis of the application of narrative didactic elements. Regarding the latter, at the end of the course, students were asked to formulate a short historical-oriented narrative motivation for a school topic of own choice with the help of information provided by the timeline of the Mathematical Map. A representative example of these art-combining products is presented and evaluated according to elements of narrative didactics. Results indicate a fruitful, promising, and synergetic connection between different fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts, and Mathematics that can lead to a richer and more sustainable learning process in mathematics lessons both at university and school level.

AB  - As science and technology create an ecosystem that is becoming increasingly more knowledge-intensive, complex, and interconnected, the next generation science standards include systems thinking and systems modeling among 21st skills that should be fostered. We examined the effect of an online cross-disciplinary learning process on the development of systems thinking and modeling skills among engineering students and engineering and science teachers. The study, which used quantitative and qualitative tools, included 55 participants who performed four food-related learning assignments and created conceptual models in Object-Process Methodology. Their responses to online assignments were analyzed along with their perceptions, captured via a reflection questionnaire. The online learning process in this study effectively enhanced systems thinking and modeling skills of all learners, including those with no relevant background. One main conclusion that extends beyond the online learning was that imparting the basics of systems thinking and conceptual modeling skills can be achieved even within a short period of time--less than one semester. The contribution of the study is the formation of theoretical and practical frameworks for the integration of an cross-disciplinary model-based systems engineering online assignments into engineering and science curricula.

AB  - Background: Transforming the culture of STEM higher education to be more inclusive and help more students reach STEM careers is challenging. Herein, we describe a new model for STEM higher education transformation, the Sustainable, Transformative Engagement across a Multi-Institution/Multidisciplinary STEM, (STEM)[superscript 2], "STEM-squared", Network. The Network embraces a pathways model, as opposed to a pipeline model, to STEM career entry. It is founded upon three strong theoretical frameworks: Communities of Transformation, systems design for organizational change, and emergent outcomes for the diffusion of innovations in STEM education. Currently composed of five institutions--three private 4-year universities and two public community colleges--the Network capitalizes on the close geographic proximity and shared student demographics to effect change across the classroom, disciplinary, institutional, and inter-institutional levels. Results: The (STEM)[superscript 2] Network has increased the extent to which participants feel empowered to be change agents for STEM higher education reform and has increased collaboration across disciplines and institutions. Participants were motivated to join the Network to improve STEM education, to improve the transfer student experience, to collaborate with colleagues across disciplines and institutions, and because they respected the leadership team. Participants continue to engage in the Network because of the collaborations created, opportunities for professional growth, opportunities to improve STEM education, and a sense that the Network is functioning as intended. Conclusion: The goal to increase the number and diversity of people entering STEM careers is predicated on transforming the STEM higher education system to embrace a pathways model to a STEM career. The (STEM)[superscript 2] Network is achieving this by empowering faculty to transform the system from the inside. While the systemic transformation of STEM higher education is challenging, the (STEM)[superscript 2] Network directly addresses those challenges by bridging disciplinary and institutional silos and leveraging the reward structure of the current system to support faculty as they work to transform this very system.

AB  - The development of STEAM education has captured researchers' attention due to its advantages for students' learning and interest in related subjects, specifically in kindergarten to grade 12 (K-12) educational settings. However, there is limited research on the inclusion of STEAM in higher education, and what university students think as they are on the professional training track. This study aimed to examine university students' attitudes towards STEAM via a 3D design project. Twenty-seven college students participated in this study. A questionnaire and focus group interviews were administered at the end of the course to uncover the students' learning enjoyment, conceptions of STEAM learning, and intentions of STEAM future design/ work involvement. The results show that the students enjoyed the 3D STEAM project regardless of their performance. High-performance students had higher conceptions of STEAM learning after the project. All of the students highly agreed that they could integrate interdisciplinary knowledge into their 3D designs. With regard to future intentions, they generally did not show an active attitude towards STEAM involvement. The students' learning enjoyment in the STEAM project did not have a strong positive correlation with their future intentions. Findings from this study could offer inspiration for artoriented courses that look for potential interdisciplinary integration and expression in STEAM.

AB  - Understanding data analysis and interpreting data are key components of teaching interdisciplinary undergraduate students. We detail a semester-long research project that introduces students to long-term data sets, incorporates the use of widely available statistical analysis, and underscores an inquiry-based method of teaching climate change. Our learning objectives included analysis of large-scale climate data and interpretation of empirical trends in the context of two climate change phenomena: warming and the urban heat island effect. We demonstrate how small groups of students (n = 2 or 3) were empowered to independently download and analyze long-term temperature data to be aggregated into a class data set. Students used the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) to find the long-term data sets of hourly maximum (TMAX) and minimum (TMIN) temperatures. Students used the open-source statistical software R to manage and summarize data. Students also examined changes in land use cover using Google Earth satellite data to quantify whether stations were urban or rural. Students were assessed in their groups based on a research paper and a class presentation. Approaching climate change education from the inquiry-based learning perspective allows students to understand how scientific research is conducted, apply the scientific method, and experience firsthand the importance of open-source data.

AB  - Project-based learning and interdisciplinary projects present an opportunity for students to learn both technical skills and other skills which are relevant to their workplace success. This paper presents an assessment of the educational impact of the OpenOrbiter program, a student-run, interdisciplinary CubeSat (a type of small satellite with dimensions of 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm and a mass of 1.33 kg) development program at the University of North Dakota, on participants with a major in computer science. The value of the program to participants is assessed in terms of key metrics through a comparison of their pre-participation and present-day levels. Particular focus is paid to identifying and quantifying the benefit of the program to students with a computer science major. The educational value of the program to computer science students is compared and contrasted to the value to students of other majors. The impact is assessed relative to their type of participation, duration of participation and other factors.

AB  - The Autonomous Vehicles (AV) are a self-driving vehicle capable of sensing its environment and operating with minimal or no human intervention converting into a fully or partially automated vehicle. These automated vehicles have great potential to revolutionize the automotive industry and our daily lives. Thus, they are receiving a lot of attention from automotive industries, governments, suppliers, educational sectors, researchers, and many other stakeholders. According to global financial service firm UBS, the AV market could reach more than $2 trillion by 2030. These projections will become reality if enough skilled workforces are produced with a high level of broad technical competencies specifically for the automotive environment. This will also require consumer education on AVs that could bring all the comfort and excitement across all segments of the population. This brings a substantial opportunity for the educational sectors in generating the workforce required in AV sectors by enhancing the existing curricula in the areas related to AVs or developing a cross-disciplinary course or capstone project that could expose students with a technical background in computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechatronics. Since AV has many technologies involved, it is challenging to design an appropriate curriculum and provide hands-on activities. Small-scale learning kits may be an affordable and effective solution for introductory courses on AVs or for beginners. This paper will discuss the use of those widely available small-scale learning kits, their benefits, and their challenges.

AB  - Setting primary science in an everyday context supports learning in a number of ways. Exploring the science associated with everyday people, places and materials helps to access pupils' prior knowledge and experience and thus facilitates a more constructivist and pupil-centred form of pedagogy. This account looks at various examples from the primary school and considers how, in addition to supporting learning in science, this approach may develop skills in numeracy, literacy and ICT. It also suggests how the teaching of science at key stages 3, 4 and 5 (ages 11-19) could be enriched by making closer connections with everyday life, particularly in the area of science enquiry

AB  - In the trend of innovating university teaching methods in the direction of student-centered learning, this article proposes the application of problem-based learning (PBL) in teaching English communication skills to engineering students at University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University. With a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, the research showed that PBL was an ideal teaching method since it enabled engineering students not only to improve their communication skills but also to apply the content knowledge in the English course. In addition, the study identified the main challenges faced by students in implementing group projects. It is hoped that this study can provide researchers and teachers with useful implications for using English as a medium of instruction in science-related subjects.

AB  - The role of anatomy in modern curricula is under reform due to competency of other rapidly evolving subjects and the rapid evolution of several practical aspects and applications dictating modernization of teaching methods as well as of teaching demands. Moreover, modern practice of medicine has put the arterial and vascular system in the center of numerous minimally invasive techniques. Therefore, regardless of their specialty, most doctors should have a very clear and precise knowledge of the vascular anatomy and the basic access techniques from the early years. This viewpoint commentary reflects the experience of the two authors in applying the principles and content of surgical vascular anatomy in undergraduate anatomy teaching and discusses the rationale of this. Moreover, it is suggested that cadaveric dissections should be modified with emphasis on standard surgical vascular exposures and the multidisciplinary teaching of vascular anatomy as a means not only to gain optimal long-term knowledge retention, but also to emphasize through realistic examples on the practical clinical value of vascular anatomy.

AB  - The blending learning model, a combination of onsite and online learning modalities formulated by relevant pedagogies, modalities, and technologies, offers learning experiences that involve the different factors shaping each modality, such as time, space, path, and pace, through sequential or parallel designs. In its relatively short history, this model has attracted much attention in the educational landscape. In this context, the main aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review of blended learning research by applying data mining and analytic approaches to identify the bibliometric trends and patterns and the thematic patterns in blended learning research and to present its intellectual structure. In brief, the results indicated that interest in blended learning research has remained steady, and that this interest peaked during the Covid-19 pandemic, when blended learning was applied to meet the new needs that emerged. Collaboration between social sciences and technology-related fields, as well as between health and medicine fields, has shaped the interdisciplinary approach to the subject. Trend analysis revealed that teacher training is a crucial factor for the success of blended learning adaptation, along with the adoption of appropriate technologies by educational institutions. Social network analysis and text mining identified four thematic patterns: (1) The comparison of online and onsite learning to benchmark the effectiveness and efficiency of modalities; (2) technology-mediated blended learning experiences; (3) teacher training and curriculum development to overcome the challenges of blended learning; and (4) dominance of the positivist paradigm in blended learning research. From the bibliometric analysis of the intellectual structure of blending learning and the determination of pivotal contributions to the subject, three emerging patterns were identified: (1) widespread theoretical and conceptual discussions; (2) higher education-oriented research; and (3) the tendency to adopt a quantitative research paradigm.

AB  - Bioinformatics education for undergraduates has been approached primarily in two ways: introduction of new courses with largely bioinformatics focus or introduction of bioinformatics experiences into existing courses. For small colleges such as Kalamazoo, creation of new courses within an already resource-stretched setting has not been an option. Furthermore, we believe that a true interdisciplinary science experience would be best served by introduction of bioinformatics modules within existing courses in biology and chemistry and other complementary departments. To that end, with support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, we have developed over a dozen independent bioinformatics modules for our students that are incorporated into courses ranging from general chemistry and biology, advanced specialty courses, and classes in complementary disciplines such as computer science, mathematics, and physics. These activities have largely promoted active learning in our classrooms and have enhanced student understanding of course materials. Herein, we describe our program, the activities we have developed, and assessment of our endeavors in this area. (Contains 7 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - There has been little real progress in finding feasible approaches to addressing global knowledge asymmetries, especially in the social sciences and humanities. With China's new global role, how Chinese experiences could contribute to global theoretical construction in the human and social sciences becomes the order of the day? As the most valued resources for human, social, and cultural theorization, Chinese thought and experiences also serve as an effective catalytic agent for global intellectual pluralism. The great value of China's intellectual traditions in global theoretical construction fuels Chinese scholarship in the humanities and social sciences to win a reputation on the world stage.

AB  - Background: Nanotechnology, a multidisciplinary field with increasing societal importance, demands for an increase in research abilities and capacities. Yet, nanoscience and nanotechnology (NST) are largely inaccessible to K-12 students. This situation demands efforts in research towards bringing NST learning into K-12 classrooms. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the outcomes of an application-based nanotechnology module, developed for late middle school students. The study focused on exploring student readiness to unpack unfamiliar NST concepts, and the effects engagement with NST had on student attitudes towards STEM subjects. Purpose: Participants included a total of three science teachers and 169, grade 8 and 9 students from two public school districts from a northeastern state of the USA over two years. Data was collected and used from students who consented for the study. Design and Methods: The NST learning module was developed in three phases, beginning with an introductory session to discuss module content and design. We then designed a module for implementation. Drawing from results from the pilot module and teacher inputs, we revised the pilot module for this study. Surveys, content questionnaires, student reflections, and classroom videos were collected for analysis. Results: Students demonstrated conceptual understanding of the working of the AFM after working closely with the tool. Our data highlights students' readiness to unpack unfamiliar NST concepts. Despite no significant changes, we noticed increases in students' attitudes towards STEM subjects and careers, and an increase in the number of students who plan to take advanced STEM courses. Conclusion: Based on our results, we suggest the use of technology-based experiences to introduce novel ideas of NST as early as eighth grade. The technology-based approach created a new space for contextualized learning. Working with teachers is critical to creating new teaching-learning experiences for K-12 learning, especially in the context of NST.

AB  - With an increased emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, educators have often adopted engineering projects for integrating interdisciplinary knowledge through engineering design process. However, there is scant research that has empirically documented the relationships among students' understanding of the knowledge and their characteristics on the design product. This study uses structural equation modeling to examine the influence of students' scientific knowledge, design process, and critical thinking on their design product of the engineering project. A theoretical model was constructed to identify the factors that affected the design product. Study data were collected from 613 high school students, aged 16-17 years, regarding their scientific knowledge, design processes, and critical thinking. The results showed that design process played a mediating role in the effects of knowledge and critical thinking on the final design product. Students who could deduce, explain, and evaluate had an increased ability to apply scientific knowledge during the design process. These results indicate that scientific knowledge has an effect on the process and products of engineering projects completed by high school students. This study also suggested that the science and technology education community should consider offering high school students learning opportunities to promote their cognitive skills and facilitate connections between knowledge and practice.

AB  - Inquiry-based education has been part of innovative science teaching for the last few decades. With the competence orientation now underlying many national curricula, one of the emerging questions is how the development of student competences can be fostered in the context of inquiry-based science education. One approach to supporting students in their learning is formative assessment, which is, however, not frequently used in a structured way in daily teaching practice. The aim of this study therefore is to explore what kinds of measures might support science teachers in implementing formative assessment activities in their inquiry-based education. For this, firstly, we investigated the challenges that occur on a classroom level when using formative assessment methods in inquiry-based science education from teachers' perspectives. Secondly, we analyzed the teachers' suggestions on measures of support. Based on the respective results, this paper discusses implications for an implementation of structured formative assessment in inquiry-based science education to enhance student competences.

AB  - This study employed survey method for exploring views of teachers toward science, technology, reading, engineering, arts and math science, technology, reading, engineering, arts and math (STREAM) education. Primary teachers were asked their views through questionnaires after STREAM education workshop. Results revealed that teachers have holistic view and having positive view towards STREAM education even though all of them are not science or mathematics teachers. Change in belief and way of practices can allow teachers to do STREAM education in every classroom, design-based learning and creative classroom should be promoted as well. However, holistic view will be more effective into classroom, technology and other supporting learning environments should be prepared.

AB  - This study investigated the influence of immersive classroom simulation activities on the development of elementary pre-service teachers in two separate mathematics and science education courses that simultaneously focus on pedagogy and content. Participants submitted written personal reflections about their teaching experiences using the immersive classroom simulation activities. These reflections were analyzed for common emergent themes within and across courses. The participants discussed the benefits of the immersive classroom simulation activities in their written personal reflections. They viewed the experience as helpful in developing their skills as a practicing teacher in mathematics and science. Specifically, participants identified three sub-themes including: (a) the immersive classroom simulation activities as being beneficial by providing more authentic real-life teaching experiences than those experienced during peer-group teaching activities; (b) the importance of holding complete and appropriate understandings of content when teaching mathematics and science; and (c) the role of deep content knowledge in the process of developing high quality questions for students. This study has shown immersive classroom simulation activities to be a viable alternative for teacher education programs to engage elementary preservice teachers in developing skills regarding classroom mathematics and science discourse.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to discuss the implementation of case-based teaching and use of response technologies to graduate students in a food science course. The article focuses on teaching sensory science and sensometrics, presents several concrete examples used during the course, and discusses in each case some of the observed outcomes. Students' evaluations, peer feedback, and self-observations throughout the course collectively indicated that the particular initiatives were effective in engaging student participation and promoting a more active way of learning. Case-based teaching provided students with the opportunity to apply their knowledge and their analytical skills to complex, real-life scenarios relevant to the subject matter. The use of audience response systems further facilitated class discussion and was extremely well received by the students; this resulted in a more enjoyable classroom experience.

AB  - The term "polymath" refers to a person whose expertise approaches different subject areas, to rely on complex packages of knowledge for solving problems. Famous polymaths from history include Galileo Galilei, Leonardo da Vinci, Mozart, and Albert Einstein; individuals that have impacted science, arts, humanities, and our society for centuries. However, from a neuropsychological point of view and social perspective, it is unclear whether these gifted subjects developed their abilities because of inherited neurobiological or anatomical differences when compared to average people, or their skills and functional advantages were a result of specific environmental factors or stimulus inducing brain plasticity changes that reflect in cognitive improvements. In this discussion report, we present literature evidence from basic health sciences supporting the hypothesis that polymaths may be "born" based on their individual genetic characteristics but also "trained" by surrounding environmental factors or stimulus. At the functional level, polymaths may have a number advantages regarding creativity, resilience, and versatility. Since educational strategies are nowadays more focused on specialization rather than developing multidisciplinary professionals for the future, one could speculate whether these conventional approaches should be updated to stimulate polymathy in future generations.

AB  - This article reviews the personal and professional processes of developing an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the complex issues of environmental health in their community, political-economic, social science, and scientific contexts. This interdisciplinary approach includes a synthesis of research, policy work, and advocacy. To examine multiple forms of interdisciplinarity, I examine pathways of integrating medical and environmental sociology via three challenges to the boundaries of traditional research: (1) crossing the boundaries of medical and environmental sociology, (2) linking social science and environmental health science, and (3) crossing the boundary of research and advocacy. These boundary crossings are discussed in light of conceptual and theoretical developments of popular epidemiology, contested illnesses, and health social movements. This interdisciplinary work offers a more comprehensive sociological lens for understanding complex problems and a practical ability to join with scientists, activists, and officials to meet public health needs for amelioration and prevention of environmental health threats.

AB  - This book contains a compilation of papers presented at the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2018), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (WIARS). Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2018 received 624 submissions, from more than 50 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. The conference accepted for presentation 168 submissions (27% acceptance rate). The conference also includes two keynote presentations from internationally distinguished researchers, Prof. Dr. Zoltán Rónay (Ph.D, Associate Professor) Research Group for Higher Education and Innovation, Institute of Education, Faculty of Education and Psychology, Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary, and Prof. Dr. Gyöngyi Bujdosó (PhD, Senior lecturer) Faculty of Informatics, University of Debrecen, Hungary, to whom we express our most gratitude. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. To develop the conference program, we have chosen four main broad-ranging categories, which also covers different interest areas: (1) In TEACHERS AND STUDENTS: Teachers and Staff training and education; Educational quality and standards; Curriculum and Pedagogy; Vocational education and Counseling; Ubiquitous and lifelong learning; Training programs and professional guidance; Teaching and learning relationship; Student affairs (learning, experiences and diversity); Extra-curricular activities; Assessment and measurements in Education. (2) In PROJECTS AND TRENDS: Pedagogic innovations; Challenges and transformations in Education; Technology in teaching and learning; Distance Education and eLearning; Global and sustainable developments for Education; New learning and teaching models; Multicultural and (inter)cultural communications; Inclusive and Special Education; Rural and indigenous Education; Educational projects. (3) In TEACHING AND LEARNING: Critical Thinking; Educational foundations; Research and development methodologies; Early childhood and Primary Education; Secondary Education; Higher Education; Science and technology Education; Literacy, languages and Linguistics (TESL/TEFL); Health Education; Religious Education; Sports Education. (4) In ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES: Educational policy and leadership; Human Resources development; Educational environment; Business, Administration, and Management in Education; Economics in Education; Institutional accreditations and rankings; International Education and Exchange programs; Equity, social justice and social change; Ethics and values; Organizational learning and change, Corporate Education. This book contains the results of the research and developments conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to promote growth in research methods intimately related to teaching, learning and applications in Education nowadays. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, who will extend our view in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues, by sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. We would like to express thanks to all the authors and participants, the members of the academic scientific committee, and of course, to our organizing and administration team for making and putting this conference together.

AB  - Research students in social science disciplines frequently struggle to master statistical analysis. A contributing factor may be the statistical software that is used, as the design of such software may not address the needs of non-statisticians or non-computer programming students. Hence, decisions about which statistical software tools are most suitable for such end-users need to be made at the introductory level. This paper first identifies key human-computer interaction (HCI) factors that may directly influence students' statistical analysis performance. Factors include technical properties such as user interface design, statistical features available, visualization, data handling, preparation, and manipulation, and usage properties such as speed/number of steps, ease of command/use, and efficiency. Four popular software systems (ie, SPSS, R within RStudio Desktop, R Commander & jamovi) were evaluated. Findings suggest that HCI usage factors from an interaction perspective are likely to be especially important for students gaining an introductory knowledge of statistics.

AB  - Quantitative reasoning and interdisciplinary skills are central to real-world environmental problem solving. Enhancing those skills for students in environmental programs will help them succeed as future environmental professionals. This paper describes an approach that uses an applied geophysical imaging course to enhance quantitative reasoning and interdisciplinary learning in an environmental geography program. To adapt the course to geography students, applied learning is emphasized through the high-impact educational practices (HEPs) of undergraduate research and service learning. Throughout the course, students learn the theories of, and utilize electrical resistivity (ER), ground penetrating radar (GPR), and electromagnetic (EM) induction methods to answer real-life environmental questions in the local community. Course evaluations indicate that the course produced positive learning outcomes consistent with the course objectives. Similarly, students appreciate the unique opportunity to learn and utilize these technologies that are not commonly found within geography programs. The teaching strategies described in this paper can benefit other faculty contemplating curricular integration for interdisciplinary learning and quantitative reasoning outcomes.

AB  - This contribution will outline the development of a specific approach of theoretical educational thinking in Germany, associated with the notions of "Didaktik"/didactics and "Fachdidaktik"/subject-matter didactics as well as its comparative, generalized form called "General Subject Didactics" (GSD). The first one deals with the 'art and science of teaching' in general, whereas the second and third one relate to disciplines of subject-matter teaching and learning in school. We will start with analysing "didactics" being in a crisis, leading to the strengthening of "subject didactics" in its place. Yet subject didactics has its own limitations and weaknesses. We will argue that these can be overcome with the help of "General Subject Didactics" which observes, compares and analyses the different subject didactics from a higher point of view: this approach can help understand the educational practice of one specific subject better and deeper, but also help moving beyond particular experiences and boundaries within that framework, towards looking at neighbouring subjects, at cross-curricular networking and cooperation. We will demonstrate how this might support the development of a powerful educational knowledge base for specialized subject teachers and their practice as educators as well as for continued professional development.

AB  - In the DISCUSS (Dialogic Inquiry for Socioscientific and Conceptual Understanding in School Science) research project, a Socioscientific Issues (SSI)-based curriculum is developed and implemented in sixth-grade science classrooms with predominantly English language learners (ELLs) in Houston, Texas. A four-week space unit is designed in collaboration with researchers and science teachers to improve students' science content knowledge, reasoning and argumentation, and academic language through dialogic inquiry of a central question: "Should the U.S. government increase or decrease funding for space exploration?" The unique features of the curriculum include the expansion of 5E instructional model to the 7E model for ELLs, the use of classroom discussions to facilitate reasoning and argumentation, and the integration of effective literacy strategies in lessons. Students investigate four-domain issues--technology, environment, economy, and public policy--associated with space exploration by reading argument texts, engaging in teacher-led whole class discussions and peer-led small-group discussions, and hands-on group work. At the end of the unit, students write an individual decision letter to address the central question. The multidisciplinary DISCUSS curriculum is promising to help teachers create language-rich science classrooms and promote science learning, reasoning and argumentation, and academic language development of all students especially ELLs.

AB  - Background: Although plant reproduction is a core subject in school science curricula, botanical topics are typically unpopular with students. Integrating the arts into science subject matter has the potential to increase student interest and understanding. Educational theatre has shown particular promise in this area. Purpose: The study examined how an interactive theatre performance, where professional actors deliver a performance but invite regular audience participation as a way to promote active learning, benefited both understanding of plant reproduction and attitudes towards plants. Perceptions of the play and the way in which specific elements influenced learning and emotions were examined in detail and placed in a theoretical context. Sample: Opportunity sampling was used to recruit participants from five public primary schools in Devon, UK. One hundred and forty-four students (aged 9-11 years) participated in the study. Design and methods: A mixed methods approach was adopted. Quantitative analysis of pre- and post-intervention knowledge tests involved t-tests and repeated measures ANCOVA. Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews made use of an emerging theme analysis with "a priori" categories. Results: Pre- and post-intervention tests indicated an increase in both knowledge of plant reproduction and positive attitudes towards plants. Follow-up interviews identified elements that were particularly beneficial for learning and enjoyment, including the thematic singing, humour, novelty of the play, visual elements and participatory art activities. Conclusions: This case study demonstrates the potential that an interactive theatre production offers for enhancing appreciation and interest in school science while improving knowledge.

AB  - In this paper, we propose that informal aspects of data science could be introduced in primary school. The International Data Science in Schools Project (IDSSP) framework for data science curriculum provides a guide for a data science curriculum aimed at upper secondary level. We analyzed synergies between the IDSSP framework and the current content of the Australian Curriculum at the primary school level (ages 5-11) for Mathematics, Digital Technologies, and two General Capabilities (ICT, Critical and Creative Thinking). Our findings suggest that the primary curriculum already exists to support informal, age-appropriate data science content for young children. A vignette of a Year 4 (age 9) class is used to illustrate what such a curriculum could look like in practice.

AB  - Age-appropriate children's books can be an effective way to introduce and discuss issues of social justice with young students. These books can be the anchor for interdisciplinary lessons that integrate core content areas, such as language arts, science, and/or social studies with the visual and performing arts to enrich students' learning experiences. Examples of critical social justice issues include child labor, universal literacy, racism, water and air pollution, climate change, deforestation, refugees and immigration, war, hunger, and global health.
