AB  - Innovations from the United States have often led the world to new discoveries and solutions to complex problems. However, there are alarming indications that the United States is falling behind other countries in the ability to apply science, technology, engineering, and math to complex problems facing our world. In order for the country to maintain its position in global business and as a major innovator, there is a need for educators to rededicate their efforts in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). State College Area School District's Park Forest Middle School organized and implemented the state's first STEM Education interdisciplinary team. This group of science, technology education, and math teachers work in a cross-curricular format to develop engineering projects and events to enlighten their students, parents, and community members about these disciplines. In the fall of 2009, the school's building principal, Dr. Karen Wiser, challenged the faculty to come up with activities to brighten students' afternoons following the Pennsylvania PSSA tests. Within the next few hours, the STEM Education team met and painted the broad strokes of what would become known as the STEM Education Fair. This article presents a narrative of how to organize an event that will capture both the minds and imaginations of students while reaping accolades from administrators and community.

AB  - This article provides an example of a social studies lesson from Turkish educational context in order to facilitate comparison with examples of social studies lessons from other parts of the world. This lesson was recorded in a 7th grade class at a middle school in one of the metropolitan neighborhoods in Istanbul. According to the current curriculum in Turkey, social studies education is an interdisciplinary field (TTKB, 2009b; 2009c). The subjects of social studies include history, geography, economics, sociology, anthropology, psychology, philosophy, political science, law, and civics (TTKB, 2009b; 2009c). Social studies courses are taught under two different titles in elementary and middle schools from the first through seventh grades in Turkey. In early grades (grades 1-3), the course is called Life Studies (see TTKB, 2009a) and, from grades four through seven, it is called Social Studies. nation. At the high school level (Grades 9-12), social studies subjects are taught as discipline based courses such as history, geography, sociology, psychology, and philosophy. Educational research studies in Turkey are dominated by surveys and questionnaires. Thus, generally school administrators and teachers limit educational research only to these kinds of surveys which they call "anket". "Anket" is originally a French word "enquête" and has been integrated into Turkish to mean "public poll" or "questionnaire". Therefore, this type of educational research which required a video recording of a class session was unconventional for the school administrators and teachers and they were not eager to participate in this research. The lesson was video recorded and transcribed verbatim. Then, the transcripts in Turkish were translated into English. Explanations were given in brackets when necessary. Transcription and translation process were not easy. Some issues came up especially with the translation as some words lose their meaning when translated to English. Two sessions covering the same topic were recorded. Nevertheless, for reasons of space, only the first session was prepared for this issue, with a summary of the second lesson provided.

AB  - A kindergarten class learns about inventions, inventors, and how to be an inventor. Engaging students in learning about pencil sharpeners led to researching and developing a lesson plan designed so students could learn how inventions are solutions to problems. Through identifying, researching, and brainstorming new inventions, the students practiced inventing a solution for a mock problem. As a class, in small groups, and individually, students were able to use scientific inquiry by posing questions, designing, and building solutions with natural and human-made materials. They tested their inventions, revised them, and reported results to the class. This lesson integrated subjects such as language arts, social studies, math, and art while meeting national science education standards. (Contains 2 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - This article features the workshop titled Exploring New Environments, developed by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's DESTINY Traveling Science Learning Program. Exploring New Environments is a teacher professional development model based on the idea that teachers are also learners who thrive when given the means and encouragement to explore fresh intellectual worlds. Teachers can creatively use what they learn to increase their students' interest in and understanding of science. The author also features DESTINY, a pre-college program that promotes equity of access to high-quality science education for all students. Science teachers are DESTINY's primary focus. The program sought to involve teachers of other disciplines in the process of science education. It initiated its interdisciplinary approach with Frankenstein's Fingerprints, a module that deals with genetics, scientific discovery and ethics, and students' critical-thinking skills. Workshops such as Exploring New Environments have the potential to garner nonscience collaborators for science teachers and also can encourage and prepare nonscience teachers to independently reinforce scientific content in their classrooms.

AB  - This paper presents results from a July 2005 workshop and course aimed at developing an interdisciplinary course on modeling aquatic ecosystems that will provide the next generation of practitioners with critical skills for which formal training is presently lacking. Five different course models were evaluated: (1) fundamentals/general principles of interdisciplinary modeling; (2) modular course; (3) survey of various interdisciplinary models; (4) seminar series of case studies; and (5) the art of modeling. Options 1 and 2 were most popular among workshop participants, while option 4 was the least popular. (Contains 2 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - The aim of the present study is to improve the quality of students' environmental literacy and sustainability education in chemistry teaching by combining the socio-scientific issue of life-cycle thinking with inquiry-based learning approaches. This case study presents results from an inquiry-based life-cycle thinking project: an interdisciplinary teaching model designed by chemistry teachers. The strength of the project is that upper-secondary students (N = 105) are allowed to investigate the life cycle of an optional product based on their own interest. Student-centred teaching methods are suggested to promote the students' interest in studying. The research question was: How does an inquiry-based life-cycle thinking project in chemistry education affect students' chemistry attitudes and environmental literacy? The research methods used included surveys and semi-structured interviews. The study shows that the project positively affected students' attitudes towards chemistry learning: they valued the independent and collaborative learning setting. The changes in the students' environmental literacy were evident in their new realisations: they emphasised the importance of environmental protection and recycling, but perceived that changing their own behaviour is still difficult. The inquiry-based teaching of life-cycle thinking can be seen as an effective approach to more motivating and sustainable chemistry education. Further research should address the kinds of knowledge outcomes that this type of inquiry-based life-cycle teaching creates in students. Furthermore, other useful approaches to teaching sustainable development in chemistry lessons should be shared.

AB  - Science programmes which prepare students to read critically and respond thoughtfully to science-based reports in the media could play an important role in promoting informed participation in the public debate about issues relating to science, technology and society. Evidence based guidance about the practice and pattern of use of science-based media in the classroom is limited. This study sought to identify learning intentions that teachers believe ought to underpin the development of programmes of study designed to achieve this end-result. Teachers' views of knowledge, skills and attitudes required to engage critically with science-based news served as a basis for this study. Teachers developed a pedagogical model by selecting appropriate statements of learning intentions, grouping these into coherent and manageable themes and coding them according to perceived level of difficulty. The model is largely compatible with current curricular provision in the UK, highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and illustrates the developmental nature of the topic.

AB  - Education research changed significantly with the passage of the Education Science Reform Act of 2002. That legislation created the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) within the U.S. Department of Education, forever changing research in education broadly writ, including school psychology. The creation of IES served many purposes, from defining education as a scientific discipline to encouraging research designs based on the premise that they make causal inferences more tenable. Something had to change, and IES brought about this shift.

AB  - Despite significant advances in the field of social neuroscience, much remains to be understood regarding the development and maintenance of social skills across the life span. Few comprehensive models exist that integrate multidisciplinary perspectives and explain the multitude of factors that influence the emergence and expression of social skills. Here, a developmental biopsychosocial model (SOCIAL) is offered that incorporates the biological underpinnings and socio-cognitive skills that underlie social function (attention/executive function, communication, socio-emotional skills), as well as the internal and external (environmental) factors that mediate these skills. The components of the model are discussed in the context of the social brain network and are supported by evidence from 3 conditions known to affect social functioning (autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and traumatic brain injury). This integrative model is intended to provide a theoretical structure for understanding the origins of social dysfunction and the factors that influence the emergence of social skills through childhood and adolescence in both healthy and clinical populations.

AB  - In a constantly and rapidly changing social world, students from all disciplines ought to attain a rounded education within the tradition of a "Liberal Arts and Sciences" (LAS) context. Students outside of the natural sciences must be encouraged to appreciate the place of those sciences in their lives. Conversely, students in the natural sciences must be encouraged to envision the role of other subjects in their lives. In order to accomplish this, however, we need to go beyond basic instructional approaches by applying alternatives such as using magazines and newspapers. This paper reports students' reflections on the use of newspapers as supplementary instructional materials to enhance learning. Data were collected from an introductory liberal arts physics course using a survey instrument. The survey had five descriptive measures: student perceptions; creativity based on activities learned; ability to link concepts learned in class to articles in the news journal; ability to impart knowledge acquired; and identifying lessons based on a case study of a selected news article from the newspaper. Student reflections indicate that magazines can effect a positive learning experience and stimulate curiosity to read. It is concluded that this approach can be used to enhance student motivation and persistence in introductory classes, particularly in schools where resources are limited.

AB  - A science teacher has the advantage of hooking learners with all their senses: flashes, bangs and smells. The science labs are something that many learners at the start of secondary school (high school) are eager to explore, and when there is an open day at school it feels unfair that the mathematics department has to try to compete for excitement with the liquid nitrogen and explosions on display in the science area. The author argues that there is nothing wrong with being a science teacher, but school science teaching is full of restrictions. On the contrary, mathematics teachers are lucky because they do not have to be a control freak in the classroom. What the author loves about teaching mathematics is that learners can explore without permission--no teacher needs to impede their thinking by fencing off areas and telling them they are too young or too inexperienced or too clumsy to go there. The author loves the way that learners of mathematics can take control and come to conclusions that they "know" are right, not because someone tells them so but because they have reasoned it out for themselves.

AB  - This article surveys historical scholarship on science education over the last 15 years and lays out a map of the different approaches to writing about this topic found in a variety of disciplines and fields. The hope is to provide scholars interested in science education past and present a better understanding of how this enterprise has functioned in western culture, both in terms of training future scientists and managing the relationship between science and the lay public. Highlighted in this article is the compartmentalised nature of current work which, I argue, presents an obstacle to more productive thinking about the history of science education in modern society.

AB  - In May 2008, the worst earthquake in more than three decades struck southwest China, killing more than 80,000 people. The complexity of this earthquake makes it an ideal case study to clarify the intertwined issues of ethics in engineering and to help cultivate critical thinking skills. This paper first explores the need to encourage engineering ethics within a cross-cultural context. Next, it presents a systematic model for designing an engineering ethics curriculum based on moral development theory and ethic dilemma analysis. Quantitative and qualitative data from students' oral and written work were collected and analysed to determine directions for improvement. The paper also presents results of an assessment of this interdisciplinary engineering ethics course. This investigation of a disaster is limited strictly to engineering ethics education; it is not intended to assign blame, but rather to spark debate about ethical issues.

AB  - Reform efforts are often unsuccessful because they failed to understand that teachers play a key role in making educational reforms successful. This paper describes a long-term teacher professional development (PD) program aimed at educating and training teachers to teach interdisciplinary topics using case-based method in science. The research objective was to identify, follow and document the processes that science teachers went through as they assimilated the interdisciplinary, case-based science teaching approach. The research accompanied the PD program throughout its 3-year period. About 50 teachers, who took part in the PD program, were exposed to an interdisciplinary case-based teaching method. The research instruments included teacher portfolios, which contained projects and reflection questionnaires, classroom observations, teacher interviews, and student feedback questionnaires. The portfolios contained the projects that the teachers had carried out during the PD program, which included case studies and accompanying student activities. We found that the teachers gradually moved from exposure to new teaching methods and subject matter, through active learning and preparing case-based team projects, to interdisciplinary, active classroom teaching using the case studies they developed.

AB  - We welcome you to the International Conference on Education and New Developments 2014, taking place in Madrid, Spain, from 28 to 30 of June, 2014. Education, as an important right in our contemporary world, began since we exist. Knowledge and skills were passed by adults to the young, and cultures began to extend their experiences through various forms. Schools and academies were formed since the most ancient civilizations. Although between innumerous difficulties, these experiences were capable to teach us how to develop better formative effects and to turn education a generalized and global right. Formal education and other educational practices are used by all of us in the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. This international conference seeks to provide explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. Our goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2014 received over more 292 submissions, from 40 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. It were accepted for presentation in the conference, 83 submissions (28% acceptance rate). The conference also includes a keynote presentation from the distinguished Professor Hanna David, Tel Aviv University (Emerita), Israel, to whom we express our most gratitude. This volume is composed by the proceedings of the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2014), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (W.I.A.R.S.) and co-sponsored by the respected partners we reference in the dedicated page. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. To develop the conference program we have chosen four main broad-ranging categories, which also covers different interest areas: (1) In TEACHERS AND STUDENTS: Teachers and Staff training and education; Educational quality and standards; Curriculum and Pedagogy; Vocational education and Counseling; Ubiquitous and lifelong learning; Training programs and professional guidance; Teaching and learning relationship; Student affairs (learning, experiences and diversity; Extracurricular activities; Assessment and measurements in Education. (2) In PROJECTS AND TRENDS: Pedagogic innovations; Challenges and transformations in Education; Technology in teaching and learning; Distance Education and eLearning; Global and sustainable developments for Education; New learning and teaching models; Multicultural and (inter)cultural communications; Inclusive and Special Education; Rural and indigenous Education; Educational projects. (3) In TEACHING AND LEARNING: Educational foundations; Research and development methodologies; Early childhood and Primary Education; Secondary Education; Higher Education; Science and technology Education; Literacy, languages and Linguistics (TESL/TEFL); Health Education; Religious Education; Sports Education. (4) In ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES: Educational policy and leadership; Human Resources development; Educational environment; Business, Administration, and Management in Education; Economics in Education; Institutional accreditations and rankings; International Education and Exchange programs; Equity, social justice and social change; Ethics and values; Organizational learning and change. The proceedings contain the results of the research and developments conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to promote growth in research methods intimately related to teaching, learning and applications in Education nowadays. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, who will extend our view in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues, by sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences.

AB  - Internationally in secondary schools, lessons are typically taught by subject specialists, raising the question of how to accommodate teaching which bridges the sciences and humanities. This is the first study to look at how students make sense of the teaching they receive in two subjects (science and religious education [RE]) when one subject's curriculum explicitly refers to cross-disciplinary study and the other does not. Interviews with 61 students in seven schools in England suggested that students perceive a permeable boundary between science and their learning in science lessons and also a permeable boundary between religion and their learning in RE lessons, yet perceive a firm boundary between science lessons and RE lessons. We concluded that it is unreasonable to expect students to transfer instruction about cross-disciplinary perspectives across such impermeable subject boundaries. Finally, we consider the implications of these findings for the successful management of cross-disciplinary education.

AB  - An interdisciplinary and context-driven course focused on global water issues was developed and taught at the college level. Students designed a semester-long research project, collected and analyzed data, and ultimately presented their results and conclusions to the larger community. As a result of the course, students' science literacy improved as did their curiosity and confidence in the science field. Students self-reported that they were more interested in the topic and saw connections to the course and other disciplines and real-world issues. They concluded that their ability to think through a problem increased as a result of the course. Finally, students reported that their enthusiasm and appreciation for the subject increased over the semester. (Contains 2 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - The authors have developed and implemented a novel general education science course that examines scientific knowledge, laboratory experimentation, and science-related public policy through the lens of feminist science studies. They argue that this approach to teaching general science education is useful for improving science literacy. Goals for science literacy for nonscience majors are discussed. They used pre- and post-surveys (Likert scale), exam scores, and classroom assessments to examine the impact of this course on students. A final analysis shows that students made significant gains in science content knowledge, increased their confidence in learning science (content and experimental work), and increased their understanding of feminist analysis of science and science-related public policy.

AB  - "Internationalisation" has become the new buzzword for universities around the world, with jointly offered degrees as well as smaller-scale exchanges for students. Despite this rapid expansion of international campuses and programmes, and the increasing acceptance and encouragement of international experiences for [post]graduate students, little comprehensive evaluative work has been done to assess their efficacy on a broad scale and to determine what types and models of international work can be most effective. The lack of reliable and comprehensive data is especially problematic for science and engineering fields, where academic staff anxieties about forming students into competent scientists often collide with enthusiasm for encouraging international collaborations. Questions of exactly what makes a competent, or excellent, scientist, and what may benefit the scientific domain, do not have easy--or agreed-upon--answers. This article assesses the current state of internationalisation and international experiences, focusing in particular on science and engineering fields. It discusses initial results from a workshop, sponsored by the US National Science Foundation and organised by the Center for Innovation and Research in Graduate Education at the University of Washington, to develop an interdisciplinary research agenda aimed at launching and coordinating empirically driven research on international graduate education. It concludes by identifying areas for future research. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - In an era in which time is more compressed than it has ever been before, the life cycle of any innovation is extremely brief, and an unexpected, bold idea that is quickly put to work in the sphere of virtual reality can result in a "super-breakthrough" in the world of new industrial technologies. In order to accomplish cutting-edge technological tasks it is essential to provide for the appropriate training of specialists, based on the integration of education, science, and production. Today's engineers have to pursue the accomplishment of multicriterial tasks; they have to single out, on a well-reasoned basis, the factors that are the most important, model the options that are possible in principle, and select those that are to be given priority on the basis of scientifically substantiated and morally permissible criteria. The quality of the results of the intellectual endeavors of college students, work that is designed to make them ready to engage in creative, innovative professional activity, is very definitely affected by the level of the use of general, interdisciplinary technological knowledge in the learning process. The question of systematizing information that is difficult to formalize is of general importance. It is relevant not only in the sphere of technical education but also in numerous fields of scientific and production activity, where the concentration of common interests leads to raising of the level of integration of the "education--science--production" system. Solving the problem of systematizing information that is of different kinds requires the formulation of an appropriate methodology. In solving problems that have to do with the implementation of the interdisciplinary training of engineers, a methodology for systematizing interdisciplinary information has been tested successfully. This article describes this methodology which is based on the formation of decision-making data bases (DMDB). The results achieved in this field can be used effectively not only to accomplish tasks of production but also to deal with problems of continuous education.

AB  - Science and art are traditionally represented as two disciplines with completely divergent goals, methods, and public. It has been claimed that, if rightly addressed, science and art education could mutually support each other. In this paper I propose the recurrent reference to certain famous paintings during the ordinary progress of physics courses in secondary schools, in order to convey, in a memorable way, some basic features of physics methodology. For an understanding of the overall characteristics of science should be regarded as one of the crucial goals of physics education. As a part of a general education, the forgetting of physics concepts may be acceptable, but failing to grasp the very nature of science is not. Images may help in conveying the nature of science, especially for humanities-oriented students. Moreover, famous paintings, with their familiarity and availability, are a valid tool in facilitating this.

AB  - This paper examines the framings that the fields of the social studies of science and science education use for each other. It is shown that the social studies of science frames science education as passive and timeless. Science education frames science studies as a set of representations to better capture how science works. The paper then proceeds to sketch an alternative in which schools are understood, drawing on actor-network theory and cultural studies of science, as constituted through contesting scientific practices and discourses and, therefore, are proper objects of study within science studies frameworks. The curricular implications are briefly developed, emphasizing the need for much more reflection upon and activism within science education regarding the technoscientific constitution of students and schools.

AB  - The Maker Movement has been received by the field of K--12 education with great enthusiasm as a way of teaching STEM content to children. We call attention to and identify learning opportunities in children's projects created in a playful, informal environment with easily available materials. In keeping with research in the field of maker education and learning sciences, we describe tinkering as a constructionist learning activity in which meaning making is captured through transitional objects (Bamberger, 1995). First, we examine one specific tinkering project and identify transitional objects within the project. Next, we discuss the process of meaning making as captured through the transitional objects and identify the significance of children's emerging views of scientific concepts. Finally, we discuss implications for adopting the concept of transitional objects for capturing children's meaning making and learning in the domains of K--12 science and engineering education.

AB  - In an online graduate paleontology course taken by practicing Earth Science teachers, we designed an investigation using teachers' local informal educational environments. Teachers (N = 28) were responsible for photographing, describing, and integrating fossil specimens from two informal sites into a paleoenvironmental analysis of the landscape in which the fossils were originally deposited. Our practicing teachers also developed mini-units for their individual classrooms, utilizing the fossils and the informal sites they investigated. Not only did teachers develop a multitude of innovative and effective activities, but they were overwhelmingly enthusiastic about incorporating aspects of local informal sites within their individual classrooms. Content analysis of teachers' anonymous responses revealed three stable findings: 1) The informal sites and local fossils affirmed the importance of the local environment and put it into a larger context, 2) directed student activities within informal sites can maximize learning, and 3) informal sites provide a context for information and can supply an interdisciplinary "big picture" for students. We propose that directed interdisciplinary investigations that incorporate the local environment may enhance science learning at informal education sites. (Contains 4 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - Developing and implementing relevant, challenging, integrative, and exploratory curriculum is critical at all levels of schooling. This article describes one attempt to develop and implement an instance of interdisciplinary curriculum by using copy change with trade books to teach earth science. Specifically, it introduces trade books as a way to integrate science and literacy and address national science and literacy content standards. It also describes using copy change to teach earth science in a fifth-grade classroom and shares samples of student work that resulted from this engagement. It ends with reflections of the experience and final thoughts for integrating science and literacy at all levels of schooling. (Contains 7 figures and 4 tables.)

AB  - Amber is a fossil by itself, and can also contain plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Some of these perfectly preserved specimens give scientists a convenient window to past environments, including the biology, ecology, geology, and chemistry of Earth's past. By using an interdisciplinary approach, we can demonstrate to students a more accurate representation of the scientific community, which does not work in isolation. (Contains 6 figures.)

AB  - Recent advances involving high-throughput techniques for data generation and analysis have made familiarity with basic bioinformatics concepts and programs a necessity in the biological sciences. Undergraduate students increasingly need training in methods related to finding and retrieving information stored in vast databases. The rapid rise of bioinformatics as a new discipline has challenged many colleges and universities to keep current with their curricula, often in the face of static or dwindling resources. On the plus side, many bioinformatics modules and related databases and software programs are free and accessible online, and interdisciplinary partnerships between existing faculty members and their support staff have proved advantageous in such efforts. We present examples of strategies and methods that have been successfully used to incorporate bioinformatics content into undergraduate curricula.

AB  - A qualitative model of a system is an abstraction that captures ordinal knowledge and predicts the set of qualitatively possible behaviours of the system, given a qualitative description of its structure and initial state. This paper examines an innovative approach to science education using an interactive learning environment that supports learners in expressing and simulating conceptual knowledge by building qualitative models in ecology. The learning environment and tools are being developed as part of the DynaLearn qualitative modeling research project, funded by the European Union's 7th framework programme and carried out by a consortium of eight participant universities. In summing up the results, it is clear that from the perspective of systems thinking, the modeling activity affected students' perception of systems making them able to represent it in a more dynamic and comprehensive way.

AB  - In life sciences, the internet is an indispensable medium for research, but has not yet realized its full potential for teaching. The concept of e-learning has been developed over the past decades for undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate programs. We set up an e-learning lecture on cancer biology and pharmacology that was first offered in 2003 to students of Molecular Biotechnology at the University of Heidelberg and to students of Pharmacy at the University of Mainz, Germany. The present paper recapitulates the first decade of experiences with this e-learning lecture from both the students' and the teachers' perspectives. A total of 317 students during the past 10 years participated in a survey. In general, the students enjoyed the possibilities that self-controlled learning offers. E-learning interested them as a novel educational method. They felt quite comfortable listening to the material despite the interdisciplinary nature of the lectures, which included molecular biological, pharmacological and medical aspects of cancer biology and pharmacology. This lecture was the first e-learning experience for the majority of students, and their impressions were generally positive. The students not only indicated that they would like to continue with e-learning, but also would recommend e-learning to other students. Remarkably, the majority of students would like to see more e-learning offered in their present curricula. They indicated interest in mixed forms of traditional learning and e-learning ("blended learning"), although it is recognized that face-to-face contact between teachers and students is critical. Overall, many students would consider e-learning for further and continuing education after graduation.

AB  - Logic models are based on linear relationships between program resources, activities, and outcomes, and have been used widely to support both program development and evaluation. While useful in describing some programs, the linear nature of the logic model makes it difficult to capture the complex relationships within larger, multifaceted programs. Causal loop diagrams based on a systems thinking approach can better capture a multidimensional, layered program model while providing a more complete understanding of the relationship between program elements, which enables evaluators to examine influences and dependencies between and within program components. Few studies describe how to conceptualize and apply systems models for educational program evaluation. The goal of this paper is to use our NSF-funded, Interdisciplinary GK-12 project: Bringing Authentic Problem Solving in STEM to Rural Middle Schools to illustrate a systems thinking approach to model a complex educational program to aid in evaluation. GK-12 pairs eight teachers with eight STEM doctoral fellows per program year to implement curricula in middle schools. We demonstrate how systems thinking provides added value by modeling the participant groups, instruments, outcomes, and other factors in ways that enhance the interpretation of quantitative and qualitative data. Limitations of the model include added complexity. Implications include better understanding of interactions and outcomes and analyses reflecting interacting or conflicting variables.

AB  - The study of astronomy, as an important part of any science education programme, provides our students with insights into more than just the cosmos. It may also serve as a mechanism to link them to other natural and social sciences. This article examines equally valid interpretations of the constellation Canes Venatici as an example of how the study of astronomy may serve this multidisciplinary educational role. In addition, it is an extension of the thoughts of Stannard (2001) on communicating physics through story. (Contains 4 figures and 13 footnotes.)

AB  - Purpose: The authors describe the challenges and opportunities associated with developing an interdisciplinary sustainability programme in an emerging economy and illustrate how these are addressed through the approach taken for the development of the first postgraduate programme (MSc and PhD) in sustainability science at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The purpose of this paper is to outline an approach that has a potential for application in other parts of Latin America and perhaps more broadly in other world regions sharing some of the same challenges and opportunities as found in Mexico. Design/Methodology/Approach: The implemented collaborative framework enabled a transformation of disciplinary research and teaching at UNAM into a postgraduate programme designed to generate cutting-edge educational and research capabilities. The approach to curriculum and programme design emphasized the process and methodological framework for curriculum development as much as the outcome itself. It entailed three primary elements: theory on collaborative processes; the curriculum design approach; and a formative and summative evaluation. Findings: Several of the challenges faced were related to the nature of the institution (mainly because of the complexity of its organization and the emphasis in maintaining disciplinary boundaries), as well as to the curriculum development and design approach (acceptance of a competency-based programme appropriate for the MSc but considered restrictive for the PhD). The experience the authors relate in this paper exemplifies how to cope with such challenges. The approach enabled the emergence of a shared vision that was appropriated by all the participants. This ultimately empowered them in the presentation of the curriculum to their disciplinary peers. Furthermore, the approach facilitated the creation of a programme that remained salient along the process, while increasingly gained legitimacy and credibility among the academic community. Social Implications: In Mexico, the number of sustainability practitioners and scientists is still insufficient, and there is a clear lack of capacities in key themes and tools. UNAM combines a strong scientific tradition and a foundational mandate to serve both the country and humanity and is, thus, a natural platform for developing a higher education programme in sustainability science. The approach taken in the development of UNAM's programme has useful lessons for the development of similar programmes in other developing nations facing similar educational and institutional challenges. Originality/Value: This model not only resulted in an innovative and novel programme in sustainability education but also, in the process, strengthened the competencies of diverse stakeholders through a systematic collaborative framework that fosters sustainability as a social learning process. Such experience illustrates the advantages of implementing a collaborative approach to enable the emergence of a critical mass capable to handle the diversity presupposed by a curriculum in sustainability science. It also shows how such a collaborative process can be implemented to overcome the limited resources, lack of experience in sustainability education and strong disciplinary focus that hampers the advancement of higher education in institutions similar to UNAM.

AB  - The current emphasis in K-12 education on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) (Douglas, Iversen, & Kalyandurg, 2004; Sanders, 2009) creates many ways to partner engineering education with these fields. Therefore, it is appropriate to examine the commonalities these fields have with engineering education. Though much of the science education and mathematics education history is understood, technology education's history is not common knowledge, and as a result misconceptions abound (Daugherty & Wicklein, 1993 Wicklein, 2008). Technology education's longstanding history in problem- and project-based learning, design- and engineering-related pedagogical approach is over a century old and grounded in theories of Comenius, Rousseau, Pestalozzi, Froebel, Herbart, Sheldon, and Dewey (Dewey, 1915; Foster, 1995, 1997; Herschbach, 2009; Kirkwood, 1994). The brief review of technology education's history will reveal an almost eerie parallel to the current engineering education and STEM education movements. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Schools, as institutions for general education, are believed to have a responsibility to equip their students with the knowledge and commitment to take personally meaningful decisions and action to address the challenges posed by both lifestyle and societal conditions. Achieving this goal requires, among other things, adequate integration of the "challenges" into the school curricula. This paper reports results of a study that assessed whether (and the extent to which) loss of biological diversity and climate change have been incorporated into Biology curriculum guides for Ethiopian secondary and preparatory schools. To this end, content analysis has been used as a principal technique. The findings revealed that the revised curriculum guides have integrated a number of issues that could enhance understanding about the significance of biodiversity and consequences of its loss. Issues related to biodiversity have been addressed, in one form or the other, in all grades except grade eleven. When it comes to climate change, the revised curriculum guides offer little opportunity to integrate the issue. The paper thus argues that, where such issues are not "manifestly" integrated into the curriculum guides, one cannot expect concrete action planned and executed against loss of biodiversity and climate change. The paper calls for redressing some of the observed limitations through interdisciplinary collaboration and/or revision of existing content. (Contains 3 figures and 8 tables.)

AB  - This research aimed to investigate the requirements of the application of the STEM approach in teaching science and mathematics and the teachers' attitudes towards it. The study used descriptive approach. The study sample consisted of (159) male and female teachers chosen by the random stratified sample method from the study community represented by all science, mathematics and computer teachers in Ajloun Governorate in the academic year 2019/2020. The scale of requirements for applying the STEM approach and teachers' attitudes towards it was developed; the validity and reliability of the study instrument were verified by appropriate statistical methods. Statistical processing was done using arithmetic means, and the analysis of multiple variance analysis. The results showed that the teachers 'assessments of the requirements of the STEM approach are all high and above the hypothetical average (75%). "Changing the teaching methods" dimension came in the first place with an arithmetic mean (30, 29), followed by the dimension of "changing the learning goals" with an arithmetic mean (30.15). The third place was for "changing the vision and skills of teachers" dimension with an arithmetic mean (30.13), and the last place was for the domain of "changing the classroom environment" with an arithmetic mean (22.37). It showed that teachers' attitudes toward STEM teaching are positive and high. And there were no statistically significant differences at the level (0.05) in the male and female teachers' assessments of the requirements of STEM application and their attitudes towards it. On the other hand, there are statistically significant differences in their estimates according to the phase variable and in favor of the elementary stage. There were statistically significant differences according to the variable of specialization and for the benefit of science and mathematics teachers compared to Computer ones. And in light of the results, the study presented a set of recommendations.

AB  - For many, the dominant model of curriculum development in science includes generating a topic, clarifying science content, identifying activities associated with the topic, and figuring out an assessment. Unfortunately, this approach tends to overemphasize activities and underemphasize mastery of science concepts and the process of scientific inquiry. The National Standards for Science Education should stand as the learning outcomes for any science curriculum. However, educators also need to focus on how students learn; on integrating laboratory experiences with other activities in the classroom; and on ensuring rigorous, focused, and coherent content in the context of a curriculum that focuses on the process of scientific inquiry and the acquisition of conceptual knowledge. The Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS), with funding from the National Science Foundation, offers an effective alternative to the traditional high school sequence of biology, chemistry, and physics. Each year begins with a two-week Science as Inquiry unit, followed by three core units that last eight weeks each in physical science, life science, and earth-space science. The last unit of the year is multidisciplinary and examines compelling issues in science and society. Students who used the program showed average gains in science understanding of 20-25 percent.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance, genetically modified produce, avian flu, and invasive species persistence are just a few scientific issues pulled from the headlines that affect society on a daily basis. Understanding these issues requires knowledge of evolutionary processes. Educating students about evolution may never have been as necessary as it is today; however, public battles between science and religion provide hurdles to teaching evolution. The need to produce students equipped to understand current and future scientific issues of societal relevance is rarely disputed. Therefore, it is important to find creative ways to accomplish this goal. Improving a student's ability to understand evolution may be achieved through an inquiry-based module that focuses on relevant and uncontroversial geological, physical, and life sciences. This article describes a module which engages students in determining the age of their fossil, its relationship to living organisms, and observing natural selection through inquiry-based and collaborative learning. By first understanding the scientific methods used by paleontologists to document evolutionary processes, later lessons specific to evolution are effective and well-received. The module described in this article consists of three lessons that address "National Science Education Standards" and have the potential to improve science process skills through interdisciplinary content. All lessons utilize group collaborations and provide inquiry-based activities that model the science done by university professors and scientists. Additionally, each lesson focuses on understanding uncontroversial scientific material including the law of superposition (i.e., the idea that younger sediments are laid down on top of older sediments), relative vs. absolute dating (i.e., methods for determining the age of fossils and surrounding rocks), classification methods, and the process of natural selection.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: Research shows that students encounter difficulties in identifying the structure of argumentation texts and in understanding the main message of the argument. The research examined the effect that learning Logic Programming (LP), while applying logic inference, has on students' understanding of argumentation texts. Background: Understanding an argumentation text means exposure to its structure, which requires the ability to identify the argument presented and to distinguish between the argument and its justifications. Argumentation is an important cognitive capacity for handling conflicting information, viewpoints, and opinions. Students' lack of ability to identify the structure of argumentation texts, and to understand its' main message, affects the understanding of texts in general, the writing of texts, and the presentation of oral arguments. Since Logic Programming is based on inference that is similar to the way in which people commonly believe that human inferential thinking is performed, our research approach was to investigate how learning LP in Computer Science affects the understanding of argumentation texts in Linguistics. Methodology: The research population included 319 11th-grade students from five high schools, divided into a study group and a control group. Students' understanding was tested using knowledge questionnaires after completing their language studies, before (pre-study) and after (post-study) a year of learning LP. The knowledge questionnaires included argumentation paragraphs where students were asked to give each paragraph a title and to analyze the argument structure. In addition, an attitudes questionnaire was administered at the end of the school year in order to examine the students' attitudes towards the connection between the two disciplines. The research applied a mixed method approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative methods. Contribution: The research and its' findings contribute to the previous body of knowledge with relation to students difficulties in understanding argumentation texts in Linguistics studies. Moreover, it suggests a new approach of using argumentation in the framework of inference as apply in LP to scaffold students' conceptions. The use of an interactive computerized system (like the logic programming language Prolog) can scaffold students in constructing their knowledge, develop their computational thinking skills, and also enables to vary the teaching methods. Findings: Findings show that the students' understanding of argumentation texts improved after learning LP. The study group students' achievements were explicitly better compared with the control group students, who did not learn LP, though this was not always reflected with significant statistics. Students' attitudes questionnaire revealed that students did not identify on their own the connections between the two disciplines and so could not explicitly use it to promote their understanding. Recommendations for Practitioners: Creative educators, who value challenges, can greatly benefit their students if they collaborate in aim for applying interdisciplinary learning while combining those two disciplines. The research conclusions shows that it is possible to improve students' understanding if teachers explicitly mediate and guide students in drawing analogies. Recommendations for Researchers: The analysis tool we developed and apply can be used by educators and researchers to evaluate the understanding of argumentative texts by learners. It can be used in language classes at all levels as well as by educators in other disciplines in which the understanding of the argumentative structure is fundamental. Impact on Society: Developing argumentation skills and computational thinking skills. Future Research: Vary future possible research can follow the presented approach: examining how LP teachers expose the logical structure of an argumentation paragraph when they write logic programs that describe the inference represented in texts; examining how language teachers coupe with learning and using LP; examines the knowledge and skills of students that experienced a mediate learning process in the two disciplines in parallel.

In order to assist a group of teachers (who began teaching the "Science for All" program) in both teaching and assessment strategies, it was decided that the Department of Science Teaching at the Weizmann Institute of Science would sponsor a workshop for them. An evaluation study was conducted during the workshop and at its completion. The main goal of the study was to evaluate the outcomes of the workshop and to determine whether its objectives were attained. The research tools consisted of (a) an attitude questionnaire administered to participating teachers, (b) structured interviews with the teachers, (c) structured interviews with students, and (d) an attitude questionnaire  administered to the students. Based on the results of the questionnaires and the interviews, it seems that all the teachers who participated in the workshop gained self-confidence in using the teaching strategies and assessment methods of this new interdisciplinary curriculum. The interviews with students revealed that their active involvement in their own assessment improved their sense of responsibility for their achievements. The variety of assignments enabled them to be at their best with certain assignments and to succeed less with others. In conclusion, we found that running a new interdisciplinary curriculum requires a professional development program that will stimulate teachers' creativity and diversify the instructional strategies that they use in the classroom. Such skills should improve their ability to understand the goals, strategies, and rationale of the curriculum, as well as their students' learning difficulties.

AB  - With the support of the East Tennessee State University (ETSU) administration and a grant from Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the departments of Biological Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics, and Curriculum and Instruction have developed a biology-math integrated curriculum. An interdisciplinary faculty team, charged with teaching the 18 curriculum modules, designed this three-semester curriculum, known as SYMBIOSIS. This curriculum was piloted to two student cohorts during the developmental stage. The positive feedback and assessment results of this project have given us the foundation to implement the SYMBIOSIS curriculum as a replacement for the standard biology majors curriculum at the introductory level. This article addresses the history and development of the curriculum, previous assessment results and current assessment protocol, and the future of ETSU's approach to implementing the SYMBIOSIS curriculum.

AB  - An important objective of science and technology education is the development of pupils' capacity for systems thinking. While in science education the term system relates mainly to structures and phenomena in the natural world, technology education focuses on systems designed to fulfill people's needs and desires: examples include systems to control the local environment, or the position or motion of objects. Despite the centrality of the system concept to technology and technology education, issues relating to the teaching and learning of systems within the technology curriculum have been little addressed. This paper explores some elemental structures common to technological feedback control systems, and highlights the relationships between the structural nature and the dynamic behavior of these systems. It is argued that the study of systems and control concepts in technology has the potential to promote higher learning skills such as interdisciplinary thinking and modeling, and an instructional framework for achieving this goal is proposed. Questions and research issues on the fostering of systems thinking in technology education are identified.

AB  - Current approaches to science-technology-society (STS) education focus primarily on the controversial socio-scientific issues that arise from the application of science in modern technology. This paper argues for an interdisciplinary approach to STS education that embraces science, technology, history, and social and cultural studies. By employing a case study of traditional papermaking technology, it investigates how the interactions between technology and science can be explored in an authentic societal and cultural context across a historical time span. The term technology-society-science (TSS) is used to represent an alternative approach to linking technology, society, and science that aims to redress the imbalance between science and technology, and to resolve the tension between two diverging goals of STS education. The educational implications of this alternative approach to STS education are discussed. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Increased attention to student engagement and active learning strategies have become particularly relevant in today's classroom environments. These approaches are also considered to be meaningful when teaching "net generation" students who have different styles and expectations. This study attempts to address these challenges through the development of an interdisciplinary, active learning experience that increases information technology literacy of business students through the use of Web 2.0 tools. The research questions under consideration are: Can information technology literacy skills be effectively developed in an interdisciplinary setting? How does the development of an experiential learning activity enhance student engagement and learning outcomes? A discussion of the active learning literature and the appropriateness of such strategies with net generation learners is provided. The study also details the implementation of this experience within the curriculum, and assesses the benefits and challenges related to enhanced student learning and engagement as well as literacy outcomes. Increased student engagement was noted in both instructor and student evaluations of the assignment. Furthermore, assignment design features such as opportunities for exploration, analysis and feedback contributed to the level of connectivity. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - A low-cost and portable colorimeter kit has been designed and developed as an educational tool at Penn State University by Dr. Daniel Sykes for K-12 schools' integrated STEM learning. This scientific instrument allows students to learn how scientists utilize light as a means to study the chemical and physical properties of materials with an accuracy of instruments such as the Ocean Optics USB 4000 Spectrophotometer costing nearly $2000. In addition, it serves as a platform to introduce the topics of wet chemistry, nanotechnology, electronics, computer Excel graphing, and algebra in the classroom. Teachers at the Park Forest Middle School (PA) had previously developed an interdisciplinary Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) team. The cross-curricular nature of the group strives to reinforce each teacher's subject areas by developing curricula and projects that connect individual subjects into a bigger, real-world picture. During the summer of 2011, two of the Park Forest Middle School STEM team members were privileged to study with Dr. Daniel Sykes, Senior Lecturer, Director of Analytical Instructional Laboratories, Department of Chemistry and Forensic Sciences Program in the University's Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program. The RET program, mentored by Dr. Francelys Medina, MRSEC Education and Outreach Coordinator, immerses K-12 teachers in hands-on research with leading scientists. During the six weeks that followed, additional members of the Park Forest Middle School STEM team staff became actively involved in developing and participating in a cutting-edge STEM endeavor centered on Dr. Sykes' colorimeter. Working in teams, technology education students assembled the colorimeters and learned how the electronic components interact to quantify electromagnetic radiation in the visible light spectrum. When completed, students utilized the instruments in science classes to test properties of various solutions with a spotlight on nanoscale particles. The data collected was entered into Excel spreadsheets for graphing/analysis in their algebra class.

AB  - This article draws on Gee's notions of Discourse and specifically Discourse Models to explore Engineering Problem Solving1 and the different ways in which it can be understood in an engineering context. After Gee we attempt to identify aspects of doing, being and valuing that underpin people's Problem Solving Discourse Models. Interviews with three engineering lecturers reveal that they draw extensively on two different Discourse Models of Engineering Problem Solving. The more highly valued Model (Integrated Design Model) reflects engineering practice, is located in engineering design and dependant on judgement. The other is located in the classroom and involves the algorithmic resolution of mathematical models, (Knowledge Construction Model). These Discourse Models form a backdrop to interviews with three students entering an engineering degree programme for the first time. The three students each draw different Discourse Models of Problem Solving, and display characteristics (such as the level of confidence) that align more or less with Engineering Problem Solving, sometimes obscuring their understanding. The implications of these findings in terms of an introductory engineering course are discussed. These include recognising the potential diversity of Problem Solving Discourse Models our students bring to tertiary education, as well as the difficulty of introducing a legitimate design project requiring the level of judgement needed to interpret open-ended, ill-defined problems and then integrate multiple quantitative models with multidisciplinary qualitative judgements in a rigorous manner.

AB  - Incorporation of mathematics into biology curricula is critical to underscore for undergraduate students the relevance of mathematics to most fields of biology and the usefulness of developing quantitative process skills demanded in modern biology. At our institution, we have made significant changes to better integrate mathematics into the undergraduate biology curriculum. The curricular revision included changes in the suggested course sequence, addition of statistics and precalculus as prerequisites to core science courses, and incorporating interdisciplinary (math-biology) learning activities in genetics and zoology courses. In this article, we describe the activities developed for these two courses and the assessment tools used to measure the learning that took place with respect to biology and statistics. We distinguished the effectiveness of these learning opportunities in helping students improve their understanding of the math and statistical concepts addressed and, more importantly, their ability to apply them to solve a biological problem. We also identified areas that need emphasis in both biology and mathematics courses. In light of our observations, we recommend best practices that biology and mathematics academic departments can implement to train undergraduates for the demands of modern biology.

AB  - The relation between information science and library science has been debated for decades, and even attempts at utilizing methods generally acknowledged as robust for the purpose of mapping research fields have yielded results with large variations. Therefore, a set of citation analyses was performed, comparing the results of analyses on information science and library science separately but also as a joint library and information science (LIS) field. Although there are large differences, not the least in the author-level analyses, the patterns in the citation data support the concept of a joint LIS field with information science and library science being the two main subfields; many of the variations in the analyses are caused by the interdisciplinary nature of LIS, reflected in, for example, variations in citation practices in the different subfields.

They were told they had one month to investigate and present their results, and asked, "What do you need to begin?" This hook served to introduce the next project in the author's 100% project-based curriculum. It addresses both the New York State Learning Standards and the National Science Education Standards. This article describes the project in more detail and what students learned along the way. (Contains 1 figure and 7 online resources.)

AB  - CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) has been one of the major innovations that has been implemented in Spain in the last decades and many questions have arisen in relation to its effectiveness. The aim of this article is to report primary teachers' perceptions of the most relevant aspects of CLIL teaching of Science and Social Science in Primary Education in the Region of Murcia. Their perceptions of this integrated approach are crucial to meet their needs, coordinate their efforts and develop good practice. Results from this research emphasize an extensive application of CLIL methodological guidelines and the use of a wide range of tools when evaluating learners' competences. Additionally, they have expressed their satisfaction with language assistants when motivating pupils and fostering their oral skills and intercultural awareness. However, CLIL teachers believe Public Administration should provide more resources, further training and enhanced coordination to improve the quality of education under this paradigm.

AB  - This paper proposes social living labs for informed learning as an innovative approach to interprofessional and community education. It presents a new conceptual model and practice framework suited to rapidly changing, information-intensive work and social environments. The proposed approach is theoretically informed and evidence based. It integrates concepts from three complementary fields: Informed learning as information literacy pedagogy that enables using information critically and creatively to learn (information science); interprofessional education as a professional learning model with a cross-disciplinary and community reach (health sciences/medicine); and social living labs as informal learning context and problem-solving process (community development). After reviewing relevant literature, the paper introduces the concepts and research that underpin social living labs for informed learning. Then it presents a new conceptual model and a practice framework to guide their design and implementation. To illustrate the practical application of this approach, a hypothetical scenario envisages health practitioners, librarians and community members collaborating in a social living lab to address health and social challenges related to child obesity. The paper concludes by discussing anticipated benefits and limitations of the approach and possible wider application. As a contribution to theory, the paper uncovers a previously unrecognised synergy between the principles of informed learning, social living labs and interprofessional education. Supporting information literacy research and practice, the paper identifies a significant role for informed learning in community and professional education, and a novel strategy for health information literacy development. The paper is of interest to educators, researchers, and practitioners across information literacy, community development, healthcare, and other professional fields.

AB  - The focus of the paper is on the transformative effect on student learning and engagement that results from using contemporary Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools and directed reflection to engage in spatial learning about the politics (literally) surrounding the student. I report on the pedagogical advantages of using spatial analysis (especially embedded in GIS maps) and reflection to foster student engagement with, and learning of, the multidisciplinary foundations of local political conflicts. I present a community politics course that employs GIS (emphasizing goals and learning methods), discuss new developments in GIS tools that enable projects such as the one evaluated here, describe the neighborhood analysis project used in the course and present a detailed, multi-semester assessment of student projects that employs both qualitative data based on student reflections and a more quantitative review of their work. This paper provides a discussion and assessment of applying (GIS) technology to student self-awareness of, and engagement with, political issues in their own hometown. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Literacy standards (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices & Council of Chief State School Officers in Common core state standards: English language arts standards, 2010) and best practices from Institute of Education Sciences practice guides (e.g., Baker et al. in Teaching academic content and literacy to English learners in elementary and middle school (NCEE 2014-4012), National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance, 2014; Kamil et al. in Improving adolescent literacy: effective classroom and intervention practices (NCEE 2008-4027), National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance, 2008) encourage content-area teachers to use text reading to improve vocabulary and comprehension for middle grade students. Despite these strong research recommendations and various literacy initiatives, previous research studies have found a persistent pattern of limited text use (i.e., reading and learning from text) in content-area classrooms, thus limiting students' opportunities to develop advanced literacy skills. This study extends the research base on text use in middle school by presenting findings of a questionnaire administered to 124 middle school teachers and offering insights on how text is typically used in English language arts, science, and social studies classes. Teachers responded to questions about the duration and frequency of text use, as well as reading formats, reading materials (including textbooks), and challenges to utilizing text reading more often. Findings suggest that while most teachers indicated a desire to increase the amount of reading in their classes, they cited challenges such as students' difficulty with reading and a preference for using other types of teaching activities. Teachers also cited the need for higher-quality texts, and science and social studies teachers, in particular, reported dissatisfaction with and limited use of textbooks. Implications for practice include providing professional development focused on selecting appropriate texts for instruction, using text reading routines that enhance purposeful learning, and integrating reading practices into existing instructional delivery practices.

AB  - The success of interdisciplinary research teams depends largely upon skills related to team performance. We evaluated student and team performance for undergraduate biology and mathematics students who participated in summer research projects conducted in off-campus laboratories. The student teams were composed of a student with a mathematics background and an experimentally oriented biology student. The team mentors typically ranked the students' performance very good to excellent over a range of attributes that included creativity and ability to conduct independent research. However, the research teams experienced problems meeting prespecified deadlines due to poor time and project management skills. Because time and project management skills can be readily taught and moreover typically reflect good research practices, simple modifications should be made to undergraduate curricula so that the promise of initiatives, such as MATH-BIO 2010, can be implemented.

AB  - GeoJourney is an interdisciplinary field trip in geology, Native American studies, and environmental studies designed for introductory-level undergraduates. The program travels 23,345 kilometers by van to national parks, industrial sites, museums, and Indian reservations in 24 of the United States. During the day, students carry out hands-on projects, field investigations, and hikes. At night, campfire lectures and discussions, along with reading assignments and written exams, enhance the educational experience. Assessment of student conceptual change in the geosciences shows statistically significant improvement beyond that seen in the traditional geoscience classroom setting.

AB  - Researchers can be reluctant to work with fellow academics outside their disciplines or to engage the public in their research. Some will even hesitate to work with departmental colleagues or their own students if they perceive a disciplinary gap. Many of today's pressing social concerns, however, demand interdisciplinary solutions and benefit from the involvement of diverse stakeholders. In "Why and How to Be Interdisciplinary," published in the May-June 2006 issue of "Academe", Anne Dalke, Paul Grobstein, and Elizabeth McCormack wrote about the engagement of faculty members in interdisciplinary ventures. In this article, the author encourages consideration of the next step: facilitating interaction between academics and the public. Her current position as a professor of environmental education explicitly draws this connection, and she has had many discussions with colleagues about how scientists might communicate about their work outside exclusively professional channels. She hopes academics could welcome within the faculty truly interdisciplinary individuals and those interested in issues involving education and the public.

AB  - The paper investigates how planetary science could be integrated into other courses, specifically geography and astronomy, at two universities in Hungary and the UK. We carried out both a classroom course and an online course over several years. The methods used and the experiences gained, including feedback from students and useful examples for other educators, are summarized. We found that it is possible to integrate planetary science into geography-related subjects and that planetary science can be used to encourage the students to uncover gaps in their knowledge and also to help to synthesize information they have learnt from different disciplines.

AB  - The integration of science and agriculture has been discussed since the inception of agricultural education. However, the standards-based focus in public secondary education and changing climate of agriculture has brought science integration back to the forefront. Though research has indicated that the integration of science into agricultural education is effective in improving student achievement in science, there are still challenges. The instrumental case study sought to understand how Mr. Lee effectively integrated science into a traditional program while maintaining the benefits and purpose of agricultural education. Six issues, deduced from literature related to the integration of science in agricultural education, were identified. Six themes emerged that elucidate the process of successful science integration. First, agricultural educators' science content knowledge must be strengthened. Second, the pedagogy of scientific inquiry lacked components necessary for a rigorous curriculum. Third, agricultural educators who desire to integrate science should dig into their curriculum for existing science content. Fourth, collaboration among agriculture and science teachers can be fostered through involvement in the science department, and fifth the agricultural educator plays a fundamental role in curriculum planning to increase secondary science achievement. Finally, actual integration occurred in a more segmented way than proposed by Robert's and Ball's (2009) content and context dual-model.

AB  - The notion of risk in relation to food and food production has heightened the need to educate students to effectively deal with risk in relation to decision making from a science-based perspective. Curricula and related materials were developed and adopted to support graduate learning opportunities in risk analysis and decision making as applied in agriculture, veterinary medicine, and the life sciences. Student and instructor interviews, course evaluations, and expert reviews of course syllabi and the program description were used to determine the value of formalizing this interdisciplinary graduate minor/certificate program. The quality of the three graduate level core courses developed and delivered exhibited the merit of the program but a major challenge remains with regard to long-term sustainability of this specialized training.

AB  - Two linked courses examining conservation science and art history of 17th-century Dutch painting are described. The two courses have been taught on campus and, most recently, as study-abroad courses in collaboration with the Center for European Studies, Universiteit Maastricht, The Netherlands. The highly interdisciplinary courses are intense, yet presuppose that students have no background in either science or art history. The courses have successfully drawn students who are science majors as well as nonmajors into the same classroom with productive outcomes. Strengths and limitations of the approaches taken are discussed and key resources from the courses are cited. (Contains 6 figures.)

AB  - Background: Educational neuroscience is a relatively new discipline. However, many obstacles persist in delaying the success of an interface between neuroscience and education. One such major obstacle has been the spread of neuromyths. Purpose: The main aim of this study was to verify whether Portuguese teachers are susceptible to misinterpreting neuroscientific findings and believe in neuromyths that might ultimately impair their teaching--or simply waste time investing in techniques that will not aid their students. Sample: A sample of 583 Portuguese teachers from different areas of expertise participated in this study. The participants were aged between 25 and 61 years (mean = 41; SD = 9) and taught at Preschool to High School levels. Design and methods: We designed a questionnaire to assess whether teachers believed in the neuromyths. Non-myth/myth statements were presented, alongside an open-ended question concerning the links between brain and education. Together, these queries afforded a database of the teachers' knowledge concerning neuroscientific facts and neuromyths. Results: Our results suggest that teachers fail to distinguish myths from facts, irrespective of the area taught and level of teaching. However, our findings also indicate that, although teachers have difficulties in untangling myths from facts, Portuguese teachers are interested in the workings of the brain and recognise the potential of neuroscientific information in education. Conclusions: Results from this study suggest that communication between neuroscientists and teachers must be improved through an open, interdisciplinary dialogue. This research raises questions that should help to develop educational neuroscience as a discipline. Namely, we highlight the need for a translation of the educational neuroscience facts into a language shared by teachers; and the need for specific training so that teachers might make adequate use of education-related neuroscientific findings in the classroom.

AB  - The integrative approach of teaching Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) has been advocated as a pedagogical means to advance education for the 21st century. However, there is a lack of validated instruments that are theoretically grounded to account for the various forms of knowledge that teachers need in order to effectively implement STEM education. This study adopts the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework to develop the Technological Pedagogical STEM Knowledge Survey to assess teachers' self-efficacies of the proposed dimensions of knowledge. It also investigates the interrelationships of the four knowledge dimensions (i.e., technological pedagogical science knowledge [TPSK], technological pedagogical mathematics knowledge [TPMK], technological pedagogical engineering knowledge [TPEK] and integrative STEM) proposed in this paper. A total of 314 science, mathematics and technology teachers from China responded to the online survey. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated adequate validity and reliability of the survey for measuring teachers' self-efficacies for STEM from the TPACK perspective. The structural equational model indicates that the teachers' efficacies of integrating technology into science, mathematics and engineering subject predict their efficacy of integrative STEM teaching. Moreover, teachers' TPEK is the strongest predictor of their efficacy for teaching integrative STEM. Overall, the findings support that the TPACK framework could be theoretically useful for promoting teachers' efficacies for STEM education. Practical implications were discussed in this study.

AB  - Evidence-based instructional practices (ebips) have been associated with positive student outcomes; however, institutions struggle to catalyze widespread adoption of these practices in general education science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) courses. Further, linking ebips with integrated learning assessment is rarely discussed in the literature, even though principles of continuous course design for quality higher education assume the connection of learning outcomes, teaching practices, and assessment. This qualitative action research study documents faculty attempting to utilize ebips and authentic assessment when they were provided support and accountability over multiple semesters. It documents participants' current practices and encourage shifts in both teaching and assessment practices targeting greater student success in stem general education courses. Narrative data drawn from interviews and written reflection describe the impact of structured faculty observation and cross-disciplinary conversation on participants' pedagogical and assessment choices. The faculty participants' voices vividly illustrate our findings: incentives, reflection, mentorship, and collaboration over multiple semesters support changing pedagogical practices and integrating outcomes assessment. While stem-based, the study findings are applicable across the general education curriculum.

AB  - The First Year Seminar in Science (SCIE113) was developed during 2009/2010 academic year through an exemplary collaboration between faculty, administrators and educational support staff in the Faculty of Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC). SCIE113 reflects the vision and values of the Faculty of Science and UBC by offering an enriched educational experience to its first year students. The small class format provides students an intimate connection with faculty, an opportunity for significant engagement early in their academic careers, and helps with transitioning to the university environment. The overall goal of SCIE113 is to introduce skills that cross disciplinary boundaries and that every scientist and student in science must master: how to constructively build an evidence-based argument and how to communicate effectively. The overarching course goals are to define and discuss the elements of a scientific approach, to think like a scientist, and to communicate science through writing. SCIE113 fosters the development of authentic scientific scholars through the construction, integration, and use of argumentation skills and through an exploration of science as a way of knowing using a collaborative class environment. SCIE113 engages students in interactive and collaborative activities and promotes learning of scientific argumentation and writing skills. In-class and out-of-class activities allow students to frequently discuss, debate, and defend their views of science. Specific learning activities such as case studies, targeted readings, and examinations of media and scientific articles allow students to evaluate the validity of scientific claims and to construct a scientific argument. Meanwhile, activities such as reflections, in-class writing, peer review, and discussions on the fundamentals of writing help students to improve their writing skills which are assessed by three short essays and a term project. The guided peer review process, which fosters collaboration, enables students to provide expert-like feedback to their peers. Faculty and TA feedback completes the review process. SCIE113 is an exemplary model of collaboration and is guided by best practices in instructional design. SCIE113 is a model of collaborative course design and instruction with a large, multidisciplinary teaching team. The design of SCIE113 is guided by best practices and continues to evolve in response to emerging research. The teaching team consists of faculty and teaching assistants from 14 different departments, representing four Faculties, with a wide range of expertise and experience in fostering student learning. The teaching team meets bi-weekly to cultivate reflective practice and to support faculty in their professional development for teaching this writing intensive course. SCIE113 is informed by the scholarship of teaching and learning. SCIE113 is informed by comprehensive research that is incorporated into course design and implementation and utilizes validated assessment tools. Frequent feedback from students and faculty, and measures of perceived and actual learning gains, ensure successful course implementation and promote student learning.

AB  - A pilot study provided insight into difficulties experienced by 143 Yr. 2 B.Ed. students in Scotland, writing in a science education context. In studying writing, an 'academic literacies' approach was adopted, focusing on social aspects in addition to identifying flaws. In over 20% of assignments, tutors' assessments identified a need to structure or sequence content. In 15%, a lack of explanation and expansion of ideas was noted. Detailed examination, of a 15% sample of scripts, showed approximately half with errors in punctuation, sentence structure or word use, tending to obscure the intended meaning. A questionnaire, completed by 70% of the student cohort, indicated that the assessed task had been perceived as authentic. 25% of that sample reported finding writing about science more difficult than for other subjects. It is argued that development of writing about science is important for future teachers and must become a stronger part of an overall, inter-disciplinary, course approach.

AB  - Despite their common history, there are many cultural, attitudinal and practical differences between the professions of medicine and pharmacy that ultimately influence patient care and health outcomes. While poor communication between doctors and pharmacists is a major cause of medical errors, it is clear that effective, deliberate doctor-pharmacist collaboration within certain clinical settings significantly improves patient care. This may be particularly true for those patients with chronic illnesses and/or requiring regular medication reviews. Moreover, in hospitals, clinical and antibiotic pharmacists are successfully influencing prescribing and infection control policy. Under the new Irish Pharmacy Act (2007), pharmacists are legally obliged to provide pharmaceutical care to their patients, thus fulfilling a more patient-centred role than their traditional "dispensing" one. However, meeting this obligation relies on the existence of good doctor-pharmacist working relationships, such that inter-disciplinary teamwork in monitoring patients becomes the norm in all healthcare settings. As discussed here, efforts to improve these relationships must focus on the strategic introduction of agreed changes in working practices between the two professions and on educational aspects of pharmaceutical care. For example, standardized education of doctors/medical students such that they learn to prescribe in an optimal manner and ongoing inter-professional education of doctors and pharmacists in therapeutics, are likely to be of paramount importance. Here, insights into the types of factors that help or hinder the improvement of these working relationships and the importance of education and agreed working practices in defining the separate but inter-dependent professions of pharmacy and medicine are reviewed and discussed.

AB  - Background: To inform STEM education for benefiting emerging bilingual (EB) and English fluent (EF) students, the present study evaluated the order effects of integrating science and arts within a large-scale, ongoing effort investigating the efficacies of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)-aligned Science Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) methodologies to provide more equitable opportunities to students to learn science through Arts integration (STEAM). The experiment examines the curriculum integrating order of implementing combinations of STEM and STEAM approaches in fifth grade life and physical science instruction, comparing (STEM [right arrow] STEAM) vs (STEAM [right arrow] STEM). Results: T tests and a three-way between-groups analysis of covariance examined the impact of instructional order, language fluency, and teachers' implementation fidelity. Findings indicate similar results in life and physical sciences, in which the STEAM first approach produced significantly higher science learning gains for both EF and EB students, revealing some higher learning gains for EF students, but with greater STEAM first order effect advantages for EB students overall. While EF students show higher learning gain scores in the high fidelity classrooms, the advantage of the STEAM first order is greater for EB students in all classroom fidelity levels and even within low to moderate implementation fidelity classrooms, as may commonly occur, such that the integration order of STEAM before STEM strategy is particularly advantageous to EB learners. Conclusions: The integration pattern of leading with STEAM and following with STEM offers an important opportunity to learn for EB students, and increases equity in opportunities to learn among EB and EF learners of science. Both EB and EF students benefit similarly and significantly in high fidelity implementation classrooms. However, the gains for EF students are not significant in low fidelity implementation classrooms, while in such low fidelity implementation classrooms, the EB students still benefited significantly despite the poor implementation. These results suggest that a strong compensating STEAM first order effect advantage is possibly involved in the implementation system for the EB population of learners. Teaching science through the arts with STEAM lessons is an effective approach that can be significantly improved through introducing STEM units with the STEAM first order effect advantage.

AB  - The geology program at Clemson University has instituted a new, six-semester-long undergraduate research course sequence that requires student participation in ongoing departmental research projects from their sophomore through senior years. As a part of a university-wide initiative focusing on undergraduate research, termed Creative Inquiry at Clemson University, the experience provides students with the opportunity to address real research problems in Earth science, gather their own data, and interact with a diverse group of students through interdisciplinary group projects that culminate in group presentations and the publication of research results. Students may choose from a variety of research project options, most of which involve environmental monitoring of selected parcels of an extensive tract of university-owned forest land near campus. Assessment of the pilot offering of the sophomore research experience indicated that students recognized the effectiveness of these courses in fostering better inquiry, analysis, and presentation skills.

AB  - This paper presents findings from a two-year qualitative study examining integration of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) into elementary mathematics instruction. Integrated units were developed by elementary teachers and CS/CT coaches with support from university faculty with expertise in CS/CT and elementary mathematics. CS/CT instruction primarily relied on the Scratch environment, although some lessons made use of Code.org materials. This research primarily relied on two theories of integration (i.e. Kiray, 2012. A new model for the integration of science and mathematics: The balance model. "Energy Education Science and Technology Part B: Social and Educational Studies," 4(3), 1181-1196) that provided insight into the level of interconnection between the disciplines and the relative amount of instructional time spent within each discipline. Findings revealed that cross-grade CS/CT concepts included sequencing, looping, and conditional logic. Within each category: (a) concepts were taught with increasing complexity across the grades, (b) the mathematics was dominant and CS/CT was important but secondary, and (c) three types of lessons emerged: No integration, partial integration, and full integration. Lastly, lessons generally included a transition from less integrated to more integrated activities with an initial focus on discipline-specific conceptual understanding prior to integrated activities.

AB  - A three-course sequence for first-year students that integrates beginning concepts in biology and chemistry has been designed. The first two courses that emphasize chemistry and its capacity to inform biological applications are described here. The content of the first course moves from small to large particles with an emphasis on membrane macrostructures and protein structure. Critical to this progression is an understanding of strong and weak bonding interactions within and between macrostructure subunits. The Boltzmann distribution and Boltzmann entropy are used in the second course to rationalize enthalpy and entropy changes in biochemical reactions and consequences of the second law of thermodynamics. Biochemical processes in the second course include protein folding, hydration, ligand binding to proteins, ATP hydrolysis, protein redox reactions, and enzyme kinetics. Attitude assessment indicated students were overwhelmingly satisfied with the course sequence. Students had a broader view of interdisciplinary science after finishing the sequence compared to their counterparts in the traditional chemistry or biology sequence. For schools that do not have a three-term schedule, integrated biological examples are provided to help strengthen ties between chemistry and biology disciplines. (Contains 2 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - This paper presents the concept and results of the research project "Engineer Your Sound!" (2008-2009). It aimed at exploring whether interdisciplinary, innovative teaching/learning settings in the fields of technology and digital media can be used to give pupils the opportunities to experiment and discover their technical potential, skills, interests and talents and if music technology could offer such an appealing context. The paper explains how technology and why gender need to be addressed when planning to raise young people's interest in technology but questions if interest in technology is mainly influenced by gender. The paper explores through ethnographic research how pupils' technological competencies and interests have developed during the course of a technology-related project. Results of the analysis explain how music technology can serve as a suitable theme with the potential to increase both males' and females' interest in technology.

AB  - An element of current reform in science education worldwide is the shift from the dominant traditional algorithmic lower-order cognitive skills (LOCS) teaching, to the higher-order cognitive skills (HOCS)-promoting learning; that is, the development of students' capabilities including those of question asking (QA), critical/system thinking (CST), decision making (DM), problem solving (PS), conceptualisation of fundamental concepts (CFC) and the transfer of these within both the science disciplines and real life interdisciplinary situations. Accordingly, an innovative metacognition-promoting science teacher professional development course, integrating formal and informal science education, was developed and implemented within a traditional model, focusing on the HOCS skills of QA, PS, and CFC. The HOCS promoting teaching and assessment strategies of this course not only enabled participants to reflect on their own learning, but also facilitated their self-reflective assessment, utilising a pre-post designed research-based methodology. The results suggest that such, or similarly appropriate, metacognition-oriented courses can contribute positively to the development of science teachers' HOCS capability.

AB  - We conducted research within a program serving future mathematics and science teachers. Groups of teachers worked primarily online in an asynchronous discussion environment on a 6-week task in which they applied learning-science ideas acquired from an educational psychology course to design interdisciplinary instructional units. We employed an adapted coding system to determine that group leadership was highly distributed among participants. We illustrated that leadership emerged through different forms of participation described in this paper and that, in some cases, individuals specialized in specific leadership roles within groups. Findings helped validate the theoretical concept of group cognition and led us to suggest an approach to online asynchronous learning for college students that depends more on students' emergent leadership skills than on prescriptive assignment or scripting of participant roles.

AB  - This study examined the efficacy of a shared book-reading approach to integrating literacy and science instruction. The purpose was to determine whether teaching science vocabulary using information text could improve low-income preschoolers' word knowledge, conceptual development, and content knowledge in the life sciences. Teachers in 17 preschool classrooms and 268 children participated; nine classrooms were assigned to treatment, eight to control. The treatment group received a science-focused shared book-reading intervention, 4 days a week, 12-15 minutes daily for 12 weeks, while the control group continued with business as usual. Results indicated statistically and practically significant effects on children's word, concepts, and content knowledge and knowledge of the information text genre compared to the control group. However, we recognize the potential confound of district with treatment condition as a major limitation of the study.

AB  - In the present STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)-driven society, socioscientific issues (SSI) have become a focus globally and SSI research has grown into an important area of study in science education. Since students attending the social and science programs have a different focus in their studies and research has shown that students attending a science program are less familiar with argumentation practice, we make a comparison of the supporting reasons social science and science majors use in arguing different SSI with the goal to provide important information for pedagogical decisions about curriculum and instruction. As an analytical framework, a model termed SEE-SEP covering three aspects (of knowledge, value, and experiences) and six subject areas (of sociology/culture, economy, environment/ecology, science, ethics/morality, and policy) was adopted to analyze students' justifications. A total of 208 upper secondary students (105 social science majors and 103 science majors) from Sweden were invited to justify and expound their arguments on four SSI including global warming, genetically modified organisms (GMO), nuclear power, and consumer consumption. The results showed that the social science majors generated more justifications than the science majors, the aspect of value was used most in students' argumentation regardless of students' discipline background, and justifications from the subject area of science were most often presented in nuclear power and GMO issues. We conclude by arguing that engaging teachers from different subjects to cooperate when teaching argumentation on SSI could be of great value and provide students from both social science and science programs the best possible conditions in which to develop argumentation skills.

AB  - This study aims to test the nature of the assumption that there are relationships between scientific epistemological views (SEVs) and reasoning processes in socioscientific decision making. A mixed methodology that combines both qualitative and quantitative approaches of data collection and analysis was adopted not only to verify the assumption but also to explore the patterns of interaction between the two constructs. A total of 177 college students (60% science and 40% non-science majors) completed a SEVs survey and a decision-making instrument. The decision-making instrument contains expository text introducing the environmental management issue of an invasive species, and a series of open-ended questions to elicit participants' reasons and judgments on the issue. Analyses revealed that tentativeness and creativity of SEVs are the significant components directly manifested in the socioscientific decision-making process. Students who held changing and tentative beliefs about scientific knowledge were more likely to recognize the complexity, take multiple perspectives, and question omniscient authority in the decision-making process. It was also found that over one-half of the college students, especially those who were science majors, make decisions based on a single disciplinary perspective. The findings suggest that educational programs should encourage students to actively participate in issue investigation and decision making by utilizing multiple reasoning modes and interdisciplinary thinking.

AB  - This paper invites readers to reconsider the role of Art in the learning of social sciences in higher education based on the ability of the arts to promote understanding among students about their world of life. The new pathways opened up by multimodality offer access to vast repositories of images such as Flickr (Davies, 2007; Castañeda, 2009), and museums that exhibit high quality reproductions of their art collections (Google Art Project). Furthermore, students can express themselves by combining their own images with text (multiliteracies--The New London Group, 1996; Leander, K & Boldt, G., 2012). Multimodal literacy represents a powerful tool to observe and record of all kinds of interesting events for social science students that can be shared and debated on social media. Moreover, following John Dewey (1980) about aesthetic experience, the new form of literacy, as result of combining imagens and texts, represents an excellent way to trigger sensible and aesthetic feelings .

AB  - Students must be able to evaluate primary literature, yet few options exist within the undergraduate curriculum to develop the necessary skills. In this article, we offer an adapted journal club that provides students opportunities to critically analyze selected research articles, emphasizing scientific communication, critical thinking, and practical application of coursework. We include the primary instruments of the adapted journal club, teaching tips, and guided implementation recommendations, including tools to pre-designate student roles to examine specific aspects of the article. Using their preclass homework as a guide, students present their respective portions to the class as the class gains a collective understanding of the research design, experimental approach, and relative merits. This student-centric learning approach achieved significant gains in scientific literacy. Our data show a 37% increase in student abilities to analyze study design, a 61% gain in discerning primary from secondary sources, and gains of between 61% and 76% in the confidence to lead content-specific scientific discussions. We present this approach and suggest that grades, self-assessments, and surveys illustrate the benefits of the adapted journal club for the undergraduate learning experience.

AB  - The Science Cafe is a national movement that attempts to foster community dialog and inquiry on scientific topics in informal venues such as coffee houses, bookstores, restaurants and bars. The California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, Robert E. Kennedy Library staff have taken the Science Cafe model out of bars and cafes and into the university's library. They have created an outreach opportunity as the campus community comes together to share and discuss faculty research, student work, and outside speakers' knowledge. The Science Cafe programs encourage open, easy-to-understand conversation exploring scientific and interdisciplinary topics in an attempt to build connections among disciplines. Cal Poly's Science Cafe is unique as it is one of the first to be held in an academic setting and the only Science Cafe within 200 miles of the campus. The program's development is described below.

AB  - As the evidence of the benefits of multidisciplinary education accumulates many schools and instructors are finding ways of hybridizing courses to include substantial components of what are otherwise distinct sciences. Often, such course development is done with an eye toward industry, which requires a workforce capable of synthesizing varied fields of information. The biotech industry is on the forefront of this movement, and its requirements are pushing universities to educate students to be fluent in multiple sciences (Dahms 2001). In particular, the author states that a bridge is urgently needed between the biomedical/biotechnology and the mechanical engineering disciplines (Schrof 1999) to facilitate the development of improved medical devices and safer surgical procedures and for the characterization of biotissues and biotransport processes. In this article, a course integrating the fields of engineering and biology was developed to teach students to solve real-world problems that included aspects from both disciplines. Computer simulations were also developed and carried out, and findings were presented in a formal report format. Thus, the author states that such courses encourage interdepartmental cooperation between students and provide a broad view of the multidisciplinary nature of scientific exploration.

AB  - Worldwide, science education reform movements are stressing the need to promote "scientific literacy" among young people. Increasingly, this is taken to include empowering students to engage critically with science-related news reporting. Despite this requirement now featuring in statutory curricula throughout the UK, there has, to date, been a dearth of research-informed advice to assist science teachers as they identify appropriate instructional objectives in this regard and design relevant learning activities through which these might be achieved. In this study, prominent science communication scholars, science journalists, science educators and media educators were interviewed to determine what knowledge, skills and habits of mind they judged valuable for individuals reading science-related news stories. Teachers of science and of English from nine secondary schools in Northern Ireland addressed the same issue. A striking--and significant--finding of the study was the very substantial number of statements of knowledge, skill and disposition offered by participants that relate to "media awareness", an issue largely overlooked in the science education literature. The school-focused phase of the research suggests that cross-curricular approaches involving teachers of science collaborating with those of English/media education or media studies may best serve to address this important curricular goal.

AB  - Pre-service teachers from Texas and Indiana in the United States and from Queensland, Australia, observed the Moon for a semester and compared and contrasted their findings in asynchronous Internet discussion groups. The 188 pre-service teachers were required to conduct inquiry investigations for their methods coursework which included an initial Moon observation assignment, an Internet Moon discussion, and a final project. The Moon context was chosen for its motivating capability, its inherent interdisciplinary makeup, its inclusion in the National Science Education Standards, and its ability to be viewed worldwide. This study was of a mixed method research design and involved pre-service teachers' journals, summative reflections, Internet discussions, final projects, and the Lunar Phases Concept Inventory (LPCI). Analysis of the qualitative data was conducted through the exploration of patterns and themes that illustrated pre-service teachers' conceptual development, and the LPCI was administered as a pre/post assessment. We found that our project led to increased knowledge concerning the mathematics and science involved with understanding the Moon and its phases. We also found that it was beneficial to have Internet discussions with pre-service teachers from around the world, but it was not without its problems (e.g., coordinating schedules and lack of participation by some participants). We discovered that pre-service teachers' exposure to the new uses of technology for teaching and learning did not necessarily translate to their planning to adopt similar techniques in their own classrooms.

AB  - The adoption of Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) in Spain has affected educational spending and introduced modifications in learning and assessment procedures for students. While positive effects are noticeable in terms of language learning, evidence concerning the impact on non-linguistic subject areas has been less forthcoming. This study, which forms part of the wider MON-CLIL investigation into CLIL instruction in monolingual areas of Spain, aims to contribute to the developing body of knowledge by comparing academic performance in science in primary education and natural science in compulsory secondary education. In addition to comparing school results for a sample of 93 public, charter (semi-private) and private primary students and 139 public and charter secondary students (total = 232), this study also involved a stepwise discriminant analysis with other potential intervening variables in order to determine the extent to which differences might be due to instruction type or to other factors. Significant differences were detected between certain school types in favour of non-CLIL groups in primary education, while differences also existed between public secondary groups in favour of CLIL. These findings seem to indicate that CLIL instruction had no detrimental effects on the science learning of the secondary learners participating in the study.

AB  - This interdisciplinary activity promotes science, technology, and language arts and is well suited for upper elementary grade students. In the activity, students' research about a teacher-assigned weather phenomenon facilitates their study of the weather. When they have completed their research, students word process a paper summarizing their findings and generate graphical representations of a weather phenomenon using Microsoft Paint software. The paper and the computer-generated graphical representation measure learning and provide insight into the level of student understanding that other assessment tools, such as quizzes, tests, and questioning techniques, do not provide.

AB  - The requirements engineering course is a core component of the curriculum for the Master's in Software Engineering programme, at Monmouth University (MU). It covers the process, methods and tools specific to this area, together with the corresponding software quality issues. The need to produce software engineers with strong teamwork and communication skills, capable of working in multidisciplinary teams, has been stressed repeatedly by industry world-wide. This paper reports on the multidisciplinary and active/collaborative approaches used in teaching requirements engineering at MU. To reinforce the concepts learned, students actively participate in their learning as they play different roles for eliciting requirements, or share their particular expertise with their teams when performing object-oriented analysis. The multidisciplinary experiment brought together software engineering and business management students. They collaborated to produce a software requirements specification for managerial processes involved in hiring and performance evaluation of employees within a firm. A description of the synchronization of the lectures with project deliverables in the two courses, different types of communication needed by students, positive interdependence of the teams across disciplines, and how they contributed to the success of the project will be discussed among other multidisciplinary issues encountered during this experiment.

AB  - The popularity of forensic science in schools continues to grow alongside the proportion of prime time scheduling devoted to CSI television shows. Yet the understanding of how forensic tests are used in narrowing down a field of possible suspects to the point where just one can be arrested or taken to trial is far less well understood. Students fall for the imagined glamour and glory of mapping blood splatters with no awareness of the role of ICT and computing in the logging and analysis of the data generated in the laboratory. The CSI Schools Project has grown from the realisation that ICT specialists and science education practitioners have a lot to offer one another. By piggy-backing on the popularity of forensic science, databases can be made enticing enough to hold the attention of reluctant learners, and ICT can be thoroughly embedded within the curriculum as a tool that enables higher cognitive skills to develop. Practical activities give the opportunity for students to develop hypotheses and can help put knowledge into context to enhance the learning experience. In this article, the authors describe an engaging and inspiring STEM activity that showcases the power of databases and cloud computing.

AB  - Developing and applying oral and written communication skills in the undergraduate computer science and computer information systems curriculum--one of the ABET accreditation requirements - is a very challenging and, at the same time, a rewarding task that provides various opportunities to enrich the undergraduate computer science and computer information systems curriculum. We discuss a comprehensive three-step program developed at our institution that provides opportunities to efficiently develop oral and written communication skills. We present our successful experience of integrating a project component into a core introductory course designed to focus on developing these skills. We discuss and present the results of interdisciplinary collaborations between Computer Science and English faculty members to achieve the goals of the project. We also discuss a Senior Design Project course sequence and a Research Topics in Computer Science course, and the opportunities that these courses provide to develop oral and written communication skills.

AB  - Allen Kent was a pioneer in many aspects of library and information science (LIS), and yet, as this author reads Kent's 1977 article, there is not much in it that has become ancient, irrelevant history. The questions he discusses are still alive in the discipline in 2014, whether it is called LIS (library and information science), information science, information studies, or an "iSchool education." In this article, the author provides a brief history of Allen Kent, and then discusses her reactions to his article on information science.

AB  - Traditional secondary science education draws on markedly different pedagogies than those made use of in contemporary environmental education, therefore, embedding environmental education within secondary science curriculum presents both epistemological and practical difficulties for teachers. This ethnographic study examines the work of six secondary science teachers in Northern Ontario, Canada, as they engage in an action research project focused on merging environmental education in their science lessons. Over the course of five months the teachers examine and discuss their views and their professional development related to the project. In the place of definitive conclusions, six propositions relating the work of secondary science teachers to environmental education, form the basis for a discussion of the implications of the study. The implications are particularly relevant to secondary schools in Ontario, Canada, where the embedding of environmental education in science studies has been mandated. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Discussions held in the chemical education community have generated a variety of reports and recommendations for reforming the chemistry curriculum. The recommendations refer to teaching chemistry in the context of real-world issues. This has been suggested as a way to enhance students' motivation. It is suggested that real-world problems emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of chemistry and the relevance of chemistry to the students' lives. An attempt was made to incorporate these recommendations into the teaching of chemistry by teaching analytical chemistry together with environmental chemistry. A unit incorporating analytical chemistry in an environmental context was developed, in which the students learn concepts of a specific environmental issue. The unit "I Have Chemistry with the Environment", consisting of two modules, was developed on the topics of drinking-water quality, and the greenhouse effect. The research questions focus on the change in the attitudes and perceptions of the students toward chemistry and environmental issues, after learning the environmental unit. The results indicate that the students underwent a significant change in their awareness of environmental issues. All the students mentioned that the unit influenced their everyday-life perceptions of environmental issues and that their awareness of environmental issues increased. Another important finding was that more students found that learning the "I Have Chemistry with the Environment" unit encouraged them to learn chemistry. They indicated that they especially appreciated the feeling that they could discover things by themselves. Clearly, the students found that learning the unit was relevant to chemistry learning as well as to their personal lives. Researchers believe that such a program may promote education for sustainable development. (Contains 4 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - Molecular life science is one of the fastest-growing fields of scientific and technical innovation, and biotechnology has profound effects on many aspects of daily life--often with deep, ethical dimensions. At the same time, the content is inherently complex, highly abstract, and deeply rooted in diverse disciplines ranging from "pure sciences," such as math, chemistry, and physics, through "applied sciences," such as medicine and agriculture, to subjects that are traditionally within the remit of humanities, notably philosophy and ethics. Together, these features pose diverse, important, and exciting challenges for tomorrow's teachers and educational establishments. With backgrounds in molecular life science research and secondary life science teaching, we (Tibell and Rundgren, respectively) bring different experiences, perspectives, concerns, and awareness of these issues. Taking the nature of the discipline as a starting point, we highlight important facets of molecular life science that are both characteristic of the domain and challenging for learning and education. Of these challenges, we focus most detail on content, reasoning difficulties, and communication issues. We also discuss implications for education research and teaching in the molecular life sciences.

AB  - For the past 23 years, students at California State Polytechnic University at Pomona have benefited from its Interdisciplinary General Education Program (IGE)--a sequential, interdisciplinary general education program that culminates in a capstone course. IGE's history and structure support a strong culture of assessment. The program, founded in 1983 with an emphasis on measuring student learning outcomes, was designed to provide an integrated liberal arts experience to students attending a comprehensive public polytechnic university. To accomplish this, student cohorts complete an eight-quarter sequence of interdisciplinary classes that satisfy humanities and social sciences general education requirements. Interdisciplinary General Education Program (IGE) promotes deep, integrative learning as advocated by Ernest Boyer: "As students see how the content of one course relates to that of others, they begin to make connections, and in so doing gain not only a more integrated view of knowledge, but also a more authentic view of life". The curriculum and instructional approach encourage students to become what the American Association of Colleges and Universities' Greater Expectations report calls "intentional learners"--individuals who are empowered, informed, and responsible. The article describes how a departmental culture focused on assessment that enabled IGE faculty members to examine this capstone experience and make changes that have substantially improved student learning.

AB  - At the University of Maryland, an interdisciplinary team of researchers from information studies, computer science, education, art, and psychology worked with seven children (ages seven to eleven) to design a new digital library for children. This partnership led to new approaches for collection development, cataloging (metadata standards), and new technologies for information access and use. The team validated the importance of working with children by analyzing the results of Weblogs, surveys, and lab user studies. This article presents a discussion of the interdisciplinary research landscape that contributes to an understanding of digital libraries for children, examines a case study on the development of the International Children's Digital Library, and discusses the implications from this research as they relate to new technology design methods with children and new directions for future digital libraries.

AB  - We present a descriptive case study of Terrascope, an innovative, year-long, project-based learning community at MIT. Each year, Terrascope students study a particular environmental or Earth-system problem from a multidisciplinary perspective. Terrascope includes both academic and non-academic components; this paper focuses on the academic components. The objectives of the academic subjects, and of the program as a whole, involve helping students develop their team-building, communication, problem-solving, and self-regulatory learning skills. This study focuses on cohorts of students from the first and second years of the program (2002-2003 and 2003-2004); it is based on end-of-semester surveys and focus groups, and on additional focus groups conducted when these students were upperclassmen. Students felt Terrascope helped them make significant improvements in their ability to work in teams and to take on complex, multidisciplinary problems. They felt that the program's two-semester structure gave them an opportunity to develop and nurture these skills, and that the program prepared them well for their later work at MIT. They also felt that being engaged, as freshmen, in a distinct learning community, significantly eased their transition into MIT. We describe lessons learned in the development of Terrascope and offer suggestions for other institutions planning to develop similar programs.

AB  - Twentieth-century novelist and physicist C. P. Snow famously stated that solving the world's complex problems requires collaboration between humanists and scientists. Here, the authors agree with Snow and illustrate one integrated educational approach that bridges the two cultures of science and religion to transform the learning and teaching of science. George Ellis, the renowned humanitarian and physicist, refines and enhances Snow's vision, describing the need for three integrated and equally important kinds of experts required to address contemporary complex issues. These are focused basic researchers, generalists who take a broad view, and synthesizers who integrate the two (Ellis 1994). They believe there are approaches to enhancing science education and developing learners of all three types Ellis identifies. (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - Much of the research on students' understanding of the greenhouse effect and global warming reports poor results. Students are claimed to hold misconceptions and naive beliefs, and the impact of teaching on their conceptions is also low. In the present study, these results are called into question, and it is argued that they may to a large extent be seen as artifacts of the research methods deployed, in particular when written questionnaires are used. When following students' project work in school over a long period, many of the misunderstandings reported in the literature do not appear. It is argued that the appropriation and use of scientific language when discussing complex socioscientific issues is a gradual process. When observing the language and mediational means students use over time, it is obvious that they are able to identify and use central distinctions in their interactions. They are also able to make productive use of texts and other materials that allow them to successively approximate scientific modes of reasoning. Thus, what students know emerges in communicative practices where they interact with others and with cultural tools in a focused activity. It is argued that students' knowledge of complex multidisciplinary phenomena of this kind may be particularly ill-suited to conventional questionnaire types of testing.

AB  - The study analyses the extent to which the sociological message transmitted by the teachers' pedagogic practice recontextualizes the official pedagogic discourse of the natural sciences curriculum for a Portuguese middle school. Theoretically, the study is based on theories of psychology (e.g. Vygotsky), epistemology (e.g. Ziman) and sociology, with a particular emphasis on Bernstein's theory of pedagogic discourse. A mixed methodology was used in the study. The results suggest the existence of processes of transformation of the message within the Ministry of Education, when passing from the general principles to the specific principles of the curriculum. Transformation is in the direction of decreasing the quality of science education. The results of the curriculum analysis are discussed with regard to specific characteristics studied: metascientific knowledge, scientific knowledge and competences, intradisciplinary relations and evaluation criteria. The results also showed a decrease in the quality of the teaching-learning process when recontextualizing curriculum into pedagogic practices. This is shown by the absence by teachers of recognition and passive and active realization rules in most of the characteristics under study. These processes of transformation of the message are discussed, as well as its consequences in terms of scientific literacy.

AB  - The ethnography presented by van Eijck and Roth focuses on the activities of people involved in a government funded internship program in conservation and restoration, which was offered by a "multidisciplinary research center" through a local First Nation adult education center. The internship was designed, in partnership with a local non-profit conservation society (OceanHealth), to appeal to First Nation men and women considering career change, returning to school, or re-entering the work place. The primary aim of the internship was to "provide authentic science for diverse student populations (and their teachers), with particular attention to the needs of students from First Nations, to become scientifically literate to the extent that it prepares them for participating in public debates, community decision-making, and personal living consistent with long-term environmentally sustainable forms of life". The authors report that at least one of the two interns was not interested in science and a WSANEC elder expressed dissatisfaction with the efforts to establish the nature park and its current approved uses. Van Eijck and Roth argue that the divergence between the project aims and the goals of the participants are a result of how "place" is viewed in place-based education and that disagreements like these can be resolved if place is theorized as chronotope. There are many interesting ideas raised and directions taken in the article by van Eijck and Roth. After several discussions during the review process, we decided to focus our forum response on the meaning of "place" in place-based education, the utility of theorizing place as a chronotope, the implications for teaching-learning ("education"), and musings on what remains unclear.

AB  - This research draws on developments in educational research where "learning progressions" are emerging as a strategy for synthesizing research on science learning and applying that research to policy and practice, and advances in the natural sciences, where "interdisciplinary research on coupled human and natural systems" has become increasingly important. It focuses on the human systems that supply all of our essential goods and services (i.e., food, water, transportation), which begin and end in the earth's natural systems. In order to investigate what students know about how human actions affect environmental systems, we developed assessments focusing on "supply and waste disposal chains". In addition, students were asked about a major environmental issue--global warming. Assessments were administered to elementary, middle, and high school students from rural, suburban, and urban schools. Results from this study provide insight into how student knowledge of connections between human-engineered and natural systems varies across grade level and context, which is essential if we are to teach students to be responsible citizens and stewards of our environment.

AB  - Providing effective food safety education to young consumers is a national health priority to combat the nearly 76 million cases of foodborne illness in the United States annually. With the tremendous pressures on teachers for accountability in core subject areas, the focus of classrooms is on covering concepts that are tested on state performance examinations. As a result, topics such as food safety are rarely addressed in middle school classrooms. Middle school is an ideal time to teach food safety because adolescents are in the process of setting lifelong behaviors; therefore, they are more likely to synthesize new food safety knowledge in a way that will lead to the development of lifelong behaviors. The purpose of this study was to scientifically validate an educational resource that provides a method for classroom teachers to involve young consumers in food safety education while meeting state content area curriculum standards. An interdisciplinary curriculum targeted at middle school students and correlated directly to state content standards was designed to include highly effective instructional strategies that teach food safety concepts through all core subject classes (science, math, social studies, and language arts). The curriculum was pilot tested in 5 schools using a pretest, posttest, and follow-up test assessment model. The results showed that the curriculum was highly effective at raising student knowledge (21% gain) and improving students' food handling behaviors (8.47% gain) from pretests to posttests. In addition, 6 wk after implementation, students retained 86% of their total knowledge gain as measured by a follow-up assessment.

AB  - A systematic and longitudinal analysis of all of the education-related articles published in two of political science's oldest journals reveals that political science has aided our knowledge of education by focusing on the distribution of power in the decision-making process, the organization and governance of public school systems, and the outcomes and effects of education policy decisions. Moreover, the present data suggest that only a tiny fraction of the major articles published in traditional political science journals have focused on education and that those political scientists conducting education research turn to multidisciplinary education journals as outlets for their scholarship.

AB  - We describe a unique Research Experience for Undergraduates and Research Experience for Veterinary students summer program at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis on the campus of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. The program focused on interdisciplinary research at the interface of biology and mathematics. Participants were selected to work on projects with a biology mentor and a mathematics mentor in an environment that promoted collaboration outside of the students' respective disciplines. There were four research projects with teams of four participants and two faculty mentors. The participants consisted of a mixture of 10 undergraduates in biology- and mathematics-related disciplines, four veterinary students, and two high-school teachers. The activities included lectures on both the biological and mathematical backgrounds of the projects, tutorials for software, and sessions on ethics, graduate school, and possible career paths for individuals interested in biology and mathematics. The program was designed to give students the ability to actively participate in the scientific research process by working on a project, writing up their results in a final report, and presenting their work orally. We report on the results of our evaluation surveys of the participants. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - In this paper, the authors argue that chemical knowledge in the classroom will be enriched by the application of characterizations of models drawn from a range of disciplinary backgrounds. This discussion highlights two important issues relating to chemical knowledge in the classroom: (1) the status of chemical knowledge in the classroom, particularly in the  context of models; and (2) chemistry learners' engagement in the modelling of the structure and function of matter, which is a central feature of chemistry. This discussion draws on evidence from several bodies of literature. First, the authors review the literature on the applications of history and philosophy of science in science education. This review illustrates the broader context for the study of chemical knowledge for educational purposes and highlights the weaknesses in the literature in respect of philosophical considerations of chemical knowledge in general. Second, they examine the role of models and modelling in philosophy of science, cognitive psychology, chemistry and chemistry education, and the  interdisciplinary characterisations that provide a context for the reconceptualization of the nature of chemical knowledge in the classroom. The interdisciplinary approach includes perspectives on philosophical accounts of models that begin to address a significant aspect of the nature of chemical knowledge. The discussion concludes with some implications for theory of learning, curriculum design, and teacher education. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - Integrating the worlds of art and science can be a perfect tool for engaging students who wouldn't be initially interested in a science class. Even those students who love science may delve deeper into the subject when it's associated with art. One way to make this connection is to explore the life and work of great nature artists of the past and present. According to Content Standard G (History and Nature of Science) of the National Science Education Standards, "Science is very much a human endeavor, and the work of science relies on basic human qualities, such as reasoning, insight, energy, skill, and creativity" (NRC 1996, p. 130). Integrating the life and work of those who have successfully combined these disciplines into the science curriculum demonstrates that science is a human endeavor and has the potential to inspire students' creativity. Students may gain a newfound appreciation for the wonder and beauty of science. (Contains 3 figures and 8 resources.)

AB  - To help students learn science concepts, Pharmacology Education Partnership (PEP)--a science education program that incorporates relevant topics related to drugs and drug abuse into standard biology and chemistry curricula was developed. The interdisciplinary PEP curriculum provides six modules to teach biology and chemistry principles within the context of pharmacology topics (e.g., drugs of abuse, nerve gas). Teaching modules include catchy names, such as "Acids, Bases, and Cocaine Addicts," "Steroids and Athletes: Genes Work Overtime," and "How Do Drugs Damage Neurons: It's Radical!". To date, PEP has provided professional development for 300 biology and chemistry teachers participating in the studies (and another 100 teachers at ongoing workshops). National field-testing of the curriculum in approximately 16,000 students reveals that the more PEP modules the teachers use, the better their students perform on tests of biology and chemistry concepts. An additional benefit of this approach might also be to students make intelligent decisions about drug use, although this remains to be tested. Substantial gains in achievement may be possible when high school students are taught science using topics that are interesting and relevant to their lives.

AB  - Science education reform initiatives emphasize (1) the value of concepts over facts; (2) the benefits of open-ended, inquiry-based problem-solving rather than protocols leading to a single correct answer; and (3) the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to teaching that is not confined by departmental boundaries. Neuroscientists should be at the forefront of this movement by the very nature of the discipline we study. Neuroscience is a relatively new field that integrates diverse subjects (anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, molecular biology, computer science, and psychology) and experimental advances are constantly changing and expanding our understanding of brain function. How can we convey this excitement in the classroom? The project described in this article uses nonscientific literature to introduce a scientific topic of study. In addition, the multitask assignment requires the acquisition of content knowledge and the development of critical thinking skills. As students explore the topic from multiple perspectives, they recognize the interconnectedness of science and society and confront ethical and moral issues related to science. A comparison of exam scores, essay responses, engagement level, as well as students' own reflections, demonstrates that inclusion of the project does not sacrifice content knowledge, rather it enhances the overall learning process.

AB  - This study examined relationships between important aspects of a university education and the assessment and development of generic skills. A sample of 323 students enrolled in single or double arts, engineering and/or science degrees from a research-intensive university in Australia were administered the Graduate Skills Assessment to measure four generic skills--critical thinking, interpersonal understandings, problem solving and written communication. As expected, students' grade point average was generally found to be significantly related to scores for all four skill scales both within each discipline area and across the total sample. Reporting of academic achievement through the GPA therefore provides some measure of students' generic skill levels. However, since relationships were modest, GPA should be considered an imperfect indicator of levels of generic skills attainment. In addition, we found only limited evidence that students' skill levels increased with progression through their studies, with study length being consistently related only to Problem Solving. Finally, our analyses revealed significant, interdisciplinary variations in students' skill scores. Results are discussed with respect to theoretical, practical and methodological implications.

AB  - Santa Clara University's Robotic Systems Laboratory conducts an aggressive robotic development and operations program in which interdisciplinary teams of undergraduate students build and deploy a wide range of robotic systems, ranging from underwater vehicles to spacecraft. These year-long projects expose students to the breadth of and interdependence among engineering disciplines, the span of processes in a system development lifecycle, and the challenges of managing a development process. Over the past five years, this program has provided more than 150 students with exposure to computer science and engineering topics, including software engineering, algorithm development, human-computer interface design, and artificial intelligence. This program provides exciting and compelling educational opportunities for students, offers real-world applications that naturally motivate the need for specific computing technologies, and serves a broader research and development program that utilizes the functional robotic systems to support externally-funded science and technology demonstration missions. The experience of the authors, as well as formal program assessment data, show that this program provides strong student motivation for learning, offers comprehensive and valuable educational experiences, and enhances student performance. This article reviews the Santa Clara robotics program, highlights the role of computer science and engineering in several projects, and presents the assessment data showing the positive results of this program.

AB  - Clinical teams are of growing importance to healthcare delivery, but little is known about how teams learn and change their clinical practice. We examined how teams in three US hospitals succeeded in making significant practice improvements in the area of antimicrobial resistance. This was a qualitative cross-case study employing Soft Knowledge Systems as a conceptual framework. The purpose was to describe how teams produced, obtained, and used knowledge and information to bring about successful change. A purposeful sampling strategy was used to maximize variation between cases. Data were collected through interviews, archival document review, and direct observation. Individual case data were analyzed through a two-phase coding process followed by the cross-case analysis. Project teams varied in size and were multidisciplinary. Each project had more than one champion, only some of whom were physicians. Team members obtained relevant knowledge and information from multiple sources including the scientific literature, experts, external organizations, and their own experience. The success of these projects hinged on the teams' ability to blend scientific evidence, practical knowledge, and clinical data. Practice change was a longitudinal, iterative learning process during which teams continued to acquire, produce, and synthesize relevant knowledge and information and test different strategies until they found a workable solution to their problem. This study adds to our understanding of how teams learn and change, showing that innovation can take the form of an iterative, ongoing process in which bits of K&I are assembled from multiple sources into potential solutions that are then tested. It suggests that existing approaches to assessing the impact of continuing education activities may overlook significant contributions and more attention should be given to the role that practical knowledge plays in the change process in addition to scientific knowledge.

AB  - The new reorganization of university education has involved relevant changes in teaching and learning methodologies in order to help students to learn more effectively and to develop important skills and competences demanded by the professional world. In this sense the new configuration of the degree in Chemical Engineering required the identification of the main general and transferable skills, the implementation of the new teaching and learning strategies necessary to achieve them and, in addition, an evaluation procedure for determining the importance and the degree of development of a student's skills and competences. In this exercise, two obligatory chemical reactor engineering subjects of the still-in-effect Chemical Engineering degree were chosen as examples of competence-based learning disciplines. For each one, a significant group of transferable and specific skills were selected to be developed. The identification and selection of skills was made according to the recommendations of the European Federation of Chemical Engineering (EFCE) together with the established requirements in the ministerial order for the new Chemical Engineering Degree (Ministerial order CIN/351/2009). In order to check the effectiveness of teaching strategies in helping students to acquire these abilities, specific questionnaires were designed. These tests allowed for the utility of the competences in question to be evaluated in terms of the students' professional work as future chemical engineering graduates and also facilitated the perception of skill development acquired through the methodology implemented in these subjects. The results of the skill evaluation questionnaires revealed the importance that both university collectives (students and professors) give to the development of transferable skills. These skills included the ability to communicate effectively (including in English), to work in multidisciplinary teams and learn on one's own accord, and to be aware of the need for life-long learning. Furthermore, students and teachers agreed that there is a direct correlation between the higher development of specific skills and the chemical engineering learning outcomes. In this sense, an important effort should be devoted to the development of a students' transferable skills by way of modifying the current teaching-learning system (partial substitution of lectures with tutorials and seminars, strategies based on problem-solving, projects and case studies (individual or student team-work), use of internet and electronic tools, etc.).

AB  - Family and consumer sciences (FCS) education has traditionally attracted a large percentage of female students (Vincenti, 1997; Werhan, 2013). Werhan (2013) reported that slightly less than 3.5 million students are engaged in FCS courses, and at the high school level, approximately 65% of them are female. This skewed representation of female students in FCS generally has been attributed to the impression that the fields of study typically encompassed under the FCS curricular umbrella have been female-dominated, because "home" historically was considered the woman's realm (Davis, 2008). To meet the needs for a STEM-capable citizenry, a STEM-proficient workforce, and future STEM experts, the Nation must focus on two complementary goals: We must prepare all students, including girls and minorities who are underrepresented in these fields, to be proficient in STEM subjects. We must also inspire all students to learn STEM and, in the process, motivate many of them to pursue STEM careers. Due to the high representation of females in FCS, aligning STEM with FCS more deliberately, even at an early age in schools, may contribute to an increase of women in STEM education and in the national STEM workforce.
