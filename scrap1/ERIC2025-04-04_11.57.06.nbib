AB  - This study explores science teachers' views regarding Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) pedagogy and its interdisciplinary nature. It also seeks to identify teachers' views on the contextual factors that facilitate and hinder such pedagogy in their schools. Qualitative methodologies were used through focus group discussions and an interview protocol. From the specific contextual issues that were highlighted in the findings, was teacher self-efficacy, pedagogical-knowledge, issues related to establishing a collaborative school culture and familiarity to STEM education among school administrators, students and parents. Findings expressed teachers' concerns of their under-preparedness to enact STEM practices and illustrated that engineering is the least mentioned discipline to be integrated with science. The study ends with recommendations that could lead to develop a professional development model to enact STEM education in schools based on valuing partnership with universities and industries as a necessary step for enacting a STEM integrated model.

AB  - Modern science education the world over deliberately remains in the objective, rational, positivist paradigm. In South African classrooms, this paradigm is often alienating for young learners who then stop learning science at the end of Grade 9. Literature indicates that an arts-rich education improves learner engagement, attitudes and test scores, as evidenced by science Nobel laureates who engage more with the arts than other scientists. The research reported in this study involved the presentation of a lesson on acids and bases to 222 Grade 9 learners in 4 schools in the greater Tshwane region to establish whether their interest levels in the subject would improve when using a poem and video that characterise, describe and demonstrate scientific concepts. An in-class intervention of 40 minutes was used with identical Likert-scale, pre and post-tests analysed using the Wilcoxon and "t"-test. The results showed that the arts-rich lesson engaged learners in a manner which holistically improved their interest levels. The results were independent of gender, home language and the type of large, urban, government school that they attended. The results were not significant for the small, semi-rural, private school research site.

AB  - A new multi-disciplinary degree program in education and information studies was developed to uniquely facilitate educators' capacity to be responsive to the demands of a digitally connected world. Charles Sturt University's Master of Education (Knowledge Networks and Digital Innovation) aims to develop agile leaders in new cultures of digital formal and informal learning. The co-construction of knowledge through interpersonal discourse creates a pedagogical tension between a focus on knowledge-based instruction and outcomes, and on praxis-based instruction. This digital context draws attention to academic integrity issues in online learning environments. Through the new subject Game-Based Learning, students engaged in theory, practice, trends in game designs and immersive aspects of game, utilizing the technology and pedagogical affordances of a range of online tools. The subject builds on the keystone subject and incorporates reflective participation and a culture of participatory learning through integration of social media, social scholarship and open sharing of ideas, resources and experiences online within the broader education community. Subject engagement and assessment design incorporated academic integrity strategies, and needed individual and group collaboration to be fully integrated into the learning experience of the students, thus modeling practices relevant to the student's own processional practices. This paper also considers the contribution of global connectedness to the success of the pedagogic processes used for embedding academic integrity through social scholarship into the curriculum and learning experiences.

AB  - A mixed-methods research study was designed to examine teachers' knowledge and confidence for implementing a STEM-based problem-based learning (PBL) unit in their 6-12 grade science and math classrooms. Twenty-one teachers (7 in-service and 13 pre-service) participated in an intensive two-week summer workshop during which they engaged in, and then created, an immersive PBL unit related to sustainable energy. Data were collected through a pre-post content knowledge test and two pre-post surveys--one measuring knowledge and confidence for implementing PBL and one measuring science teaching efficacy. Daily reflections and focus group interviews provided additional data regarding teachers' changing knowledge and confidence related to both content and PBL methods. Results revealed significant gains in content knowledge related to concepts in energy, confidence for implementing PBL, and science teaching efficacy. Implications for the professional development of rural STEM teachers and the importance of engaging teachers in a professional development experience that integrates STEM content and PBL methods also are discussed.

AB  - This work describes the educational experiences gained teaching the Senior Design I & II courses, a senior level, two-semester sequence in the Electrical Engineering (EE) program at Georgia Southern University (GSU). In particular, the authors present their experiences in using robotics as the main area to develop the capstone senior design, with focus in interdisciplinary interactions and teamwork for the design and implementation of autonomous mobile robots. The other main purpose of the capstone design course sequence is for the students to experience working in an engineering application project researching and analyzing the sustainability, ethical and social impact issues related to their projects. The students work for two semesters as a team to design, test and build a mobile robot project for a particular application. Some of these projects have been fabricated to participate in different robotic competitions, including the IEEE sponsored hardware competition, the lawn mower competition, and the robot waiter competition.

AB  - Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses computer-based algorithms and methods to gain insights from large and often complex datasets. Data science, which includes Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Machine Learning (ML), has been credited with the promise to transform Health Professions Education (HPE) by offering approaches to handle big (and often messy) data.To examine this promise, we conducted a critical review to explore: (1) published applications of data science and ML in HPE literature and (2) the potential role of data science and ML in shifting theoretical and epistemological perspectives in HPE research and practice. Existing data science studies in HPE are often not informed by theory, but rather oriented towards developing applications for specific problems, uses, and contexts.The most common areas currently being studied are procedural (e.g., computer-based tutoring or adaptive systems and assessment of technical skills). We found that epistemic beliefs informing the use of data science and ML in HPE poses a challenge for existing views on what constitutes objective knowledge and the role of human subjectivity for instruction and assessment.As a result, criticisms have emerged that the integration of data science in the field of HPE is in danger of becoming technically driven and narrowly focused in its approach to teaching, learning and assessment. Our findings suggest that researchers tend to formalize around the epistemological stance driven largely by traditions of a research paradigm. Future data science studies in HPE need to involve both education scientists and data scientists to ensure mutual advancements in the development of educational theory and practical applications. This may be one of the most important tasks in the integration of data science and ML in HPE research in the years to come.

AB  - This article explores the place of complexity science within education and educational research. The discussion begins with the suggestion that educational research has a history of adopting interpretive frames from other domains with little adaptation. Complexity science is argued to compel a different sort of positioning, one that requires accommodation and participation rather than unproblematized assimilation and application. The argument is developed by considering the following simultaneities in education (and) research: knower and knowledge; transphenomenality; transdisciplinarity; interdiscursivity; descriptive and pragmatic insights; representation and presentation; affect and effect; and education and research.

AB  - Museums promote co-learning through the construction of a social community, one that involves personal, physical, and sociocultural contexts. As researchers and museum educators, we report some of our contextual reflections and recommendations that emerged from our collaborative learning experience of conducting research in a medical science museum. Guided by an established 6P model of museum learning ("place," "purpose," "person," "people," "process," and "product"), we articulate our experiences and propose an additional P ("partnership") with eight steps--beginning with relationship building and culminating in dissemination to varied audiences. Using examples from our research of children and young adolescents' experience of a science and health-related museum program entitled "Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse," we identify principles, factors, and processes that contributed to the success of our museum-based research. By presenting the lessons we learned, we aim to help guide future research endeavors of others considering interdisciplinary museum research.

AB  - Development of environmental literacy needs an interdisciplinary effort. Especially language classes, with environment related texts, have potential to support environmental literacy. In this research it is aimed to analyze the Turkish language course books in terms of components of environmental literacy. To this end, four Turkish course books being taught between 5th and 8th grades were selected. As a qualitative inquiry technique content analysis was used. Three types of main components of environmental literacy (knowledge, affect, and behavior) and their sub-components determined. It was found that the most cited environmental literacy component was knowledge. Others were relatively less emphasized. Results showed that Turkish course books with environment related texts have potential to support development of environmental literacy.

AB  - Despite advances to move anatomy education away from its didactic history, there is a continued need for students to contextualize their studies to make learning more meaningful. This article investigates authentic learning in the context of an inquiry-based approach to learning human gross anatomy. Utilizing a case-study design with three groups of students (n = 18) and their facilitators (n = 3), methods of classroom observations, interviews, and artifact collection were utilized to investigate students' experiences of learning through an inquiry project. Qualitative data analysis through open and selective coding produced common meaningful themes of group and student experiences. Overall results demonstrate how the project served as a unique learning experience where learners engaged in the opportunity to make sense of anatomy in context of their interests and wider interdisciplinary considerations through collaborative, group-based investigation. Results were further considered in context of theoretical frameworks of inquiry-based and authentic learning. Results from this study demonstrate how students can engage anatomical understandings to inquire and apply disciplinary considerations to their personal lives and the world around them.

AB  - It has become increasingly apparent that no single method for teaching anatomy is able to provide supremacy over another. In an effort to consolidate and enhance learning, a modernized anatomy curriculum was devised by attempting to take advantage of and maximize the benefits from different teaching methods. Both the more traditional approaches to anatomy teaching, as well as modern, innovative educational programs were embraced in a multimodal system implemented over a decade. In this effort, traditional teaching with lectures and dissection was supplemented with models, imaging, computer-assisted learning, problem-based learning through clinical cases, surface anatomy, clinical correlation lectures, peer teaching and team-based learning. Here, we review current thinking in medical education and present our transition from a passive, didactic, highly detailed anatomy course of the past, to a more interactive, as well as functionally and clinically relevant anatomy curriculum over the course of a decade.

AB  - A modern school should encourage students to deepen the subjects autonomously and beyond the normal curricula. Such aim, requiring both well-disposed pupils and cooperative teachers, was reached by the pioneering interdisciplinary project "From Soccerene to Fullerene" in 2013. The scientific education was noticeably improved, especially for the mathematical aspect, through a constructivist activity never tried before in the Italian school system.

AB  - Although interdisciplinary efforts in teaching and research are promoted as a possible antidote to increasing disciplinary separatism in colleges and universities, evaluations of interdisciplinary efforts in the classroom, particularly those spanning the traditional science-humanities divide, are not frequently documented. This article describes the development, execution, and assessment of a unique effort in interdisciplinary teaching in which four doctoral candidates from widely varying home disciplines collaborated to create and teach a "truly interdisciplinary" course for first-year students centered on the pervasiveness of humankind's quest for immortality. Assessment of the course indicates several desirable student outcomes, including the development of a more mature world view and appreciation for different epistemologies, which recommend the continuation of this and similar interdisciplinary efforts. While students at times found the enormous number of disciplines potentially related to the central topic overwhelming, at the conclusion of the course, they largely identified the exposure to new perspectives as an exciting and worthwhile academic experience. Similar interdisciplinary efforts in the classroom are encouraged, though ample course development time is recommended to maximize success. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - With the continuous growth of cyberinfrastructure throughout modern society, the need for secure computing and communication is more important than ever before. As a result, there is also an increasing need for entry-level developers who are capable of designing and building practical solutions for systems with stringent security requirements. This calls for careful attention to algorithm choice and implementation method, as well as trade-offs between hardware and software implementations. This article describes motivation and efforts taken by three departments at Rochester Institute of Technology (Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Software Engineering) that were focused on creating a multidisciplinary course that integrates the algorithmic, engineering, and practical aspects of security as exemplified by applied cryptography. In particular, the article presents the structure of this new course, topics covered, lab tools and results from the first two spring quarter offerings in 2011 and 2012.

AB  - In this essay, we explore how sustainability is embodied in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), analyzing how the NGSS explicitly define and implicitly characterize sustainability. We identify three themes (universalism, scientism, and technocentrism) that are common in scientific discourse around sustainability and show how they appear in the NGSS. Taken together, these themes evoke a technology-centered perspective called ecological modernization that defines sustainability as a set of global problems affecting all humans equally and solvable through the application of science and technology. We argue that students who are taught to think about sustainability from this perspective will be less able to see its ethical and political dimensions and less prepared for the political realities of a pluralist, democratic society that must balance the needs of multiple groups and integrate science with other sources of knowledge to develop contextualized responses to sustainability challenges. One compelling alternative is a systematic collaboration between science educators and social studies educators, in which the complementary pedagogical strengths of both fields are combined to provide realistic and powerful preparation for future sustainability challenges.

AB  - This article follows the culmination of the scientific thought of the neurobiologist Christfried Jakob (1866-1956) during the later part of his career, based on publications from 1930 to 1949, when he was between 64 and 83 years of age. Jakob emphasized the necessity of bridging philosophy to the biological sciences, neurobiology in particular. Thus, we consider him as one of the early protagonists in the emergence of neurophilosophy in the 20th century. The topics that occupied his mind were the foundations for a future philosophy of the brain, and the "neurobiogenetic", "neurodynamic", and "neuropsychogenetic" problems in relation to how consciousness emerges. Jakob's views have many elements in common with great thinkers of philosophy and psychology, including Immanuel Kant, William James, Edmund Husserl, Henri Bergson, Jean Piaget and Willard Quine. A common denominator can also be discerned between Jakob's dynamic approach and certain aspects of cybernetics and neurophenomenology. Jakob propounded the interdisciplinarity of sciences as an indispensable tool for ultimately solving the enigma of consciousness. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - Earth Science and Geography teacher preparation has developed to some degree along different lines, despite sharing many of the same issues, especially with regard to challenges in teacher education. The conference "International Perspectives on Geography and Earth Science Teacher Education 2016" wanted to bring together educators from both sciences from around the world together to move the debate about these challenges forward. From the research presentations and the discussion during and after the conference, several issues emerged: (1) the importance of the two subjects not losing sight of each other; (2) the need to overcome language barriers; (3) the question of standards/objectives for geography teacher education (e.g. with regard to teachers' (P)CK); (4) media used in teacher education (including ways to improve them); (5) ways to improve learners' geography and earth science content knowledge; and (6) strategies to increase teachers' professionalism. We already suggest some specific steps teacher educators in the two fields can take to improve teacher education. Yet, it also became clear that more research and strengthening international collaborations are needed, as well as better communication of the results of these efforts to practitioners.

AB  - Within cross-curricular literacy (CCL) initiatives at colleges and universities, there still remain challenges in preparing and supporting instructors from different disciplinary backgrounds. This small, exploratory study investigates the ways that literacy experiences and disciplinary backgrounds shape the teaching practice of five science writing instructors, three with English/Writing Studies backgrounds, and two with science backgrounds. Findings show that, for instructors in our discipline-linked program, disciplinary background shapes their course goals, their need for cross-disciplinary mentoring, and their levels of confidence in teaching science writing. Reflections for CCL leaders conclude the article.

AB  - The technological advancement and rapid development of artificial intelligence have led to a growing number of studies investigating pedagogical innovations incorporated with emerging technologies in this digital era. An increasing amount of empirical evidence has suggested the potential benefits of incorporating digital technologies and artificial intelligence in various educational contexts, such as the K-12 education, and a change in learning modality in the unprecedented period of COVID-19. In chemical education, various types of emerging technologies, such as eye-tracking techniques, learning analytics, robotics, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR), have seen wide applications and promising prospects. In this paper, a systematic review of emerging technologies adopted in chemical education during this era of digitalization and artificial intelligence is presented. The current study aims to identify the major types of technologies adopted in chemical education and analyze the empirical findings from relevant studies. A total of 45 studies between 2010 and 2021 were analyzed through a literature search in three inter-disciplinary databases: Web of Science, Scopus, and the Educational Information Resource Center. Full-text retrieval and analysis of the included studies were conducted. The present study finds that AR and VR applications were most extensively investigated among the identified types of technologies adopted in chemical education, while the major focus areas were associated with virtual chemistry laboratories, visualization and interaction with chemical structures, and classroom hands-on activities. The evidence presented in this study also indicates the promising applications of artificial intelligence and learning analytics in the analysis of students' feedback and behavior, assessment of students' understanding of chemical concepts, and investigations of students' reasoning and cognitive processes during chemical tasks such as spectral interpretation. Furthermore, areas requiring more research, investigations, potential future applications, as well as pedagogical implications of education for sustainable development will be identified based on the evidence presented in this study. The findings of this study are expected to give insight on the evolving areas of chemical education research and technology-enhanced teaching and learning.

AB  - This study involved using teaching strategies from the ARCS Motivational Model to develop new interdisciplinary curricular modules and ability assessments that combine Atayal culture with information technology. The purpose was to explore whether, through pedagogy based on the ARCS motivational model, indigenous middle-school students had a significant improvement in teamwork, creative thinking, and communication abilities, and whether or not students' interest in information technology and culture was inspired. Research subjects were 17 first-year students in an Atayal Comprehensive Junior-Senior High School in Nan'ao, Yilan County. The research period was 2016-2017, and data was collected from teaching demonstrations, thoughts written down by students, and tests. Research tools include the qualitative written thoughts of the students and a quantitative assessment of the key abilities of teamwork, creative thinking, and communication abilities. There were a total of 33 items. To explore whether there was a significant change in indigenous students' teamwork, creative thinking, and communication abilities, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for statistical analysis of pre-test and post-test results. Research results show that indigenous students performed significantly better in the post-test than in the pre-test with respect to teamwork, creative thinking, and communication. The thoughts students wrote down after class clearly expressed interest in the cross-disciplinary course combining culture and information technology. Therefore, the course using an ARCS motivational model to combine Atayal culture and information technology significantly improved indigenous students' teamwork, creative thinking, and communication abilities.

AB  - Effective instructional materials can be valuable interventions to improve student interest and achievement in science (National Research Council [NRC], 2007); yet, analyses indicate that many science instructional materials and curricula are fragmented, lack coherence, and are not carefully articulated through a sequence of grade levels (AAAS, 2001; Schmidt et al., 2001). In order to improve student achievement in science, school districts need evidence about the efficacy of instructional materials so they can make sound decisions about their science programs. In addition, science education researchers and curriculum developers can benefit from a better understanding of the characteristics of instructional materials and PD that promote student achievement. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of an intervention that consists of research-based multidisciplinary science curriculum materials for high school students and curriculum-based professional development (PD) for teachers using the materials. The study took place in traditional high schools the state of Washington. Approximately half of the schools were in rural settings in central Washington, the other half were in suburban settings in western Washington. The study sample included nearly 4,000 ninth and tenth grade students nested within 18 high schools. The teacher sample within these 18 schools included 54 teachers. Ninth and tenth grade science teachers in nine treatment schools received curriculum materials and seven days of curriculum-based professional development for each of two years. Teachers in nine comparison schools continued to use extant instructional materials and receive extant professional development (i.e., business-as-usual). A cluster-randomized trial design (Raudenbush et al., 2002) was used where schools were randomly assigned to treatment conditions. Findings showed that research-based science instructional materials with supporting curriculum-based PD have a strong positive effect on classroom instruction and a modest but noteworthy effect on student achievement. One figure is appended.

AB  - Climate change is one of the most significant science issues facing humanity; yet, teaching students about climate change is challenging: not only is it multidisciplinary, but also it is contentious and debated in political, social and media forums. Students need to be equipped with an understanding of climate change science to be able to participate in this discourse. The purpose of this study was to examine Western Australian high school students' understanding of climate change and the greenhouse effect, in order to identify their alternative conceptions about climate change science and provide a baseline for more effective teaching. A questionnaire designed to elicit students' understanding and alternative conceptions was completed by 438 Year 10 students (14-15 years old). A further 20 students were interviewed. Results showed that students know different features of both climate change and the greenhouse effect, however not necessarily all of them and the relationships between. Five categories of alternative conceptions were identified. The categories were (1) the greenhouse effect and the ozone layer; (2) types of greenhouse gases; (3) types of radiation; (4) weather and climate and (5) air pollution. These findings provide science educators a basis upon which to develop strategies and curriculum resources to improve their students' understanding and decision-making skills about the socioscientific issue, climate change.

AB  - This article showcases STEM as an interdisciplinary field in which the disciplines strengthen and support each other (not as separate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines). The authors focus on an open-ended, complex problem--water quality--as the primary teaching and learning task. The participants, middle school female students (aged 9-15 years), interacted in an informal educational setting (i.e., Girl Scouts) on a research project investigating river quality following the river's restoration. The community, including Girl Scout participants, leaders, parents, university faculty, graduate students, and others, utilized an action research (AR) approach when interacting with the participants. Methods such as observational field notes, focus groups, and collected artifacts were commonly employed. The authors describe the history of STEM and AR leading to authentic science research projects through eight engineering skills/practices (incorporating science, technology, and mathematics) and showcase participant interactions, implementation, and community engagement in the STEM water quality river project. Findings indicate that informal engineering based projects can serve as opportunities for participants to connect with integrated STEM. Implications include the need for engaging participants in informal authentic science to support traditional school STEM learning and encouraging community engagement in integrated STEM to support traditional K-12 classroom instruction.

AB  - This book contains the full text of papers and posters presented at the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2019), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (WIARS). Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2019 received 547 submissions, from more than 50 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. The conference accepted for presentation 135 submissions (25% acceptance rate), from which, 114 submissions are published in full text in these volumes. The conference also includes a keynote presentation from an internationally distinguished researcher, Prof. Dr. Denise Whitelock, Professor of Technology Enhanced Assessment and Learning, Institute of Educational Technology, The Open University, UK, to whom we express our most gratitude. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. To develop the conference program, we have chosen four main broad-ranging categories, which also covers different interest areas: (1) In TEACHERS AND STUDENTS: Teachers and Staff training and education; Educational quality and standards; Curriculum and Pedagogy; Vocational education and Counseling; Ubiquitous and lifelong learning; Training programs and professional guidance; Teaching and learning relationship; Student affairs (learning, experiences and diversity); Extra-curricular activities; Assessment and measurements in Education. (2) In PROJECTS AND TRENDS: Pedagogic innovations; Challenges and transformations in Education; Technology in teaching and learning; Distance Education and eLearning; Global and sustainable developments for Education; New learning and teaching models; Multicultural and (inter)cultural communications; Inclusive and Special Education; Rural and indigenous Education; Educational projects. (3) In TEACHING AND LEARNING: Critical Thinking; Educational foundations; Research and development methodologies; Early childhood and Primary Education; Secondary Education; Higher Education; Science and technology Education; Literacy, languages and Linguistics (TESL/TEFL); Health Education; Religious Education; Sports Education. (4) In ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES: Educational policy and leadership; Human Resources development; Educational environment; Business, Administration, and Management in Education; Economics in Education; Institutional accreditations and rankings; International Education and Exchange programs; Equity, social justice and social change; Ethics and values; Organizational learning and change, Corporate Education. This is the Volume I of the book "Education and New Developments 2019" and it contains the results of the research and developments conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to promote growth in research methods intimately related to teaching, learning and applications in Education nowadays. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, who will extend our view in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues, by sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This first volume focus in the main areas of TEACHERS AND STUDENTS and PROJECTS AND TRENDS. We would like to express thanks to all the authors and participants, the members of the academic scientific committee, and of course, to our organizing and administration team for making and putting this conference together.

AB  - STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education in the United States faces a host of problems including low recruitment and retention in STEM disciplines, under-representation of multiple segments of the US population, and a host of other issues. These problems are well recognized and a variety of solutions are being implemented by interested parties at multiple points along the STEM education pipeline. Incorporating research into STEM classes is an effective way of enhancing student success in STEM education at the undergraduate level. This paper describes the development and implementation of a research-based laboratory module for community college General Biology I lab students that addresses potential relationships between water pollution and cancer while simultaneously implementing established High Impact Practices. This work is part of a larger effort to recruit and retain the next generation of Earth and Environmental Systems engineering students at the undergraduate level. Our inherently interdisciplinary model, which integrates multiple pedagogical elements, can be adapted for implementation in a wide variety of undergraduate STEM courses. This laboratory module allows students to benefit from authentic research, while gaining skills in gathering scientific data, making connections with global and personal issues, and illustrating relevant discipline concepts.

AB  - Chemistry has become increasingly multidisciplinary. Starting in middle school and high school, however, the different disciplines are taught as distinct subjects and little effort is made to emphasize overlapping concepts. Development of innovative approaches to teaching science through the integration of technology is needed to provide students with a better learning experience that embraces multiple disciplines. Here, we describe an outreach and mentoring program between college and 7th grade students to: (i) encourage 7th grade students to pursue science and engineering degrees; (ii) provide the college students with mentoring experience; and (iii) assist teachers with state-of-the-art educational tools that enhance their teaching.

AB  - This paper describes the development of a taught Master's course in biomedical diagnostics using a novel multi-disciplinary approach. This course, the first of its kind in Ireland, covers the science and technology underlying the development of medical diagnostic devices that detect early markers of diseases such as cancer. The ethical impact of these devices on society, the importance of scientific communication, relevant aspects of business entrepreneurial studies and the commercialisation of medical devices are also covered. The course consists of a mixture of theory, intensive laboratory practicals and independent research. The challenges faced in setting up and running the course are described, as well as some of the novel aspects and may provide valuable insight to those involved in the development of high-level Master's courses.

AB  - Music is recognized as an effective mode of teaching young children but is rarely used in university-level science courses. This article reviews the somewhat limited evidence on whether and how content-rich music might affect college students' understanding of science and offers practical suggestions for incorporating music into courses. Aside from aiding memorization, songs may potentially improve learning by helping students feel relaxed and welcome in stressful settings, engaging students through multiple modes (verbal vs. nonverbal) and modalities (auditory vs. visual vs. kinesthetic) simultaneously, challenging students to integrate and "own" the material through the medium of song lyrics, and increasing students' time on task outside of class through enjoyable listening or songwriting assignments. Students may produce content-rich songs of good quality if given sufficient assistance and encouragement by instructors and peers. The challenges ahead include 1) defining the circumstances in which music is most likely to promote learning and 2) developing rubrics for evaluating the quality of songs. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - The current study presents an evaluation of the laboratory instructional tasks prepared based on innovative teaching approaches (research-inquiry, problem solving, project, argumentation and web-based interdisciplinary learning approaches) designed to enhance science teachers' biotechnology knowledge, awareness and laboratory experiences. The laboratory instructional tasks developed by the researchers aim to improve the laboratory experiences, as well as support the teaching of biotechnology through innovative teaching approaches. For this purpose, in-service training course titled Biotechnology Education Practices was conducted with the voluntary participation of science teachers (n = 17). The current study employed the embedded design. The quantitative part of the embedded design is designed as the single group pretest-posttest model and the qualitative part of it is designed as the case study. The data of the current study were collected through the Biotechnology Awareness Questionnaire, Biotechnology Evaluation Questions, The Laboratory Self-Evaluation form and worksheets. The results obtained from the analyses revealed that the instructional tasks conducted within the context of the Biotechnology Education Practices resulted in significant effects on the science teachers' biotechnology knowledge and awareness and that the innovative teaching approaches were effective in developing the science teachers' laboratory experiences. It would be useful to use laboratory instructional tasks enriched with innovative teaching approaches in teaching biotechnology subjects.

AB  - Health professions education scholarship units (HPESUs) are increasingly becoming a standard for medical schools worldwide without having much information about their value and role in actual educational practices, particularly of those who work in these units, the educational scientists. We conducted a linguistic analysis, called Membership Categorization Analysis, of interviews with leaders of recent curriculum changes to explore how they talk about educational scientists in relation to these processes. The analysis was conducted on previously collected interview data with nine change leaders of major undergraduate medical curriculum change processes in the Netherlands. We analyzed how change leaders categorize HPESUs and educational scientists (use of category terms) and what they say about them (predicates). We noticed two ways of categorizing educational scientists, with observable different predicates. Educational scientists categorized by their first name were suggested to be closer to the change process, more involved in decisional practices and positively described, whereas those described in more generic terms were represented in terms of relatively passive and unspecified activities, were less explicit referenced for their knowledge and expertise and were predominantly factually or negatively described. This study shows an ambiguous portrayal of educational scientists by leaders of major curriculum change processes. Medical schools are challenged to establish medical curricula in consultation with a large, diverse and interdisciplinary stakeholder group. We suggest that it is important to invest in interpersonal relationships to strengthen the internal collaborations and make sure people are aware of each other's existence and roles in the process of curriculum development.

AB  - This book contains the full text of papers and posters presented at the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2021), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (W.I.A.R.S.), that this year had to be transformed into a fully Virtual Conference as a result of the Coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic. Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2021 received 478 submissions, from more than 40 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters and Workshops. The conference accepted for presentation 160 submissions (34% acceptance rate), from which, 151 submissions are published in full text in this book. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. This book contains the results of the research and developments conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to promote growth in research methods intimately related to teaching, learning and applications in Education nowadays. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, who will extend our view in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues, by sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences.

AB  - Grand challenges stress the importance of multi-disciplinary research, a multi-actor approach in examining the current state of affairs and exploring possible solutions, multi-level governance and policy coordination across geographical boundaries and policy areas, and a policy environment for enabling change both in science and technology and in society. The special nature of grand challenges poses certain needs in evaluation practice: (a) the need for learning at the operational, policy and, especially, system level; and (b) the importance of a wider set of impacts and behavioural change. The examination of the usefulness of evaluations as learning tools thus becomes relevant as does the way current evaluation practices address broader impacts and issues such as behavioural additionality. The suitability of existing evaluation contexts in meeting the specific issues posed by the "grand challenges" orientation is also worth examining. The paper argues that learning at the policy and system levels is largely unaddressed while concepts such as behavioural additionality are still underexploited.

AB  - The current school system has an underrepresentation of People of Color teaching science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Presently, there is a lack of data gathering tools to explore the STEM experience of Students of Color. This article focuses on the development of a survey using a Critical Race Theory framework to better understand the impact of race on the STEM education pipeline for underrepresented, racially minoritized (URM) learners. This article will review the survey's development process consisting of (a) creation of initial survey; (b) pilot study using interviews to receive feedback; (c) modifying the survey based on the feedback from the pilot study; and (d) implementation of the revised survey. Ultimately this instrument will support inquiry around racial representation in STEM education.

AB  - Today's healthcare can be characterised by the increasing importance of specialisation that requires cooperation across disciplines and specialities. In view of the number of educational programmes for interdisciplinary cooperation, surprisingly little is known on how learning arises from interdisciplinary work. In order to analyse the learning and teaching practices of interdisciplinary cooperation, a multiple case study research focused on how consults, i.e., doctor-to-doctor consultations between medical doctors from different disciplines were carried out: semi-structured interviews with doctors of all levels of seniority from two hospital sites in Switzerland were conducted. Starting with a priori constructs based on the "methods" underpinning cognitive apprenticeship (CA), the transcribed interviews were analysed according to the principles of qualitative content analysis. The research contributes to three debates: (1) socio-cognitive and situated learning, (2) intra- and interdisciplinary learning in clinical settings, and (3), more generally, to cooperation and problem solving. Patient cases, which necessitate the cooperation of doctors in consults across boundaries of clinical specialisms, trigger intra- as well as interdisciplinary learning and offer numerous and varied opportunities for learning by requesting doctors as well as for on-call doctors, in particular those in residence. The relevance of consults for learning can also be verified from the perspective of CA which is commonly used by experts, albeit in varying forms, degrees of frequency and quality, and valued by learners. Through data analysis a model for collaborative problem-solving and help-seeking was developed which shows the interplay of pedagogical "methods" of CA in informal clinical learning contexts.

AB  - Shared vision is an important process for change projects, serving to amplify success, increase participation, and erode the divide between project leaders and constituents. Yet there are few empirical examinations of the process of building shared vision within academic departments. Using focus groups and participant observation, this study examines shared vision development within 13 large-scale change projects in engineering and computer science higher education. We find that teams of faculty, staff, administrators, and students built shared vision with stakeholders through co-orientation, formational communication, and recognition of stakeholder autonomy. Our results delineate practices for developing shared vision for academic change projects and demonstrate the benefits of inclusive stakeholder empowerment.

AB  - Data science is emerging as a field that is revolutionizing science and industries alike. Work across nearly all domains is becoming more data driven, affecting both the jobs that are available and the skills that are required. As more data and ways of analyzing them become available, more aspects of the economy, society, and daily life will become dependent on data. It is imperative that educators, administrators, and students begin today to consider how to best prepare for and keep pace with this data-driven era of tomorrow. Undergraduate teaching, in particular, offers a critical link in offering more data science exposure to students and expanding the supply of data science talent. "Data Science for Undergraduates: Opportunities and Options" offers a vision for the emerging discipline of data science at the undergraduate level. This report outlines some considerations and approaches for academic institutions and others in the broader data science communities to help guide the ongoing transformation of this field.

AB  - A two-axis solar tracker and its interactive kiosk were designed by an interdisciplinary team of students and faculty. The objective was to develop a publicly accessible kiosk that would facilitate the study of energy usage and production on campus. Tracking is accomplished by an open-loop algorithm, microcontroller, and ham radio rotator. Solar panel output is monitored in real time and displayed to the public with lights and digits that can be read by the casual passersby. While maximum power point tracking is the most accurate means of quantifying the output power of a photovoltaic panel, simplicity and design constraints dictated the use of short-circuit current as a proxy for power. A touchscreen display allows kiosk visitors to compare two solar panels, an automatic tracker that faces the sun, and an identical panel whose elevation and azimuth can be controlled with a virtual joystick. This project was a capstone experience for students in physics/engineering, computer science, and instructional technology. We discuss technical challenges and design choices, as well as the educational goals of the kiosk.

AB  - Electronic textiles, especially those that can be worn (wearable textiles) are gaining traction within the P12 education community. The technology provides hands-on learning that is both exciting and personally relevant, especially for females, who have historically responded positively to aesthetics and textile design. A number of studies have examined the potential of wearable technologies in education but they generally use small samples, mostly engage secondary school students, and are carried out in either formal or informal settings. In contrast, this study utilized a large sample of 808 upper elementary students and involved both in- and out-of-school learning contexts led by formal and informal educators. The present study used a quasi-experimental, prepost design with two groups (treatment and control) to measure the impact of a wearable technology intervention on students' (a) knowledge of circuitry, programming, and engineering design and (b) self-efficacy in making a wearable e-textile product. The three-level multilevel (i.e., children nested within teachers which were nested within schools) ANCOVAs were estimated for each outcome of interest (knowledge of circuitry, programming, engineering design, engineering self-efficacy, and programming self-efficacy). Results indicate that wearable technology's integration of engineering, computing, and aesthetics promises to be an excellent interdisciplinary context to support students' STEM learning and attitudes at the upper elementary level. However, differential results between males and females underscore the need to infuse gender-appropriate pedagogical practices to insure that females develop the needed self-confidence to successfully complete tasks involving these two skill areas.

AB  - This paper reports on a funded collaborative large-scale curriculum innovation and enhancement project undertaken as part of a UK National Higher Education Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) programme. Its aim was to develop undergraduate curricula to teach appropriate skills for professional engineering practice more effectively. Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) led the project with Loughborough and London South Bank Universities as partners. Project advisers included Imperial College London and Coventry University. The four collaborative project objectives were to: develop an approach to interdisciplinary cross-year integration and professional team practice, project management, learning, teaching and assessment; develop cross-year student support systems to aid the above; develop the assessment of professional skills; and evaluate and disseminate the project outcomes to the wider STEM community. The activity allowed partners to trial and test a rounded implementation in each institution involving academic taught material, practical laboratory-based project work, together with an appropriate support structure for operation across a range of undergraduate courses.

AB  - We describe how a team approach that we developed as a mentoring strategy can be used to recruit, advance, and guide students to be more interested in the interdisciplinary field of mathematical biology, and lead to success in undergraduate research in this field. Students are introduced to research in their first semester via lab rotations. Their participation in the research of four faculty members--two from biology and two from mathematics--gives them a first-hand overview of research in quantitative biology and also some initial experience in research itself. However, one of the primary goals of the lab rotation experience is that of developing teams of students and faculty that combine mathematics and statistics with biology and the life sciences, teams that subsequently mentor undergraduate research in genuine interdisciplinary environments. Thus, the team concept serves not only as a means of establishing interdisciplinary research, but also as a means of incorporating new students into existing research efforts that will then track those students into meaningful research of their own. We report how the team concept is used to support undergraduate research in mathematical biology and what types of team-building strategies have worked for us. (Contains 3 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - Interdisciplinary work within higher education has increased significantly over past decades (Amey 2004; Creamer and Lattuca 2005). However, the professional implications of interdisciplinary research and instruction for the faculty members who engage in such academic work remain unclear. This study of science educators who hold appointments in two academic departments begins to address this empirical gap. The outcomes provide insight into the factors that influence the professional lives of these faculty members. The knowledge gained from the study will provide mentors, colleagues, and administrators insight into the challenges facing academics undertaking this work. Further, this research seeks to inform policy makers in regard to how tenure and promotion is determined for jointly appointed faculty in science education and other interdisciplinary fields.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the science teachers' perceptions of and beliefs about integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in the science curriculum. A case study research method was used to determine teachers' perceptions and beliefs of integrated STEM education in the science curriculum. The research was conducted with the participation of ten science teachers who worked in secondary schools located in different regions of Turkey. In this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted for data collection. The data obtained from the study were analyzed using content analysis. During the content analysis process, open and axial coding steps that are based on grounded coding were followed. According to the findings, teachers' perceptions of STEM education knowledge were examined under three categories: STEM education concept knowledge, curriculum knowledge, and STEM education implementation knowledge. In the study, it was determined that most of the teachers considered themselves inadequately prepared for integrated STEM education in the science curriculum. When teachers' beliefs regarding the problems that might be encountered during an integrated STEM education process were examined, it was found that the emphasis was especially on teacher-based problems. Furthermore, teachers believed that integrated STEM education would have positive effects on teachers, students, and science education.

AB  - The present transformation of the university system is conceptualized in terms of such terminologies as "Mode-2 knowledge production" and the "entrepreneurial university." What is remarkable about these analyses is how closely they link the generally accepted requirement of more socially relevant knowledge to the commercialization of university research. This paper critically examines the Mode-1/Mode-2 distinction through a combination of philosophical and empirical analysis. It argues that, from the perspective of actual scientific practice, this Mode-1/Mode-2 distinction and the related transition thesis do not stand closer scrutiny. Theoretical "Mode-1" science shares "Mode-2" features in being also problem-oriented, interventive and transdisciplinary. On the other hand, the empirical case on language technology demonstrates that even in "Mode-2"-like research, undertaken in the "context of application," scientists make a distinction between more difficult scientific problems and those that are considered more applied or commercial. Moreover, the case shows that the need to make such distinctions may even become more acute due to the compromises imposed by the commercialization of research.

AB  - The objective of the article is to reconstruct the mental programs, their cognitive, axiological and connotative structures, and construction on this basis of various modal patterns of social behavior in Russian society. Methodology of the article is based on an interdisciplinary scientific approach making it possible to conceptually disclose the contents of reflexive structures of mental programs that determine modal patterns of social behavior. On the basis of the cognitive construction the authors identify the distinctive features of the liberal pattern, liberal-statist pattern, statist pattern, and conservative-liberal pattern of social behavior in Russian society. It is shown that in modern Russian society, two alternative modal patterns of social behavior can be distinguished: liberal and conservative. However, in real life these patterns are mostly hybrid: statist-liberal, as they include elements of the liberal behavior pattern.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate if we could improve retention by redesigning an online programming course from a gender perspective, while maintaining the focus on preferable and sustainable learning approaches. The study builds on results from an earlier study that investigated the relationship between approaches to learning and course completion and involves 1067 students that responded to the short version of the Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students (ASSIST) in 2010, 2012 and 2013. Three principles for course material design were identified; "gender neutral and non-biased messages," "emphasize the interdisciplinary approach" and "link to everyday examples." Responses to ASSIST were analysed in relation to performed changes in the course literature from a gender perspective. The probability to complete the course increased with 7% points for all students, in particular for men, and decreased for students with a high score in surface approach to learning, especially among women.

AB  - According to the World Economic Forum (2016), "more than one third (36%) of all jobs across all industries" (p.21) need problem-solving as a key skill. Trilling and Fadel (2009) noted the shift from industrial to knowledge-based economies, requiring students not only to possess content knowledge but also have skills that enable them to make sense of information and synthesise useful products. Students in this century would certainly be facing more complex and multifaceted problems as well. 21st century problems can include those of a biological nature, such as persistent and complex health disorders such as diabetes mellitus. Combating diabetes requires an understanding of biology (particularly homeostasis and hormones), a knowledge of biotechnology tools that can measure blood glucose concentration, engineering potential solutions that address or alleviate the problems associated with diabetes and using mathematics to compute personalised dosages of the patient's medication. As such, students need to be able to integrate knowledge from different disciplines to synthesise solutions to these complex, novel, and often persistent problems. Yet there have been few STEM activities focusing on problems of a biological nature. In light of this the authors designed a STEM task that is centred on a problem related to biology and hence requires the application of biological referent-centred knowledge to devise a solution to a complex problem related to pill coating. The integrated STEM biological problem was aimed to (1) expose students to inter-disciplinary problem-solving; and (2) shift the learning of biological content towards solving problems rather than in neat categories or topics as one would find in a textbook.

AB  - Several traditional chemistry lab experiences were replaced with a problem-based learning (PBL) experience in a university general education, conceptual chemistry course. Students worked in small groups on an authentic chemistry problem in which each student played a different role (Scientist, Engineering, Marketing Manager, Safety Officer, or Secretary). Mid-semester, the pandemic forced the course online. Q methodology [Q] was used to determine the divergent viewpoints that existed amongst the students regarding their PBL experience. Each student provided their view by sorting related statements into a grid. Three divergent viewpoints emerged from the analyses: two viewpoints were positive about the PBL experience (Motivated learners and Committed to my group) and one was negative (Negative experience due to group dynamics). Descriptions of these views and implications are discussed.

AB  - This article explores the development of the UK Government's Sustainable Schools Initiative and examines the contribution that science teaching can make to this. Drawing on recent research in schools and on development work in initial teacher education, the article argues that, in the absence of policy that enables schools to bring subject areas together, schools will have to take responsibility for this themselves. Schools should develop new ways of thinking about the focus and nature of science education, given the scope that this has for helping young people understand their world and what they can contribute to making it more sustainable.

AB  - Basic education in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) seems to be characterized by lecture methods of instruction, a lack of interdisciplinary approaches and a disconnection with local community problems. During 2008, a "My Community, Our Earth" (MyCOE) workshop was organized in the MENA region and involved teachers of geography, math and science. It aimed to promote and support the use of geographic methods and technologies, including Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS), regarding sustainable development topics as a way to improve primary and secondary teaching and learning through an interdisciplinary approach and connection to local issues. These subjects were integrated to a perspective based on spatial thinking, spatial analysis, active learning and problem solving on a variety of regional and local issues. This article explores the impact that the MyCOE workshop may have on participants' learning. Preworkshop and postworkshop questionnaires were administered, and the analysis of qualitative and quantitative data shows that the respondents' expertise was reinforced and that they learned to use geographic technologies. In addition, the MyCOE workshop resulted in the development of a more concrete vision among participants of what basic math and science education could be in Arab nations, by using geographic learning as a framework for integrated education.

AB  - This book explores the connections made in and through arts-based educational research through four themes: socially engaged connections, cultural connections, personal and pedagogical connections, and making connections during the COVID-19 pandemic. It emerges from the 3rd bi-annual 2020 Artful Inquiry Research Group symposium on the theme of "connections". The symposium brought together artists, community members, teachers, students, and researchers through a virtual platform to examine the way(s) in which the arts can help connect people, ideas, and spaces/places in a pandemic reality. Art plays a predominant role in each chapter as authors weave their research and art-based understandings together. This book is a valuable teaching resource for undergraduate and postgraduate courses in teaching, anthropology, digital ethnography, autoethnography, cultural studies, and communications. It is of interest to higher education students, academic researchers, and teachers exploring arts-based methodologies in the fields of creative practice and creativity studies, communications, critical studies, sociology, sciences, teacher education, and the arts.

AB  - In the context of the increasing migration into Germany that has taken place in recent years and German efforts to establish an inclusive school system, which enables learners from different religious, ethnic, language and social backgrounds with and without disabilities to participate, religious education has become a key topic for interdisciplinary discourse between theology, philosophy, and pedagogy in German schools. The following questions are of special interest: How can we manage diversity in inclusive classroom settings in general, and specifically: how can we do so with regard to worldview diversity? Does worldview diversity in schools exist, and if so, how can we recognize it in its plurality and complexity? How can we acknowledge different worldviews in the context of a changing inclusive school system? In this article, we would like to present the theoretical foundation, the research setting and the first findings of our ongoing pilot studies of worldview education at an inclusive German school. The experiments are part of a larger project context that is also described. The case study presented in this article, in which innovative language and machine learning technology was used for data analysis, illustrates the potential of inclusive methods and didactic concepts such as Universal Design for Learning, Learning in the Presence of the Other, and Reflexive Inclusion for inclusive worldview education in the context of a religiously pluralized and secularized society.

AB  - The authors sought to better approximate the practice of "real" science in our classrooms by having students study a newly built storm-water remediation wetland on campus. The wetland was meant to gather and clean storm water running off of student parking lots--thus students had ownership in the problem and potential solution. Participating faculty members in the biology, chemistry, geography, and geology departments created learning modules to introduce students to industry-standard techniques, scientific research skills, and the structure and functioning of wetlands. Most modules had opportunities for student-driven inquiry; for instance, students identified what aspects of the wetland were most important and poorly known and designed projects to fill those data gaps. Students, faculty, and a keynote speaker convened yearly at a Wetland Forum to exchange data and experiences. The project was assessed with pre/post-testing of student perceptions and learning outcomes. (Contains 2 figures and 5 tables.)

AB  - The goal of this project, one of the proposals of the EPS@ISEP Spring 2014, was to develop an Aquaponics System. Over recent years Aquaponics systems have received increased attention since they contribute to reduce the strain on resources within 1st and 3rd world countries. Aquaponics is the combination of Hydroponics and Aquaculture, mimicking a natural environment in order to successfully apply and enhance the understanding of natural cycles within an indoor process. Using this knowledge of natural cycles, it was possible to create a system with capabilities similar to that of a natural environment with the support of electronics, enhancing the overall efficiency of the system. The multinational team involved in the development of this system was composed of five students from five countries and fields of study. This paper describes their solution, including the overall design, the technology involved and the benefits it can bring to the current market. The team was able to design and render the Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings of the prototype, assemble all components, successfully test the electronics and comply with the budget. Furthermore, the designed solution was supported by a product sustainability study and included a specific marketing plan. Last but not least, the students enrolled in this project obtained new multidisciplinary knowledge and increased their team work and cross-cultural communication skills.

AB  - A teacher network was formed at an Australian university in order to better promote interdisciplinary student learning on the complex social-environmental problem of climate change. Rather than leaving it to students to piece together disciplinary responses, eight teaching academics collaborated on the task of exposing students to different types of knowledge in a way that was more than the summing of disciplinary parts. With a part-time network facilitator providing cohesion, network members were able to teach into each other's classes, and share material and student activities across a range of units that included business, zoology, marine science, geography and education. Participants reported that the most positive aspects of the project were the collegiality and support for teaching innovation provided by peers. However, participants also reported being time-poor and overworked. Maintaining the collaboration beyond the initial one year project proved difficult because without funding for the network facilitator, participants were unable to dedicate the time required to meet and collaborate on shared activities. In order to strengthen teacher collaboration in a university whose administrative structures are predominantly discipline-based, there is need for recognition of the benefits of interdisciplinary learning to be matched by recognition of the need for financial and other resources to support collaborative teaching initiatives.

AB  - Students not familiar with chemistry tend to misinterpret analytical chemistry as some kind of the sorcery where analytical chemists working as modern wizards handle magical black boxes able to provide fascinating results. However, this approach is evidently improper and misleading. Therefore, the position of modern analytical chemistry among sciences and in the contemporary world is discussed. Its interdisciplinary character and the necessity of the collaboration between analytical chemists and other experts in order to effectively solve the actual problems of the human society and the environment are emphasized. The importance of the analytical method validation in order to obtain the accurate and precise results is highlighted. The invalid results are not only useless; they can often be even fatal (e.g., in clinical laboratories). The curriculum of analytical chemistry at schools and universities is discussed. It is referred to be much broader than traditional equilibrium chemistry coupled with a simple description of individual analytical methods. Actually, the schooling of analytical chemistry should closely connect theory and practice.

AB  - This chapter aims to seek insight into engagement in context, conceived through Productive Disciplinary Engagement (PDE), which can be perceived as a condition for sustained disciplinary and interdisciplinary interest and motivation. Despite ongoing trends in the design and implementation of enriched learning environments that are expected to boost effective use of material and digital tools along with new sources of information, the empirical research on their motivational and emotional consequences is still in its infancy. These environments challenge, cognitively as well as motivationally, emotionally, and socially, both students and teachers alike. Keeping in mind the challenging times for future learning and work-life, engagement and motivation are discussed with a focus on science disciplines. In these fields, there is a strong call for proficient skills in collaborative team learning, problem-solving, and collective knowledge creation in anticipation of an uncertain, challenging future. Knowledge-intensive work and knowledge demands are escalating along with fast technological development, and simultaneously tasks that demand new, not yet even existing and partly unpredicted knowledge and expertise are increasing. In addition, knowledge and expertise are progressively more distributed, with new knowledge, products and innovations being created in collaboration that crosses disciplinary borders. In this chapter, three case illustrations in different science fields and learning contexts provide empirical evidence for the discussion on the learned lessons from these illustrated studies designed to support PDE, and the potential significance of PDE for productive collaboration, sustained disciplinary interest, and motivation given later development of adaptive expertise.

AB  - In demanding innovation areas such as eHealth, the primary emphasis is easily placed on the product and process quality aspects in the design phase. Customer quality may receive adequate attention when the target audience is well-defined. But if the multidimensional evaluative focus does not get enough space until the implementation phase, this means a delay. The study examines how the adoption and diffusion processes of educational eHealth innovations could be enhanced from the viewpoint of design. Explorative, critical analysis of the multidisciplinary literature with a pragmatic approach serves this aim. The prerequisites identified in general adoption models and theories refer to several quality aspects. When designers understand the meaning of versatile quality framing in the early design phase, this may ease the adoption processes of eHealth. Questioning that focuses on the quality of eHealth innovations rather than on adaptation problems is more fruitful from the viewpoint of design. In demanding development areas, the maturation processes of products may be laborious, and therefore, rapid diffusion processes are not always possible and not even useful if these occur at the expense of quality.

The resultant presentation was intended to engage students in discussing historical and contemporary biology education, as well as some of the intricacies of seed biology. Comparisons between the usefulness and scope of various seed identification resources, both online and in print, were made.

AB  - Objective: This article 1) provides an overview of formal Health Sciences Teaching Scholars Programs as presented in medical education literature and 2) presents information about an innovative multidiscipline Teaching Scholars Program. Method: Health Sciences Teaching Scholars Programs and similar programs were reviewed in the medical education literature to identify similar and dissimilar characteristics. The WVU Teaching Scholars Program highlighted in this article is presented with a discussion of goals, objectives, target audiences, course length, session frequency, program topics, learning methods, and assessments of the programs. A summary of the WVU Teaching Scholars Program and two Teaching Scholars Programs at McGill University and the University of Toronto were presented at the Association for American Medical Colleges (AAMC) annual meeting in 2006 for input from the general medical education audience. Results: Comparisons of Health Sciences Teaching Scholars Programs reveal that successful programs are uniquely shaped by their educational environments. Scholars report that they value learning new teaching methods and improving their educational careers. Conclusion: Teaching Scholars Programs are valuable for the development of enhancing both teaching and scholarship in Health Sciences Programs and must adapt to the uniqueness of their respective educational environments and must continue to nurture scholars beyond graduation.

AB  - STEM, or the integration of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, has rapidly become a dominant discourse in political, economic and educational spheres. In the U.S., the STEM movement has been boosted by global economic-based competition and associated fears, in terms of STEM graduates, when compared with other nations. However, many critiques question the nature and goals of this competition, as well as, the possibilities to improve STEM talents through the current dominant conceptualizations and practices of STEM education. In addition, the apparent lack of significant and coherent embracement of (and sometimes silence about) socioscientific and socio-political issues and perspectives renders STEM education incapable of preparing learners for active citizenships. Building on these critiques, I argue that these problems are possible consequences of STEM as a construct of power. My arguments are based on Lyotard's conceptions of knowledge in postmodern society (as reported in The postmodern condition: A report on knowledge, University Press, Manchester, 1984), which I use to analyze some aspects of the STEM educational movement. Throughout the paper, I explore the construction of STEM education within competitive frames that place prime value on high performativity. There seem to be two characteristics of current STEM education that support performativity; these are an increased focus on technological and engineering designs, and a tendency for interdisciplinary education. At the same time, the eagerness for performativity and competition seems to drag STEM education into selectiveness, thereby jeopardizing its possible benefits. Recommendations are also discussed.

AB  - Science Without Borders is a unique interdisciplinary science course that uses group and active-learning strategies and is in high demand among nonscience majors at a masters-level university. Registrar data showed that nonscience majors were far more likely to choose this course compared with other, discipline-based science courses. In an investigation of course catalogs of 60 randomly selected institutions of higher learning, only 5% offered a similar course. In this paper, we describe the course's unique structure and successful administration. In addition, pre- and postcourse surveys were administered to over 200 students in 10 different sections over the course of one academic year. These data showed that students demonstrated modest increases in science competency, but perceptions of science were unchanged. (Contains 3 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - Traditional teacher professional development (PD) programs frequently lack sufficient face-to-face preparation time to adequately support the implementation of evidence-based pedagogical strategies in classrooms, with teachers citing insufficient preparedness and training time for new methods. To investigate potentials for online PD methods to effectively address these issues, while increasing sustainability, this study examined teachers in Title-I elementary schools spanning multiple school districts participating in a large-scale online PD certificate program preparing teachers over 10 instructional weeks to implement Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) (S)cience, (T)echnology, (E)ngineering, (A)rts, (M)ath (STEAM) curricular instruction with goals of increasing teachers' science content knowledge, self-efficacy to implement STEAM instruction, and STEAM teaching perceptions. Paired sample t-tests indicate teachers' life science content knowledge, self-efficacy, and STEAM perceptions increased significantly after completing the online PD. Multiple regression analyses identified teachers' science content knowledge and STEAM perceptions as statistically significant predictors of teachers' self-efficacy to implement STEAM instructional strategies. Teachers' posttest course evaluations were gleaned, highlighting three emergent themes: learning experience design, modality, and online teacher collaboration. Utilizing a mixed method approach, these qualitative insights corroborated the quantitative trends, describing how specific aspects of the pedagogical learning experience design (LXD) framework operationalized in the online course fostered a practitioner development learning environment, focused on supporting teachers' learning needs. Results suggest practical design implications for sustainably increasing the efficacy of PD through online teacher training developed in conjunction with LXD models for iterative improvement and design of high-quality online instructional PD programs.

AB  - Bioinformatics is a relatively new interdisciplinary field that integrates computer science, mathematics, biology, and information technology to manage, analyze, and understand biological, biochemical and biophysical information. We present our experience in teaching an interdisciplinary course, Introduction to Bioinformatics, which was developed and taught by an interdisciplinary team of computer science and biology faculty. To integrate the "Ethics, Computing, and Genomics" component into the course curriculum, collaboration with an English faculty member was established. The course was designed as an upper-level elective for computer information systems and computer science majors and was open as a science elective for all science majors and for chemical engineering majors. We discuss the course curriculum, and a way to integrate the Python programming language in the UNIX environment will be presented. The integration of bioinformatics algorithms into the course curriculum will be emphasized.

AB  - Articles from the National Science Teacher Association (NSTA) publications were analyzed to investigate resources available for teachers who want to implement interdisciplinary approaches into the science classroom. All articles in each journal from 2004 through 2008 were read an analyzed; approximately 13% of Science & Children (elementary), 21% of Science Scope (middle), and 17% of The Science Teacher (high school) articles met the interdisciplinary approach criteria. Results show that overall, reading, writing, art, and technology are the subjects most commonly integrated into science. Surprisingly, math is rarely discussed across all school levels. Comparing the articles across different school levels, Science Scope articles have the highest number of integrated articles, whereas The Science Teacher had the fewest number of integrated articles.

AB  - In view of the complex problems of this age, the question of the socio-ethical dimension of science acquires particular importance. We approach this matter from a philosophical and sociological standpoint, looking at such focal concerns as the motivation, purposes and methods of scientific activity, the ambivalence of scientific research and the concomitant risks, and the conflict between research freedom and external socio-political intervention. We then point out the impediments to the effectiveness of cross-disciplinary or broader meetings for addressing these complex problems and managing the associated risks, given the difficulty in communication between experts in different fields and non-experts, difficulties that education is challenged to help resolve. We find that the social necessity of informed decision-making on the basis of cross-disciplinary collaboration is reflected in the newer curricula, such as that of Greece, in aims like the acquisition of cross-subject knowledge and skills, and the ability to make decisions on controversial issues involving value conflicts. The interest and the reflections of the science education community in these matters increase its--traditionally limited--contribution to the theoretical debate on education and, by extension, the value of science education in the education system.

AB  - The social sciences rely on assumptions of a unified self for their explanatory logics. Recent work in the new multidisciplinary field of social neuroscience challenges precisely this unproblematic character of the subjective self as basic, well-defined entity. If disciplinary self-insulation is deemed unacceptable, the philosophical challenge arises of systematically bringing together neurological, psychological, sociological, and anthropological dimensions of analysis in one framework such as dynamic systems theory; and of finding bridging concepts such as memory, social cognition, and cultural scripts that can facilitate the cross disciplinary study of the reflexive self. Relying on the systemic philosophy of science developed by Mario Bunge, this paper takes some steps in this direction.

AB  - Multiple reports highlight the increasingly quantitative nature of biological research and the need to innovate means to ensure that students acquire quantitative skills. We present a tool to support such innovation. The Biological Science Quantitative Reasoning Exam (BioSQuaRE) is an assessment instrument designed to measure the quantitative skills of undergraduate students within a biological context. The instrument was developed by an interdisciplinary team of educators and aligns with skills included in national reports such as "BIO2010, Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians," and "Vision and Change." Undergraduate biology educators also confirmed the importance of items included in the instrument. The current version of the BioSQuaRE was developed through an iterative process using data from students at 12 postsecondary institutions. A psychometric analysis of these data provides multiple lines of evidence for the validity of inferences made using the instrument. Our results suggest that the BioSQuaRE will prove useful to faculty and departments interested in helping students acquire the quantitative competencies they need to successfully pursue biology, and useful to biology students by communicating the importance of quantitative skills. We invite educators to use the BioSQuaRE at their own institutions.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine whether Socioscientific Issues (SSI) based learning environments affect university students' epistemological understanding of scientific inquiry differently from traditional science educational contexts. We identify and compare conceptions of scientific inquiry of students participating in an interdisciplinary, SSI-focused undergraduate human biology major (SSI) and those participating in a traditional biology major (BIO). Forty-five SSI students and 50 BIO students completed an open-ended questionnaire examining their understanding of scientific inquiry. Eight general themes including approximately 60 subthemes emerged from questionnaire responses, and the numbers of students including each subtheme in their responses were statistically compared between groups. A subset of students participated in interviews, which were used to validate and triangulate questionnaire data and probe students' understanding of scientific inquiry in relation to their majors. We found that both groups provided very similar responses, differing significantly in only five subthemes. Results indicated that both groups held generally adequate understandings of inquiry, but also a number of misconceptions. Small differences between groups supported by both questionnaires and interviews suggest that the SSI context contributed to nuanced understandings, such as a more interdisciplinary and problem-centered conception of scientific inquiry. Implications for teaching and research are discussed.

AB  - The purposes of this qualitative case study were to describe the design and the development of a maker-centered learning environment and curriculum by an interdisciplinary team, and to explore how an after-school program that incorporated Maker education and scientific argumentation influenced middle school youths' attitudes toward science in the Midwestern USA. The researchers conducted pre- and post-interviews with six students from non-dominant backgrounds and the teacher, and also administered attitudinal surveys to the six students at two time points (pre/post). Additionally, the researchers video-recorded each after-school session, observed the level of student participation in each activity, and examined student artifacts. At the end of the program, the researchers administered a program survey to the six students. The findings revealed a number of themes. This after-school program eased the tension from the formal science learning with the playful qualities of Making activities and developed the students' practice of social negotiation, which sustained their liking of science. The Making and scientific argumentation activities provided an opportunity to contextualize STEM concepts and practices, which allowed the students to value science by re-affirming as well as expanding their career choices. The Making and scientific argumentation activities helped boost confidence that, up to that point, had been decreasing in formal science learning contexts. The findings speak to the need for future studies that investigate pedagogy issues in Making after-school programs and also examine equity issues in the opportunities for non-dominant youth to participate in these programs.

AB  - The relevance of the topic is due to the enhancing role of emotional intelligence in second language learning. The article aims to substantiate that emotional intelligence (EI) strengthens training quality of future professionals, gives it an emotional color, and thereby increases a variety of intellectual skills. The leading methodical approaches as analyses of electronic library documents and other scientific sources, empirical and experimental data, method of involved observation enabled to identify several parameters for creating a favorable emotional climate in the process of second language learning. The authors determine a set of conditions necessary for the formation of emotional intelligence, define and actualize obligatory interdisciplinary connections, which are expressed in the co-architecture of curricula, educational resources of the university faculty and in the choice of training and educational technology, as well as single out the prerequisites for emotional intelligence. Article is of interest to researchers and university professors dealing with Second Language Learning.

AB  - Several previous studies have investigated the use of questions to facilitate interactions in academic lectures in tertiary education. However, the issue of how disciplinary cultures influence the patterns of questions in lectures has received little attention. Therefore, this study aims to examine the interdisciplinary differences in professors' use of questions in terms of both their forms and functions. The corpus used in this study consists of 15 small-class lectures from three academic divisions: Humanities & Arts (HA), Social Sciences & Education (SS) and Physical Sciences & Engineering (PS). These data are a subset of the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English (MICASE). Previous studies on academic spoken English have reported that, compared with other contextual factors, the disciplinary culture seems to exert a more critical influence on the use of various linguistic features. However, the results of this study show far more similarities than differences across different disciplines. Based on the major findings pertaining to the use of question forms and functions across the three divisions, it is suggested that for questions in academic lectures at the tertiary level, the influence of genre seems to outweigh that of disciplinary culture.

AB  - Present paper aims to give an insight in the field of Mechatronics, specifically its standard of education in India. We have investigated this field right from its origin. We have analyzed how it expanded as a proper discipline of engineering and in which direction the development in this field is going now and, at the same time, its status of education in India and where we are in addressing the industry's need both in terms of quality and quantity of students. We have also assessed why Mechatronics is an essential branch considering its multi-disciplinary nature. The point is that it holds blatant importance for time to come. Life's most complicated problems cannot be addressed by the knowledge of only one engineering science. In today's world we need professionals who are "good jack(s) of all trades and master(s) of one" changing the old saying. For implementing this edited saying students will need to address real-world problems, so laboratory-based learning should be even more emphasized in this branch. Consequently, we have also looked on the laboratory works that are included in these courses, considering what aspects should be covered in them. Skillsets required by students such as implementation of hardware, coding, system modeling have been also discussed. Future prospects in this discipline have also been explored. The epilogue consists in recommendations to educational institutions based on our findings.

AB  - The higher education regulation process in Europe, known as the Bologna Process, has involved many changes, mainly in relation to methodology and assessment. The paper given below relates to implementing the new EU study plans into the Teacher Training College of Vitoria-Gasteiz; it is the first interdisciplinary paper written involving teaching staff and related to the Teaching Profession module, the first contained in the structure of the new plans. The coordination of teaching staff is one of the main lines of work in the Bologna Process, which is also essential to develop the right skills and maximise the role of students as an active learning component. The use of active, interdisciplinary methodologies has opened up a new dimension in universities, requiring the elimination of the once componential, individual structure, making us look for new areas of exchange that make it possible for students' training to be developed jointly.

AB  - As the United States strives to achieve energy independence, students need to be literate about energy and environmental issues. In this article, the authors present a lesson about the nation's electricity resources that is part 1 of a free, comprehensive unit on coal and energy that is available online (http://tinyurl.com/coalenergyunit). The comprehensive unit, which was developed by graduate students supported by the Transforming Earth System Science Education project at Penn State University, contains inquiry-based lessons designed to deepen students' understanding of key Earth-science issues. Data on electricity-generation resources in the United States, including both renewable and nonrenewable types, are highlighted within the lesson of part 1. Part 2 of the comprehensive unit includes lessons that address more detail about coal. In both parts of the unit, students learn fundamental information about the development and use of domestic energy sources. The full lesson for part 1 is included here, but both parts of the comprehensive unit are also described. Completion of all or part of the unit will provide an interdisciplinary look at the nation's energy resources. (Contains 4 figures and 1 online resource.)

AB  - Teachers' knowledge of literacy has gained considerable interest over the last three decades, largely with a focus on the basic language constructs of phonological awareness and phonics. Fewer studies, however, have focused on spelling. Given the close relationship between reading and spelling and the necessity of an explicit understanding of the phonological, orthographic, and morphological patterns of English spelling in the science of teaching reading, the current study examines educators' knowledge of English spelling. Specifically, this pilot investigation focuses on those who are teaching the teachers--teacher educators from multiple institutions throughout the United States, who completed a survey assessing their knowledge and understanding of the phonological, orthographic, and morphological aspects of English spelling. Moreover, the survey assessed the 85 teacher educators' self-efficacy in teaching spelling and their philosophical stance on spelling instruction. Findings indicate that the teacher educators feel they were not prepared to teach spelling, although they believed that some of the pivotal characteristics of spelling (i.e., morphological awareness and alphabetic principle) are important in teaching spelling. Additionally, while teacher educators were able to determine some of the correct spelling patterns, many spelling patterns posed problems for them. Lastly, teacher educators overall lacked knowledge concerning spelling for diverse learners. Research and practice implications for teacher education and preparation are discussed.

AB  - To help undergraduates make connections among disciplines so they are able to approach, evaluate, and contribute to the solutions of important global problems, our campus has been focused on interdisciplinary research and education opportunities across the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. This paper describes the mobilization, planning, and implementation of a first-year interdisciplinary course for STEM majors that integrates key concepts found in traditional first-semester biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics courses. This team-taught course, Integrated Quantitative Science (IQS), is half of a first-year student's schedule in both semesters and is composed of a double lecture and a weekly lab and workshop. Features of this first-year course, including themes and concepts covered each semester, some of the materials developed, lessons learned, challenges, and preliminary measures of success are described.

AB  - How can museums and other informal learning institutions cultivate greater civic engagement among the visiting public around important social issues? This case study of the National Network of Ocean and Climate Change Interpreters' (NNOCCI) professional learning community illustrates how insights from the social sciences can be productively integrated into existing museum interpretation practice. NNOCCI partnered with social scientists at the FrameWorks Institute to strengthen interpreters' capacity to improve museum climate literacy efforts through Strategic Frame Analysis™, an approach to communications research and practice that identifies how the public's deeply held worldviews impact civic participation. Key insights from FrameWorks' original research on the topics of climate change and oceans formed the content of training curriculum. Based on feedback from pilot participants, an interactive pedagogy suited to the museum education context was developed and expanded to reach 150 informal science education institutions through 2015.

AB  - This paper describes a multidisciplinary teaching program, designed to provide students with the broad knowledge and skills required to practice product development in robotics and mechatronics. The curriculum was designed to prepare students for the senior capstone design project, in which they design and build a working mechatronic/robotic system. It consists of a basic program in mechanical engineering, augmented with courses and laboratories in electronics, microprocessors, control, and computer programming. The early introduction of the specialty courses and the ample hands-on experience offered in the accompanying laboratories allows students to gain intuitive understanding of concepts that are usually foreign to mechanical engineers. The capstone design project attracts students to the program and serves as a beacon for the entire program. The program is now in its 11th year, receiving positive feedback from students and graduates.

AB  - Nanoscale science and engineering (NSE) and nanotechnology are emerging fields that have captured the attention of scientists and engineers, as well as mainstream media. However, the general public is relatively unaware of NSE, and schools (both K-12 and undergraduate institutions) rarely include nanotechnology as part of their curriculum. To help fill this gap in public and student understanding and to engage a broad base of learners, a suite of interdisciplinary activities connecting nanotechnology and stained glass artistry was created. The suite of activities has been successfully adapted for use in a wide range of educational settings (e.g., museums, K-12 classrooms, outreach events) for diverse audiences (e.g., children, high school students, members of the general public) to achieve a range of learning objectives.

AB  - As science teachers continue preparing for implementation of the "Next Generation Science Standards," one recommendation is to use computer programming as a promising context to efficiently integrate science and engineering. In this article, a interdisciplinary team of educational researchers and computer scientists describe how to use programming as one way to teach engineering design using tasks like creating a digital story to describe science phenomena or a "how-to" animation that demonstrates how to replicate a science experiment or activity in a fourth-grade classroom. In the activity, students used the Scratch programming language to create programs about science phenomena and science activities by using the engineering design stages of defining problems, developing solutions, and optimizing solutions.

AB  - Teaching children scientific vocabulary is an important part of science education and should be carefully considered when planning units of work so that children can understand new words and apply them to their learning (Sewell, 2018). This view is echoed in the aims of the National Curriculum in England, which states that pupils should be able to describe associated processes and key characteristics in common language, and should also be familiar with, and use, technical terminology accurately and precisely (DfE, 2013). How and when science vocabulary is taught can be a dilemma as there is much to cover in the science curriculum. There is, therefore, merit in considering how English lessons can be used to develop science language. Children only retain words if they are shown them embedded in meaningful texts and given opportunities to use them in discussion, debates and writing (Snow, 2010). Science can provide such a meaningful context in English lessons. In addition, Ward and Roden (2016) maintain that children find writing conclusions easier if they have developed enough scientific vocabulary to explain and interpret their findings. This article provides examples of how meaningful links can be made between science and English when teaching a unit of work on living things and their environments.

AB  - The number of students who learn English as a second language (ESL) in U.S. schools has grown significantly in the past decade. This segment of the student population increased by 56% between the 1994-95 and 2004-05 school years (NCLR 2007). As the ESL student population increases, many science teachers struggle to tailor instructional materials, resources, and teaching strategies to facilitate ESL student learning. With this issue in mind, the authors examine the challenges ESL students experience in learning science and provide a lesson plan and assessment to overcome the obstacles ESL students face in the science classroom. The authors then summarize teaching strategies effective for ESL students' science learning based on research findings and their teaching experiences. (Contains 1 figure and 2 activity worksheets.)

AB  - The goal of this research is to provide a rich set of connections between two fields: (i) Nanoscale science and technology (NST) and (ii) topics from a common middle school physics curriculum. NST is emerging as one of the most promising new fields of the 21st century, which is one of the many arguments for including NST topics in secondary science education. A specially designed guided discourse with NST scientists was used to produce a map of connections between the two fields. During the discourse, the scientists were presented with two sets of concepts using a visual board and were asked to find connections between them. All suggested connections and the corresponding context offered by the scientists were arranged and presented as a rich set of connections. For example, (i) the NST concept of characterization methods is connected to mechanical forces and can be explained using the example of an atomic force microscope; (ii) the NST concept of size-dependent properties was connected to 7th grade inquiry skills by explaining the size dependence of accuracy, errors, and defects. This set of connections was validated by an experienced middle school science teacher in an open discussion regarding teachers adopting and implementing the resulting insertion points for the curriculum. This resulting set of connections can be used to enrich the curriculum within the NST field. It also provides a perspective on scientists' views regarding insertion of contemporary NST topics into physics middle school education.

AB  - We present an inquiry-based, aquatic science professional development (PD) for upper-elementary, middle, and high school teachers and examine changes in student outcomes in light of participating teachers' characteristics and the grade band of the students. Our study lends support to the assertion that inquiry- and content-focused PD, paired with classroom implementation, can effectively improve student learning. Our findings indicate that students improved in their nature of science (NOS) and aquatic science content knowledge and that these changes depended in some ways on the participating teachers' characteristics and adherence to the program. The students' improvements were amplified when their teachers adhered more closely to the PD activities during their classroom implementation. The teachers' previous science PD experience and pre-PD understanding of inquiry-based teaching also explained some of the variability in student growth. In both NOS and content, students of teachers with less prior science-PD experience benefited more. Grade band also explained variation in student outcomes through interactions with teacher-characteristic variables. In high school, students of teachers with lower pre-PD inquiry knowledge appeared to learn more about NOS. Our results suggest that inquiry and content training through PD may minimize disparities in teaching due to inexperience and lack of expertise. Our study also demonstrates the value of PD that teaches a flexible approach to inquiry and focuses on underrepresented, interdisciplinary content areas, like aquatic science.

AB  - The goal of this study was to develop an instrument for assessing grade 10 and 11 student's levels of scientific literacy in the areas of problem solving and decision making. In concentrating on determining the scientific literacy of gymnasium level students, it was taken as a first; previous international studies like PISA have focused on ninth grade students. The study used four interdisciplinary situations in a personal, social and global context, taken from everyday life, and answers were expected at higher levels of scientific thinking. In addition, student's opinions were sought about their interest related to the kind of instruments used, with the intention of considering their opinions if later modifying the instrument. The sample (N = 62) was composed of 10 and 11 grade students in two schools. Results indicated that it is possible to develop an instrument for dividing students' responses between levels of scientific literacy, although most students responded at the functional level with very few at the multidimensional level and this despite the fact that the questions were developed to assess higher levels of scientific literacy. In the students' opinion, the more interesting situations were those in a personal and social context. Students justified this by answering that their capability to solve problems and make decisions by utilizing science knowledge and skills was best in such situations. In reality, they still operated at a functional level as indicated by their responses. (Contains 6 tables.)

AB  - This book contains a compilation of papers presented at the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2018), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (WIARS). Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2018 received 624 submissions, from more than 50 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. The conference accepted for presentation 168 submissions (27% acceptance rate). The conference also includes two keynote presentations from internationally distinguished researchers, Prof. Dr. Zoltán Rónay (Ph.D, Associate Professor) Research Group for Higher Education and Innovation, Institute of Education, Faculty of Education and Psychology, Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary, and Prof. Dr. Gyöngyi Bujdosó (PhD, Senior lecturer) Faculty of Informatics, University of Debrecen, Hungary, to whom we express our most gratitude. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. To develop the conference program, we have chosen four main broad-ranging categories, which also covers different interest areas: (1) In TEACHERS AND STUDENTS: Teachers and Staff training and education; Educational quality and standards; Curriculum and Pedagogy; Vocational education and Counseling; Ubiquitous and lifelong learning; Training programs and professional guidance; Teaching and learning relationship; Student affairs (learning, experiences and diversity); Extra-curricular activities; Assessment and measurements in Education. (2) In PROJECTS AND TRENDS: Pedagogic innovations; Challenges and transformations in Education; Technology in teaching and learning; Distance Education and eLearning; Global and sustainable developments for Education; New learning and teaching models; Multicultural and (inter)cultural communications; Inclusive and Special Education; Rural and indigenous Education; Educational projects. (3) In TEACHING AND LEARNING: Critical Thinking; Educational foundations; Research and development methodologies; Early childhood and Primary Education; Secondary Education; Higher Education; Science and technology Education; Literacy, languages and Linguistics (TESL/TEFL); Health Education; Religious Education; Sports Education. (4) In ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES: Educational policy and leadership; Human Resources development; Educational environment; Business, Administration, and Management in Education; Economics in Education; Institutional accreditations and rankings; International Education and Exchange programs; Equity, social justice and social change; Ethics and values; Organizational learning and change, Corporate Education. This book contains the results of the research and developments conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to promote growth in research methods intimately related to teaching, learning and applications in Education nowadays. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, who will extend our view in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues, by sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. We would like to express thanks to all the authors and participants, the members of the academic scientific committee, and of course, to our organizing and administration team for making and putting this conference together.

AB  - This study used the framework of technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) to examine how elementary education preservice teachers integrated technology in science units that they designed after completing courses on science education and technology integration. The findings indicate that technologies included at the end of lessons were associated with higher order thinking, while those included at the beginning or middle of lessons were focused more on lower order thinking and presenting content. Further, frequently used technology-rich activities such as viewing videos and PowerPoint presentations were associated with lower order thinking, while activities such as completing an interactive whiteboard activity or having students make presentations or videos included more opportunities to develop higher order thinking. Implications from this research suggest that science educators and teacher educators should focus more on technologies that support higher-order thinking and support course work with special attention to technology in the context of designing engaging science instruction.

AB  - Teachers need to be able to design and implement problem-based learning (PBL) experiences to help students master the content and the processes in new mathematics and science education standards. Due to the changed population of learners within schools, it is also critically important that teachers in the elementary grades have the abilities to work effectively with English language learners (ELL). This article discusses the implementation of a major initiative by our teachers college to achieve both of these goals through Problem-Based Enhanced Language Learning (PBELL), which combines PBL, enhanced opportunities for language, and ELL methods. The implementation began with a small group of faculty members developing and piloting PBELL experiences, with coaching spread throughout the program. Our student-teachers are graduating with multiple opportunities to experience PBELL as learners and to design and implement PBELL experiences.

AB  - Calculus is one of the primary avenues for initial quantitative training of students in all science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, but life science students have been found to underperform in the traditional calculus setting. As a result, and because of perceived lack of its contribution to the understanding of biology, calculus is being actively cut from biology program requirements at many institutions. Here, we present an alternative: a model for learning mathematics that sees the partner disciplines as crucial to student success. We equip faculty with information to engage in dialogue within and between disciplinary departments involved in quantitative education. This includes presenting a process for interdisciplinary development and implementation of biology-oriented Calculus I courses at two institutions with different constituents, goals, and curricular constraints. When life science students enrolled in these redesigned calculus courses are compared with life science students enrolled in traditional calculus courses, students in the redesigned calculus courses learn calculus concepts and skills as well as their traditional course peers; however, the students in the redesigned courses experience more authentic life science applications and are more likely to stay and succeed in the course than their peers who are enrolled in traditional courses. Therefore, these redesigned calculus courses hold promise in helping life science undergraduate students attain "Vision and Change" recommended competencies.

AB  - This column provides original articles on innovations in case study teaching, assessment of the method, as well as case studies with teaching notes. In this month's issue the authors describe an interdisciplinary approach to case study teaching that addresses the demand to balance the goals of process and content. The case study, Salem's Secrets (Nava-Whitehead and Gow 2008), is used both as an approach to introduce the scientific method and hypothesis testing and as a way to integrate learning across the curriculum. The case  examines the Salem witch trials that took place in the late 1600s in Salem, Massachusetts. Several hypotheses are presented to explain the symptoms experienced by the accusers, including mass hysteria, outright fakery, and fungal toxicity. Statistical evidence culled  from primary source records of Salem (Woodward 1969) and published in the journal "Science" (Caporael 1976; Spanos and Gottlieb 1976) is presented to students for analysis. In the end, students are expected to synthesize the information presented throughout the case to formulate a defensible conclusion supported by data that they consider  scientifically valid.

AB  - STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), one of the mostly emphasized concepts in the world, is a paradigm that creates interdisciplinary learning and provides achievement of the outcomes of science, mathematics, engineering and technology while doing this. This research was carried out to investigate the STEM fields' placement of the top thousand students placed in science and mathematics fields in universities, the Student Selection and Placement Center (ÖSYM) university placement data as a basis. This is a quantitative research and descriptive analysis techniques have been used. In the study, which has examined university placement of 17,135 students, it was determined that as the students' interest in STEM fields decreased between the years 2000-2014, the interest in faculties of medicine increased, that there is a major difference between male and female students in favor of the males, that the students were placed mostly in engineering departments among STEM fields and that placement in education faculties and fundamental sciences was rather low.

AB  - This study investigated the influence of immersive classroom simulation activities on the development of elementary pre-service teachers in two separate mathematics and science education courses that simultaneously focus on pedagogy and content. Participants submitted written personal reflections about their teaching experiences using the immersive classroom simulation activities. These reflections were analyzed for common emergent themes within and across courses. The participants discussed the benefits of the immersive classroom simulation activities in their written personal reflections. They viewed the experience as helpful in developing their skills as a practicing teacher in mathematics and science. Specifically, participants identified three sub-themes including: (a) the immersive classroom simulation activities as being beneficial by providing more authentic real-life teaching experiences than those experienced during peer-group teaching activities; (b) the importance of holding complete and appropriate understandings of content when teaching mathematics and science; and (c) the role of deep content knowledge in the process of developing high quality questions for students. This study has shown immersive classroom simulation activities to be a viable alternative for teacher education programs to engage elementary preservice teachers in developing skills regarding classroom mathematics and science discourse.

AB  - Forensic science education has evolved as an interdisciplinary science that includes medicine, chemistry, biology, and criminal justice. Therefore, multiple paths can lead to a career in forensic science. A formal education usually requires the student to attend a college or university to obtain a bachelor's or master's degree. In many cases, professionals working in the field of forensic science have a bachelor's degree in a natural science and learn hands-on, in an operational laboratory, the skills necessary to perform the required tasks applied in a forensics laboratory. To advance their knowledge or obtain a master's degree, students would traditionally have to put their career on hold to attend a college or university. Because forensic scientists are in high demand in the United States and around the world, the International Forensic Science Distance Education program at the University of Florida takes a novel approach to provide the theoretical knowledge necessary for a master's degree, enabling students to stay on the job and in touch with the practical application of their discipline. This article introduces the program and its application to college distance education programs in the natural sciences. (Contains 2 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - Integrative model of special translation training considers the understanding of a foreign text as the key stage of the given activity, which is to large extent stipulated by characteristics of both the source text sender and the translation text recipient. Interdisciplinary approach permitted to involve maximum number of determining factors to consider the given characteristics. Such a possibility is given by information-reference search and analysis of utterance from discursive positions, i.e. considering the specificity of science and technique institute, professional communication, variety of text genres, stipulated by communicative function and aims of communication, characteristics of sender and recipient utterance, socio-cultural factors that influence a special discourse creation, general regularities of its creation, stylistic characteristics, the basic methods of their realization etc. Inclusion of the given characteristics into the content of translation training permits to teach students to go beyond the frameworks of the text being analyzed and to involve maximum number of factors that stipulate the understanding and interpreting of the source text aimed at its further translation.

AB  - Previous research demonstrates that integration of science and literacy instruction in primary grades has positive outcomes for students' science and literacy development. However, variations in how science and literacy are enacted suggest integration may not be sufficient to meet the literacy and science needs of all students in an equitable manner. The purpose of this study was to examine two first-grade teachers' science integration during literacy instruction in one high- and one low-income school context within one urban district. Analysis of field notes, transcripts of lessons, and interviews revealed that expectations to integrate science during time set aside for literacy instruction without consideration of contextual factors perpetuated and concealed ongoing inequities in science education for students from the lowest income school. Further, this study adds to evidence from prior studies demonstrating that reading of science-related texts alone, as a substitute for instruction in science as a discipline, does not provide students with the resources needed to learn to think, talk, and act as scientists. Findings from this study require researchers and policy-makers to address the context-specific factors that shape instructional contexts in ways that limit or expand the potential of integrated science--literacy instruction in urban schools.

AB  - A meaningful research experience with a strong mentor early in a student's educational career is formative. Many institutions recognize this and would like to have such an experience available to their best students, but it can be difficult to involve first-year students in a laboratory-based research because of their lack of background knowledge. However, it can be just as transformative for students to conduct a meaningful literature research project under the direction of an advisor. Such an experience can expose students to the culture of science and to the excitement of scientific research and can motivate them to pursue science majors and careers. This article describes a first-year, seminar-style class in which, under the direction of an advisor, students engage in a semester-long research project. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - Computer science (CS) and computational thinking (a problem-solving process used by computer scientists) teach students design, logical reasoning, and problem solving--skills that are valuable in life and in any career. Computational thinking (CT) concepts such as decomposition teach students how to break down and tackle a large complex problem. Engaging in CT practices like debugging (finding and fixing errors), persevering, and collaborating helps to prepare students to be the innovators and developers of new technologies. Elementary educators see the need and benefit of CS education but struggle to fit something new into the already packed elementary school day. While some schools have started robotics and computer science after-school clubs, these do not address the need to educate ALL students in CS. To provide equitable access to CS education, instruction needs to occur during the regular school day and in the classroom. The authors sought to address this problem by developing and implementing interdisciplinary STEM + Computer Science Problem-Based Learning (STEM+CS PBL) units in grades 3-5. CS concepts are integrated with content already being taught, thus eliminating the need for an additional block of instructional time. Each unit centers on a real-world problem, integrates multiple content areas, and includes a culminating performance task/product in which students demonstrate and apply their understanding of the concepts learned. The problem provides context and gives students a purpose for learning content area benchmarks. This article examines one of their five-week-long STEM+ CS PBL units, "Non-Native Invasion," which engaged fourth-grade students with tackling the real-world problem of the invasive Burmese python in the Everglades and required students to design a computer simulation to model and predict how its introduction to the ecosystem affects native populations.

AB  - The national Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Education Initiative favors a curriculum shift from the compartmentalization of math and science classes into discrete subject areas to an integrated, multidisciplinary experience. Many states are currently implementing programs in high schools that provide greater integration of math, sciences, and technology. Program evaluation results indicate that students participating in multidisciplinary team projects of this type exhibit significantly higher levels of motivation and develop greater cognitive skills than students in the traditional, compartmentalized curriculum (Ross & Hogaboam-Gray, 1988; Venville et al., 2000).

AB  - This research investigated the potential for curricula at the intersection of the arts and the sciences to develop creative productivity of students. The purpose of this research was to develop a series of rubric assessments to evaluate the content and creative and higher order thinking on a variety of teacher-made lesson plans and student-made products. The research used an iterative process to identify the criteria for the rubrics. The content validity process involved the use of experts in the domains of art and science education, assessment, and creativity to identify important themes from the research base of each domain. Then the process continued to teachers of cross-curricular lesson plans, to provide insights into usefulness of the constructs in practical contexts. The final instrument was used to evaluate cross-disciplinary student products. These works of art were evaluated by a sample of art teachers with over 5 years of experience. The art teachers had attended professional development offered by the Innovation Collaborative evaluator on arts integration and the rubric. The resulting inter-rater reliability estimates ranged from moderate to excellent, for each of the four rubrics. The resulting rubrics can be used to assess work in research or classroom environments.

AB  - Ubiquitous Computing, Mobile Computing and the Internet of Things (collectively referred to as UMI herein) involve recent advances in technology areas such as low-cost and miniaturized processing and sensing technologies, high-bandwidth wireless networking and so on. UMI technologies can also support the recent attempts to reform computing education. Yet, to accomplish this potential, relevant UMI learning scenarios are needed. Creating such scenarios can be challenging, since this particular field of computing education is still in its infancy. This paper discusses learning design knowledge which can orientate the future design of UMI learning scenarios. Content analysis was applied on ten quality UMI-oriented learning scenarios. The scenarios were freely accessible in online platforms, and they were designed for middle school education and for the UMI domain. Two different methodological approaches were employed: the first one involved mapping the scenarios to existing predefined learning design elements (i.e. design concepts, design principles, and design patterns). The learning design elements were previously defined in an online database and they involved ubiquitous tools. The second method involved mapping the scenarios to the parameters of a UMI learning ecology. The performed analysis revealed design concepts, principles, patterns and key characteristics underpinning the selected UMI scenarios: they cater for students' active learning and engage them in interdisciplinary projects in which students are learning across contexts in groups and solve meaningful problems that exploit the functionalities of the UMI technologies. Several recommendations concerning the creation of quality UMI learning scenarios are suggested, such as: striking a balance between conceptual understanding and 21st century lifelong learning skills, highlighting how students' collaboration is expected to happen in a UMI scenario, providing many opportunities for instructional scaffolding and explicitly mentioning spatiotemporal aspects of the UMI scenarios. These findings could be of interest to computing education researchers, tutors, and curriculum designers who wish to design UMI oriented educational scenarios.

AB  - Increasing diversity in the geosciences has remained a challenge, despite large investments made by federal agencies in minority-serving institutions (MSIs) and historically black universities and colleges (HBCUs). With increasing challenges associated with climate and environmental change and severe and frequent natural disasters that disproportionately affect underrepresented minorities, HBCUs and MSIs are primed to lead the creation of a diverse workforce responding to these challenges. In this article, I use as examples the outcomes, successes, and challenges of two federally funded programs to increase diversity in the geosciences at an HBCU: North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NCAT). The lessons learned from these programs and best practices and strategies that could be applied to build and sustain geosciences programs at HBCUs and MSIs are presented. The programs were the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Educational Partnership program (EPP)-funded NOAA Interdisciplinary Scientific Environmental Technology Cooperative Science Center (ISETCSC) involving two HBCUs and three MSIs and the National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded Opportunities for Enhancing Diversity in the Geosciences (OEDG) Track I at an HBCU and Track 2 involving two HBCUs and two MSIs. One of the successfully accomplished goals of the ISETCSC was increasing research capacity in NOAA-relevant STEM areas at HBCUs and MSIs and building sustained research and educational capacity in the atmospheric sciences at NCAT. The OEDG Track 1 program, however, failed to develop a sustained geophysics program at NCAT. These experiences showed that one-time funding might not be enough to grow programs to be self-sustaining at these institutions, unless the programs are incorporated in their long-term strategic plans. Furthermore, when institutions apply for and receive grants for new program development in the geosciences, they need to be accountable in fulfilling the commitments and promises expressed in acquiring the funds.

AB  - Drawing from their respective work at the intersection of music and science, the coauthors argue that engaging in processes of making music can help students more deeply engage in the kinds of creativity associated with inquiry based science education (IBSE) and scientists better convey their ideas to others. Of equal importance, the processes of music making can provide students a means to experience another central aspect of IBSE, the liminal ontological experience of being utterly lost in the inquiry process.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify disciplinary core ideas that should be included in secondary school agriscience programs using a panel of experts in agricultural education, and to create a matrix of disciplinary core ideas, Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources career pathways performance indicators, and the Next Generation Science Standards performance expectations. A panel of 117 experts identified a total of 162 disciplinary core ideas of STEM concepts inherent in the Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (AFNR) career pathways. The structure for agricultural education curriculum development suggested by this research (Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Disciplinary Core Ideas) is supported by recent National Research Council (2012) publications. It is prudent that the agricultural education profession utilizes structures that have been proven effective, both empirically and in practice, by other related STEM disciplines. Furthermore, utilizing a structure like other STEM disciplines will aid in cross-curricular collaborations at the local, state and national levels. If agriculture educators desire to show how agriculture is a science, as an example, then the agriculture STEM matrix should reflect the framework of AFNR agriculture and science education. The matrix should serve as the foundation for addressing curricular and teacher professional development needs.

AB  - Digital badges are graphical representations of an accomplishment. Open badges are a subset of digital badges that allow the badge owner to demonstrate achievement and the viewer to see the criteria for the badge. Open badges offer the opportunity to evidence and reward skill development, and to learn that existing formal qualifications do not. In this, the first of three articles discussing open badges in science education, the reader is introduced to the scope for using these technologies to benefit pupils, teachers and schools. Part 2 proposes a badge framework for the 'Working Scientifically' strand of the National Curriculum in England. Part 3 details a case study involving pupils aged 7-11 years in an informal education setting in which practical skills were taught overtly, using language and processes detailed in the badging framework, to facilitate the transition into secondary school science. Open badges offer the scope for explicit learning trajectories and a personalised record of skills, experience and interests to the benefit of an array of stakeholders. [For "Open Badges Part 2: The 'Working Scientifically' Framework," see EJ1248925. For "Open Badges Part 3: Framework and Strategies in Action," see EJ1248945.]

AB  - In order to thrive in today's uncertain environment, there is a need to master 21st century skills as well as knowledge of key subjects. Project-based learning (PBL) has been recommended as an important instructional strategy to prepare students for their future work and life. As teachers play an important role in classroom instructional practice, understanding their perspectives on PBL is essential in order to provide them with support for its successful implementation. We investigated how Finnish pre- and in-service class teachers and mathematics and science teachers (N = 257) view PBL in terms of (1) its objectives, (2) its characteristics, (3) the suitable application and situation regarding its implementation, and (4) support for and barriers to its implementation. We collected data from two questionnaire surveys, project plans, and reports and then analysed them quantitatively. We found that a majority of the teachers considered the development of students' knowledge and understanding of mathematics and science, and 21st century skills as important objectives of PBL in mathematics and science education. The development of teamwork skills and the connection between theory and practice were regarded as key PBL characteristics. Moreover, PBL was perceived as suitable for both revising and learning new content. Nevertheless, the relative inadequacy of resources and support for PBL implementation was reported. Of particular necessity were ready-made project instructions, ideas, tips, and examples; advice from experienced teachers; training and guidance on basic PBL issues; and more time allocation. We discuss implications for teachers' professional development towards PBL.

AB  - The role of empathy in human social interaction has been examined in several research fields, including medical education (ME) and social neuroscience (SN). SN yields insights into empathy based on neurobiological processes, and such information may also be relevant to ME. In this reflection article, the authors first critically review current definitions and concepts of empathy in ME and link them to recent SN findings. In the light of recent evidence from SN, research in ME regarding the positive and negative effects of empathy for physicians and patients is discussed, as well as the question whether (future) physicians differ from the general population with regard to empathic skills. Commonly used SN paradigms and ME approaches to assess empathy are contrasted, a joint approach is advocated, and implications for further interdisciplinary studies are outlined. Finally, the authors delineate the contribution of SN to the question of whether empathy is teachable, and argue that SN findings represent a potential for new ME training approaches. In conclusion, the authors discuss how the incorporation of perspectives on empathy from different research areas would benefit ME, and suggest the translation and integration of such findings into ME research approaches.

AB  - Without proper linguistic competence in English language, academic writing is one of the most challenging tasks, especially, in various genre specific disciplines by L2 novice writers. This paper examines the role of diction and expression through error analysis in English language of L2 novice writers' academic writing in interdisciplinary texts of IT & Computer sciences and Business & Management sciences. Though the importance of vocabulary in L2 academic discourse is widely recognized, there has been little research focusing on diction and expression at higher education level. A corpus of 40 introductions of the published research articles, downloaded from the journals (e.g., 20 from IT & Computer sciences and 20 Business & Management sciences) authored by L2 novice writers, was analyzed to determine lexico-grammatical errors from the texts by applying Markin4 method of Error Analysis. "Rewrites" in italics letters is an attempt to demonstrate English language flexibility, infinite vastness and richness in diction and expression, comparing it with the excerpts taken from the corpus.

AB  - A major challenge in contemporary research is how to connect medical education and cognitive neuroscience and achieve synergy between these domains. Based on this starting point we discuss how this may result in a common language about learning, more educationally focused scientific inquiry, and multidisciplinary research projects. As the topic of prior knowledge in understanding plays a strategic role in both medical education and cognitive neuroscience it is used as a central element in our discussion. A critical condition for the acquisition of new knowledge is the existence of prior knowledge, which can be built in a mental model or "schema." Formation of "schemas" is a central event in student-centered active learning, by which mental models are constructed and reconstructed. These theoretical considerations from cognitive psychology foster scientific discussions that may lead to salient issues and questions for research with cognitive neuroscience. Cognitive neuroscience attempts to understand how knowledge, insight and experience are established in the brain and to clarify their neural correlates. Recently, evidence has been obtained that new information processed by the hippocampus can be consolidated into a stable, neocortical network more rapidly if this new information fits readily into a "schema." Opportunities for medical education and medical education research can be created in a fruitful dialogue within an educational multidisciplinary platform. In this synergetic setting many questions can be raised by educational scholars interested in "evidence-based" education that may be highly relevant for integrative research and the further development of medical education.

AB  - Energy is one of the most central and richly connected ideas across all science disciplines. The purpose of this study was to develop a measurement instrument for assessing students' understanding of the energy concept within and across different science disciplines. To achieve this goal, the Inter-Disciplinary Energy concept Assessment (IDEA) was developed through a pilot test, consisting of 49 items presented in pairs: multiple-choice questions followed by open-ended justification questions. The IDEA was administered to 356 college students in the United States. The partial credit Rasch model was applied to establish evidence of validity and reliability of measures for the IDEA. Results showed that the IDEA can produce reliable and valid measures of student understanding of the energy concept in different science disciplines. No statistical difference was found between the average difficulties of items across disciplines. In addition, the four science disciplines were positively correlated in terms of student understanding of the energy concept. When item difficulties were analyzed by science content topics, it was found that students have difficulty in understanding the energy concept in atomic structure, wave, electric and magnetic energy, and modern physics content areas. This result suggests that students' difficulty in understanding the energy concept is compounded with specific science contents.

AB  - Cross-curricular programming offers unique opportunities to connect non-majors with science. In this article, the author describes personal experiences related to a novel initiative uniting science, civics, and citizenship that may serve as a model for course and program development at other colleges. In this model, students from multiple majors explored several historical and contemporary disease events. The primary pedagogical goals were to examine how both social and scientific forces shaped those events and how they have shaped society today; and to reflect on how those experiences can inform future scientific and social decisions.

AB  - Set against the backdrop of a STEM-based (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) activity in a teacher education science methods class, the author examines the need for ethics education to be partnered with STEM education. To make the case, the origin of the STEM initiative, undertaken and strongly supported by both US government and corporate sources, is briefly recounted. The STSE initiative (science, technology, society and environment) is posited as a counterpoint to STEM. Also considered are: (a) an historical perspective of science and technology as these impact difficult individual and social decision making; (b) STEM knowledge generation considered through the lens of Habermas' threefold knowledge typology; and (c) the experiences of the teacher candidates working through the STEM activity when an ethical challenge is posed. The author demonstrates the need for a moral component for science education and makes the case for a partnership between STEM and ethics education. Further, such a partnership has been shown to increase student enjoyment and motivation for their science studies. Three possible ethical frameworks are examined for their theoretical and practical utility in a science classroom.

AB  - As science teacher educators attempt to prepare teachers to underscore the aims of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013) alongside the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (NGAC and CCSSO, 2010), they must pay close attention to the intersection of these two content areas. To address this challenge, the authors (a science educator and mathematics educator) created an experience for preservice teachers (PSTs) to learn and apply core concepts and processes of mathematics and science within our methods courses. Specifically, this was a concerted effort to support PSTs' data analysis and interpretation skills within the context of scientific inquiry. In the unit described, codeveloped and implemented in a mathematics and science methods course, elementary PSTs are provided with clear scaffolds to apply their developing knowledge of data analysis and interpretation to a scientific inquiry. This integrated unit showcases one way teacher preparation programs can support PSTs' understanding of how to analyze and interpret data and their ability to teach it in their future classrooms. As we make concerted efforts to address the new national standards, teacher educators must model strategic interdisciplinary planning and curriculum to make authentic connections across subject areas.

AB  - This paper presents the experience of an initiative, the EXPLORE courses, designed to bring science and technology closer to secondary school. The EXPLORE courses, organised by "EXPLORATORI: Natural Resources" project, are particularly addressed to secondary school teachers and are conducted at Catalonia (North East of Spain). The main objective is to provide secondary school teachers with the opportunity to explore the natural resources. Based on a combination of face-to-face and online learning, the programme of the courses uses an interdisciplinary approach, integrating Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and STEAM (STEM + art) fields. Data presented in this paper correspond to the 2012 and 2013 editions. The results, which were obtained from a written questionnaire completed by teacher participants of EXPLORE courses, indicate that more than 70% of secondary school teachers were encouraged to introduce some course contents on their teaching classes after participating in an EXPLORE course.

AB  - Design-based learning (DBL) is an educational approach grounded in the processes of inquiry and reasoning towards generating innovative artifacts, systems and solutions. The approach is well characterized in the context of learning natural sciences in secondary education. Less is known, however, of its characteristics in the context of higher engineering education. The purpose of this review study is to identify key characteristics of DBL in higher engineering education. From the tenets of engineering design practices and higher engineering education contexts we identified four relevant dimensions for organizing these characteristics: the project characteristics, the role of the teacher, the assessment methods, and the social context. Drawing on these four dimensions, we systematically reviewed the state-of-the-art empirical literature on DBL or DBL-like educational projects in higher engineering education. Based on this review we conclude that DBL projects consist of open-ended, hands-on, authentic and multidisciplinary design tasks resembling the community of engineering professionals. Teachers facilitate both the process of gaining domain-specific knowledge and the thinking activities relevant to propose innovative solutions. Teachers scaffold students in the development from novice to expert engineers. Assessment is characterized by formative and summative of both individual and team products and processes and by the use of a variety of assessment instruments. Finally, the social context of DBL projects includes peer-to-peer collaboration in which students work in teams. The implications of these findings for further research on DBL in higher engineering education are discussed.

AB  - This article shares the "Paper Circuit Story Timeline" and the "Story Quilting" project from the Elementary STEM Teaching Integrating Technology and Computing Holistically (E-STITCH) curriculum, a free curriculum and project guide set for grades 3-6. The E-STITCH curriculum is designed as a method for teaching science and social studies together in order to teach both in more culturally responsive and inclusive ways. Students learn science content around energy transfer and circuits as a means to produce projects that highlight their social studies learning about immigration, migration, and forced relocation--topics that are relevant to children living across the United States. This article outlines how these projects were implemented as part of an energy transfer unit within a fourth-grade classroom, but they can be easily modified to meet the needs of students in grades 3-6.

AB  - Purpose: This paper unfolds the ways in which Croatia, as a young post-communist democracy, has aligned its transition and consolidation with the development of education programs that would support the protection of human rights and the creation of a democratic political culture. Design/methodology/approach: By combining the existing studies with the authors' own analyses of documents and internet sources, as well as interviews with teachers, this paper reveals that by adopting vague and non-binding policies, the Croatian political elite has demonstrated a lack of political will and courage over the past twenty-five years to develop a systematic and quality-based citizenship education. Findings: After long-term negligence, in the most recent five-year period, the need to change the educational path has gained prominence on the policy and political agenda. However, the reform process did not result in bridging, but in the deepening of ideological divides within the Croatian society. With the officially adopted interdisciplinary and cross-curricular approach, the responsibility for carrying out citizenship education was placed in the hands of teachers, with civil society organizations taking a compensating role. Whilst the former lack practical education, as well as guidelines and resources to incorporate citizenship education into the subjects they teach, the latter are incapable of reaching out to a sufficient share of the youth population. The outcome is that the youth continuously displays inadequate levels of citizenship competences.

AB  - Integration of anatomy and clinical teaching is a theoretical ideal, yet there is a worldwide paucity of such amalgamation. These teaching models provide support for medical trainees, an important element in Germany where orthopedic intern numbers have declined and anecdotal evidence suggests disinterest in orthopedics. The aim of the study was to develop an integrated anatomy-surgical course for undergraduate medical training, assess the model developed, and explore how medical students perceive orthopedics as a career. The course was to deliver medical anatomy and clinical orthopedic training, focusing on interdisciplinary teaching and learning, vertical integration of clinical knowledge and skills, and professional interaction. Survey evaluation of the course and students' perceptions of orthopedic careers was performed, including Likert-type responses rating variables of interest. A phased-concept program of five courses, each optional and under one-week in duration, was developed parallel to the undergraduate medical program. Delivered by anatomists and surgeons, courses included biomechanics, advanced dissection, surgical approaches, casts and implants, and sports medicine. Course data indicate positive support for course format, stimulation of interest, and high clinical relevance. Students are generally interested in surgery, and identify hierarchy, lawsuits, bureaucracy and physical stress as barriers to orthopedic careers. This novel phased-concept successfully delivers combined anatomy and surgery training in a vertically-integrated format while addressing students' clinical and professional skills. The format facilitates an appreciation of potential career options in orthopedics, while fostering professional skills during medical training. Barriers to careers in orthopedics can now be addressed in future courses.

AB  - Like several scientists, Isaac Newton has been represented many times over many different periods, and portraits of Newton were often commissioned by the scientist himself. These portraits tell us a lot about the scientist, the artist and the cultural context. This article examines two very different portraits of Newton that were realized more than a century apart, to show how the observer's attention can be focused on the history of physics, the history of art, their relationships and the use of the history of science in science education.

AB  - Learning modules provide an effective means of encouraging cognition and active learning. This paper discusses several such modules that have been developed within a course on weather radar applications intended for students from Electrical Engineering and Meteorology. The modules were designed both to promote interdisciplinary exchange between the students and to guide them from a theoretical to an applied understanding of weather radar and the interactions of radio waves with geophysical media. The learning modules introduce students to various means of acquiring weather radar data from real-time and archival sources and ways in which to query and visualize them. They are also tasked with analyzing data from several actual and significant meteorological events and asked to assess the strengths and limitations of current methods of retrieving rainfall rates. Data sources include both weather radars and complementary surface-based instrumentation. The modules may be used in a variety of locations and by a diversity of students. Although developed for weather radar applications, the concepts discussed are applicable to other interdisciplinary classroom environments. (Contains 3 tables and 5 figures.)

AB  - This study reported the results of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analyses on 13 competing structural models on the inter-relationships among academic achievement and student- and course-related attributes. The samples were Malaysian pre-university students enrolled in two STEM courses (biology, n = 326; mathematics, n = 339; biology only, n = 92; mathematics only, n = 105; biology and mathematics, n = 234). For both courses, interdisciplinary cross-validation was observed for four models which hypothesized that current academic achievement could be predicted (1) directly by prior academic achievement (high school grades) and student approaches to learning (SAL), and (2) directly and/or indirectly by personality, intrinsic motivation and course experience (CE). For at least one course, all constructs (except intrinsic motivation, clear goals and standards, openness and conscientiousness) significantly and directly predicted current academic achievement. The strongest predictor of current academic achievement was prior (high school) academic achievement, with the largest effect sizes, followed by SAL. Current academic achievement was significantly and positively predicted by all CE constructs (except clear goals and standards) for only mathematics, with moderate and large effect sizes. Only one personality construct (neuroticism) significantly and moderately predicted current academic achievement (biology). SAL partially mediated relationships between current academic achievement with workload appropriateness, assessment for understanding and neuroticism for at least one course. Generally, the strongest predictors of SAL were assessment for understanding, workload appropriateness and intrinsic motivation. Multigroup invariance analysis revealed differences in five hypothesized paths, attributable almost entirely to significant paths found in mathematics but not biology (prior [high school] to current academic achievement, conscientiousness to surface approach to learning, intrinsic motivation to deep and surface approaches to learning). Therefore, this study is the first to report course-nuanced differences in the presence of reduced interpersonal differences. The implications of this study is that, besides the importance of prior high academic achievement which might not be within educators' control, factors in the teaching--learning ecosystem within educators' control which influence current academic achievement are strongly mediated by SAL, which is itself influenced most by assessment, workload and intrinsic motivation.

AB  - With the increasing emphasis on integrating engineering into K-12 classrooms to help meet the needs of our complex and multidisciplinary society, there is an urgent need to investigate teachers' engineering-focused professional development experiences as they relate to teacher learning, implementation, and student achievement. This study addresses this need by examining the effects of a professional development program focused on engineering integration, and how teachers chose to implement engineering in their classrooms as a result of the professional development. 198 teachers in grades 3-6 from 43 schools in 17 districts participated in a yearlong professional development program designed to help integrate the new state science standards, with a focus on engineering, into their teaching. Posters including lesson plans and student artifacts were used to assess teachers' engineering practices and the implementation in their classrooms. Results indicated that the majority of the teachers who participated in the professional development were able to effectively implement engineering design lessons in their classrooms suggesting that the teachers' success in implementing engineering lessons in their classroom was closely related to the structure of the professional development program.

AB  - This study featured findings from a three-year National Science Foundation (NSF) funded research project at a STEM focused college. 'Project Synapse' was developed to build relevance between disciplines through authentic collaborations between biology and chemistry content. Integrated science practices were explicitly addressed during investigations of interdisciplinary topics such as microscopy and redox reactions. This study focused on the impact of one integrated laboratory-based intervention on student nature of science (NOS) understanding. Using a previously validated survey, Views on Nature of Science (VNOS), student NOS knowledge was assessed at the beginning and end of the academic school year. Structured interviews were conducted to gather a more indepth understanding of student thinking. Additional qualitative data sets included participant observations of labs, interviews with in instructors, and focus groups with students. Project Synapse students performed better on both the pre and post assessments of NOS understanding. At the close of the academic year, Project Synapse students scored higher in the domains of inference and theoretical entities in science and nature of scientific theories as compared to students not exposed to the model. Students in both the control and experimental group struggled to discriminate between theories and laws or provide specific examples. his integrated model offered a more authentic look at the actual practices of science through investigations that extended beyond a single subject area. Findings suggest that this collaborative instructional model may provide greater opportunities to address NOS content throughout the school year.

AB  - Because innovation is essential to the future of our society and because there is a need to prepare college students to succeed in business organizations, it has become increasingly important to investigate the factors that enhance or discourage creativity and innovation. College professors have a vital role in introducing students to the fundamentals of innovation and, depending on how they do, can potentially encourage or discourage the innovation process. This study focused on the communication and motivation in the innovation process of faculty in a multidisciplinary course comprised of agricultural economics, biosystems and agricultural engineering, and agricultural communication majors at a large land-grant university. Results demonstrated that students did not always find faculty communication effective, and findings among students in the three majors were different in faculty communication ratings. The data show there are positive relationships between students' perceptions of faculty communications and students' motivation in capstone courses. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - This investigation examines English as foreign language college interdisciplinary and intercultural differences in learning strategy use and their implications for language processing. Positivism underpins this research at the levels of ontology (standardized variables), epistemology (detachment from the subjects) and methodology, using nomothetic research strategy (survey), instruments (questionnaires) and data analysis techniques (multivariate analysis of variance and analysis of variance). Main findings show interdisciplinary differences between the Humanities and Science majors in student use of compensation strategies in favour of the Science major while finding no intermajor differences in student use of other strategies. The findings indicate no ethnic differences in learning strategy use, since European, American and Eastern ethnicities almost use typical strategies. Therefore, disagreements on alleged unmediated deterministic relationships between ethnicity and cognitive processing remain in place. Instead, curriculum and instructional designs, strategy training and individual differences rather than cultural stereotypes influence language processing. For curriculum and instructional designs to facilitate language processing and pedagogy, effective strategies should underlie national, classroom-level and school-level curriculum developments.

AB  - The well-being of modern economies and societies is increasingly requiring citizens to possess capabilities in integrating knowledge and skills in science, technology, engineering and science to solve problems. However, by the end of schooling, the majority of Australian students show little interest in these discipline areas and have no plans to continue study or work in them; many refer to these disciplines as boring. Further, they typically have little experience in integrating knowledge and skills from these disciplines and/or in applying this to solve relevant problems. Therefore, there is a need to engage students with such learning experiences to develop their interest and capabilities, particularly during the early years of secondary schooling. This is not easy for teachers to respond to, but with the support of modern digital technologies and the new Australian curriculum, the potential is expanded and the challenge is more readily achievable. However, appropriate pedagogies need to be supported that include more authentic approaches to assessment. Learning activities need to support students to integrate knowledge and skills across discipline areas in tackling real problems, and this also needs to be reflected in how students are assessed. In this paper, I will draw on personal experience as a teacher, a review of recent literature, components of the Australian Curriculum, and findings from research projects associated with my University research centre, to argue for, and illustrate how, teachers can orchestrate powerful learning activities to promote an interdisciplinary approach to STEM.

AB  - Spatial thinking skills are vital for success in everyday living and work, not to mention the centrality of spatial reasoning in scientific discoveries, design-based disciplines, medicine, geosciences and mathematics to name a few. This case study describes a course in spatial thinking and communicating designed and delivered by an interdisciplinary team over a three-year period to first-year university students. Four major elements provide a framework for the sequencing of instruction and acquisition of 2D and 3D spatial thinking and reasoning skills in a computational design context. We describe the process of introducing students to computational design environments beginning with a fun and familiar tool in preparation for a more complex, industry-standard system (SolidWorks). A design project provides diverse student teams an opportunity to integrate and apply foundational spatial concepts and skills including sketching, 2D and 3D representations, as well as digital and physical modeling. Samples of student work illustrate the scaffolding necessary for students to successfully draw upon the spatial thinking and communication skills required to complete their team projects beginning with applying sketching techniques; modeling individual 3D parts; creating digital assemblies; and finally building the equivalent 3D physical model. Key instructional principles provide a framework for the analysis of what worked and what didn't in relation to spatial skills development in students. The lessons learned are identified along with potential future directions for teaching and learning scholarship in spatial thinking development within a computational design context.

AB  - This paper is intended to stimulate discussion and recommendations related to science and technology education and its role in sustainable development. It puts forward points of view and addresses concerns in science education. The paper recognizes that all in not well within science and technology education and that there are concerns related to its vision, its philosophy, its research, its approach, its way of meeting needs, its expected outcomes and most definitely in the manner in which it is taught. This paper recognises that science and technology education must do more than simply pay "lip service" to sustainable development and must focus learning on issues of relevance facing society. It is simply not enough to apply scientific ideas to technological application. The education context must provide the frame for learning. As this is heavily interdisciplinary and related to values, so must be science education. This in turn suggests there is a need to re-examine the goals of education and with this the goals of science education. It is suggested that education for sustainable development has little to do with accumulating a body of scientific knowledge and is far more aligned with the development of personal and social aptitudes leading to responsible citizenship.

AB  - The development of transferrable skillsets, articulated in statements of graduate learning outcomes, is emphasised in undergraduate science degree programmes. Science students enrolled in dual (double) degrees comprise a significant minority of Australian science undergraduates. Research comparing perceptions of single and dual degree students on their science learning outcomes has rarely been explored. The Science Students Skills Inventory was used to compare the perceptions of single (n = 640) and dual (n = 266) degree undergraduate science students. The instrument explored science graduate learning outcomes across six indicators: importance; the extent to which outcomes were included; the extent to which they were assessed; improvement; confidence; and likely future use. Analysis of findings, employing the "planned-enacted-experienced" curricula framework, offers insight into potential avenues towards coherence of the "experienced" curriculum by arguing the need for shared perceptions of graduate learning outcomes for single and dual degree science students. The key contribution of this study is a shift towards progressive curriculum development that draws on both single and dual degree student perspectives to achieve graduate learning outcomes. Recommendations include: whole-of-programmes curricular pathways premised on progressive development of learning outcomes that are inclusive of dual degree students, explicit interdisciplinary learning opportunities, and adoption of dual/single status as a demographic variable reported in future research.

AB  - Development of post-secondary curriculum in emerging interdisciplinary fields presents particular challenges in course design and resource utilization, especially when the field is interdisciplinary by nature of its inherent breadth. A new course at the University of Calgary, designed to introduce undergraduate students to the methods and philosophy of Acoustic Ecology--the study of sound and its effects on health, cognition and culture--exemplifies both the challenges and some practical solutions. Following a brief history of the concept and its philosophy, a summary and critique is presented from the first offering of the course as a pilot project. Conclusions drawn include the necessity of an integrative approach to interdisciplinary fields of study that are true "interdisciplines", the utility of experiential fieldwork, and the advantages presented by a student group with diverse academic backgrounds.

AB  - Abstract: Students' perception of 8 criteria (rationale of the problem; interdisciplinary learning; facilitator asked essential questions; learner's skills; assessments; facilitation procedures; team's use of resources [team collaboration], and facilitator within a problem-based learning context) were assessed for a food biotechnology course that was part of a 3rd year biotechnology program. The mean score for "perceived learner's skills" was the lowest whereas those for "facilitation" and "facilitator" were the highest. Selected qualitative comments from students were also analyzed. This study demonstrated interdisciplinary learning as the students could make meaningful connections across different science disciplines. Further investigation is needed to develop possible strategies to accommodate the challenges in making meaningful connections across science disciplines as well as to develop a defined hybrid method for analysis of students' responses.

AB  - Inspired by "BIO2010" and leveraging institutional and external funding, Truman State University built an undergraduate program in mathematical biology with high-quality, faculty-mentored interdisciplinary research experiences at its core. These experiences taught faculty and students to bridge the epistemological gap between the mathematical and life sciences. Together they created the infrastructure that currently supports several interdisciplinary courses, an innovative minor degree, and long-term interdepartmental research collaborations. This article describes how the program was built with support from the National Science Foundation's Interdisciplinary Training for Undergraduates in Biology and Mathematics program, and it shares lessons learned that will help other undergraduate institutions build their own program.

AB  - We present a novel assessment tool for measuring biology students' values and experiences across their undergraduate degree program. Our Survey of Teaching Beliefs and Practices for Undergraduates (STEP-U) assesses the extent to which students value skills needed for the workplace (e.g., ability to work in groups) and their experiences with teaching practices purported to promote such skills (e.g., group work). The survey was validated through factor analyses in a large sample of biology seniors (n = 1389) and through response process analyses (five interviewees). The STEP-U skills items were characterized by two underlying factors: retention (e.g., memorization) and transfer (e.g., knowledge application). Multiple linear regression models were used to examine relationships between classroom experiences, values, and student characteristics (e.g., gender, cumulative grade point average [GPA], and research experience). Student demographic and experiential factors predicted the extent to which students valued particular skills. Students with lower GPAs valued retention skills more than those with higher GPAs. Students with research experience placed greater value on scientific writing and interdisciplinary understanding. Greater experience with specific teaching practices was associated with valuing the corresponding skills more highly. The STEP-U can provide feedback vital for designing curricula that better prepare students for their intended postgraduate careers.

AB  - The education of future health care professionals must involve activities where interprofessional collaboration and the functioning of interdisciplinary teams are the goals and not the exceptions. This type of interprofessional education (IPE) will benefit students as they will be better able to communicate with and mobilize the skills of other health care workers, work toward common goals related to patient care, and develop a more cost-effective treatment strategy in the long term. Such an IPE program was initiated in the clinical anatomy course for physician assistant students from the University of Mount Union that was taught, in part, by medical students from the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University. Surveys of both student groups at the end of the course indicated that although this was a useful IPE experience, the value of this program as an IPE experience was not entirely appreciated by the participating students. It turned out that although the goals and importance of these types of IPE activities are clear to the faculty, they must also be made clear to all of the students.

AB  - The US Forest Service has a long history of youth conservation education. We investigated U.S. Forest Service citizen science programs that involve secondary school students in field collection of monitoring data to understand (1) how the programs integrated science and environmental education and (2) whether these programs advance ecological literacy and environmental stewardship. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the program leads, teachers, and students. Program leads and students said programs produced reliable data and met monitoring and other U.S. Forest Service stewardship objectives. Although these programs varied in design and objectives, our findings suggest these programs were incorporating both science and environmental education, and there is some indication they are creating ecological literacy among participants. Students exhibited environmental stewardship to some degree as a result of all programs, but the extent of this is tied to programs' objectives and design.

AB  - Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education has become an international focus of science education curricular reforms. However, few K-12 teachers have the background to authentically teach STEM in an integrated way. This is especially true of elementary teachers, who are often less confident or prepared to teach STEM disciplines independently. Most methods courses for preservice elementary teachers are taught independently by content area (math, science, language arts, and social studies), and seldom model integrated teaching strategies. Preservice teachers should have opportunities to experience and create developmentally appropriate curricula that integrate STEM disciplines. This study sought to bridge elementary preservice math and science methods courses through the modeling of integrated STEM lessons. The researchers who served as course instructors codesigned a STEM unit and collaborated throughout the semester. After explicit modeling and practice, surveys and lesson plans were used to determine the preservice elementary teachers' understandings of STEM and their ability to plan integrated STEM lessons. In both the science and mathematics methods courses, the month-long unit on STEM education included explicitly modeled STEM lessons and culminated with preservice teachers planning, teaching, and reflecting on their own integrated lessons. Although misconceptions that a STEM lesson needed to address every discipline remained, the teachers' ability to recognize and design lessons improved. This study supports the value of collaboratively taught elementary math and science methods courses to provide the experiences teachers will need to deliver STEM instruction in their classrooms.

AB  - Worldwide, innovation in education is highly perceived as an effectual approach to promote awareness for sustainability. International organizations interested in education, research and training support projects seeking modernization of Higher Education (HE) and put much emphasis on developing new curricula, teaching methods or materials to respond to current needs. Building ties and promoting cooperation between institutions around the world through Universities and academic arenas are central in innovative educational approaches. This paper reflects on one of such projects; the Center for Natural Resources and Development (CNRD) which aims at supporting achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7. Eleven University faculties in Brazil, Chile, Egypt, Germany, Indonesia, Jordan, Mexico, Mozambique, Nepal, and Vietnam form part of the CNRD, covering natural, engineering, and social sciences disciplines. To develop solutions for one of the most pressing problems of today; creating sustainable cities, students, teachers and researchers work together in a trans-disciplinary approach. The paper principally deals with the question of how international research and education networks can narrow the distance between countries and promote awareness of sustainability. It discusses approaches in joint education, using modern media and e-learning activities and their contribution to raise awareness of sustainability among young researchers.

AB  - This paper focuses on the professional development of formal science educators through extraordinary experiences that occur within the realm of informal science learning. For many years the University of Colorado Denver (UCD) has offered programs that take teachers on "science learning journeys" to Africa, South America, through the Pacific, and many U.S. destinations through its Experiential Science Education Research Collaborative (XSci). On these adventures, teachers gain direct, first person experiences of unique and often challenging environments and multidisciplinary science within those settings. Similar professional development opportunities for teachers are widespread as summer programs through organizations nationwide. However, there is currently a lack of in-depth qualitative research investigating the actual benefits and interpretive nature of such programs as personal and professional "extraordinary" science learning experiences for the individuals who participate in them. The research agenda for the XSci Collaborative examines the experiences of educators engaged in informal extraordinary professional development experiences in order to understand the personal processes that make them extraordinary and valuable. Specifically, the primary research approach is to examine the "interpretation" of these experiences by teachers as case studies under the conceptual framework of a phenomenology. This approach utilizes several data sources, including teacher-created digital stories and video documentaries as personal narratives of their extraordinary experience; journals completed throughout the experiences, pre and post experience interviews, classroom observations and student interviews.

AB  - The article describes the methods of teaching students majoring in languages with the use of practice-oriented exercises, the need for the development and implementation of which is defined by a new methodological basis of modern higher vocational education--a competence-based approach. The study hypothesis involves the assumption that practice-oriented exercises allow to intensify the mental, practical and creative student activities, form a positive motivation both to study Japanese and be engaged in future professional activities. The article contains the results of the joint work of teachers of the Sakhalin State University on drawing up and introduction of practice-oriented exercises for students studying Japanese at the level of professional communication at the university and majoring in "Oriental and African Studies" and "Pedagogical Education." The study represents the general content of practice-oriented exercises, implying an interdisciplinary impact and integration of training courses, independent work of students, students' clear understanding of the ultimate goals of the task and assessment means. The content of each exercise, the rationale for its development, objectives, targets, the progress and the learning results have been described in detail. Students' comments have been presented demonstrating the efficiency of using practice-oriented exercises in the educational process.

AB  - Sustainability education (SE) is included in school curricula to integrate the principles, values, and practices of sustainable development (SD) into all education. This study investigates lower secondary school subject teachers as educators for sustainability. A survey was used to study the perceptions of 442 subject teachers from 49 schools in Finland. There were significant differences between the subject teachers' perceptions of their SE competence, and the frequency with which they used different dimensions of SE (ecological, economic, social, well-being, cultural) in their teaching varied. Teachers' age had a small effect, but gender, school, and its residential location were nonsignificant factors. Teachers could be roughly classified into three different subgroups according to their perceptions of the role of SE in their teaching; those who considered three SE dimensions rather often and used holistic sustainability approaches in their teaching (biology, geography, history); those who considered two or three dimensions often but were not active in holistic teaching (mother tongue, religion, visual arts, crafts, music, physical and health education, and home economics) and those who used one SE dimension or consider only one holistic approach in their teaching (mathematics, physics, chemistry and language). Subject teachers' awareness of their SE competence is important to encourage them to plan and implement discipline-based and interdisciplinary SE in their teaching. The specific SE expertise of subject teachers should be taken into account in teacher training and education.

AB  - Computer science and the liberal arts have much to offer each other. Yet liberal arts colleges, in particular, have been slow to recognize the opportunity that the study of computer science provides for achieving the goals of a liberal education. After the precipitous drop in computer science enrollments during the first decade of this century, many small liberal arts colleges, like their large university counterparts, found themselves with significantly diminished numbers of majors. From the author's perspective, the primary issue is that neither students nor educators really understand what computer science is. Consequently, they do not recognize the opportunities it provides for practicing precise logical and algorithmic thinking, for developing creative solutions to difficult problems, and perhaps most importantly, for encouraging interdisciplinary approaches. In this article, the author discusses what computer science education can contribute to a liberal arts education and vice versa.

AB  - Interest to axiosphere as the sphere of values and its correlation with the ever-progressive noosphere as sphere of knowledge of a person is due to comprehension of the modern period in the evolution of society. The aim of the article is to describe an axiological aspect of the research of identity as an element of human and language universes. The material of research is made by the term identity and the ways of its representation in Russian and French (nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives). For achievement of a goal of research, we use the cognitive, discursive and semantic approaches to the studying of the axiological aspect of the identity. The article deals with the modern linguistic axiological analysis and offers a detailed account of "ethnosemimetry" as one of its possible implementations. The work specifies the principles and contexts of the method employment and features an axiological analysis of the lexeme "identity" in the French and Russian languages. The term "identity" is in the spotlight of the modern anthropocentric vector of research. It is recommended that interdisciplinary development of research of "identity" should include complex methods of analysis of the identity as an element of human and language universes.

AB  - The relevance of the researched problem stems from ecological issues that are a reflection of the contemporary culture crisis covering the whole range of people's interactions with each other, with society and with nature. In many respects, an ecological crisis is an ideological crisis and global environmental problems are impossible to solve without development of ecological culture, without the joint efforts of experts in various fields of science, industry, art and education. This article aims to substantiate the special role of design in solving the challenges of sustainable development, in particular, in the development of consumer culture, as it is an integrated and interdisciplinary activity involved in the social, political, economic and technical processes. The leading methods of investigating this problem are the ones of cultural and historical analysis that allow to comprehensively trace trends in design taking into account adequate cultural context, ideology and system of social values. The article deals with the socio-cultural role and involvement of design in the process of consumption and control of consumers' minds in the context of environmental issues; substantiates the necessity to change the design determinants, values and worldview orientation of design that will affect the consumer culture in accordance with the objectives of sustainable development and will promote the development of society's ecological culture.

AB  - Argumentation has become an increasingly recognized focus for science instruction--as a learning process, as an outcome associated with the appropriation of scientific discourse, and as a window onto the epistemic work of science. Only a small set of theoretical conceptualizations of argumentation have been deployed and investigated in science education, however, while a plethora of conceptualizations have been developed in  the interdisciplinary fields associated with science studies and the learning sciences. This  paper attempts to review a range of such theoretical conceptualizations of argumentation  and discuss the possible implications for the orchestration of science education; the goal  being that the science education research community might consider a broader range of  argumentation forms and roles in conjunction with the learning of science.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: This paper investigates the gaps between industry and academia perceptions of information technology fields, such as computer science, software engineering, and computer engineering, and it identifies areas of asymmetry between curricula and industry expectations. The study mainly focuses on the skills required of IT professionals (graduated students) and on how higher education institutes equip students for industry. Background: Higher education institutes have several IT-related departments. However, it is not clear whether these departments have sufficient content to equip students with industry-related skills. Rapid advances mean that some curriculum topics are redundant before the end of a standard two- or four-year degree programs. Balancing the technical/non-technical skills and adjusting the curricula to better prepare the students for industry is a constant demand for higher education institutions. Several studies have demonstrated that a generic curriculum is inadequate to address current IT industry needs. Methodology: The study involved a comprehensive survey of IT professionals and companies using a Web-based questionnaire sent directly to individual companies, academics, and employers. 64 universities and 38 companies in 24 countries were represented by the 209 participants, of whom 99 were IT professionals, 72 academics, and 38 employers. Contribution: This paper is intended to guide academics in preparing dynamic curricula that can be easily adapted to current industry trends and technological developments, with content directly relevant to student's careers. In addition, the results may identify the skills that students need to secure employment and the courses that will provide skills in line with current industry trends. Findings: The results indicate a lack of emphasis on personal and non-technical skills in undergraduate education compared to general computer science, software development, and coding courses. Employers' and software experts' responses emphasize that soft skills should not be ignored, and that, of these, analytical thinking and teamwork are the two most requested. Rather than a theoretical emphasis, courses should include hands-on projects. Rapid developments and innovations in information technologies demand that spiral and waterfall models are replaced with emerging software development models, such as Agile and Scrum development. Recommendations for Practitioners: A multidisciplinary approach should be taken to the teaching of soft skills, such as communication, ethics, leadership, and customer relations. Establishing multiple learning tracks in IT education would equip students with specialized knowledge and skills in IT. An effective communication channel should be established between students and industry. It is also important to reduce the distance between academics and students and to provide an interactive environment for technical discussions. Enterprise level computing and Framework use provide job market advantages. Recommendations for Researchers: Researchers and department heads, particularly those involved in curriculum design and accreditation, could use the results of this exemplary study to identify key topics for attention. Impact on Society: Changes of various degrees are required in the current curricula in many higher education institutions to better meet student needs. Societies and technology are dynamic in nature, and information technology-related curricula in higher education institutions should be equally dynamic. Future Research: Since technology (especially information technology) transforms and advances itself so rapidly, this study should be replicated t to investigate how these changes affect the gap between revised curricula and current industry expectations.

AB  - Introducing Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (NST) topics into school science curricula is considered useful for an in-depth understanding of the content, processes and nature of science and technology, and also for negotiating the social aspects of science. This study examines (a) the development of an inquiry-based Teaching-Learning Sequence (TLS) on NST topics, which incorporates socio-scientific issues and out-of-school learning environments and (b) the dissemination of the developed TLS through the training of further teachers. In both cases, a participatory design, in particular Communities of Learners (CoLs), was established, consisting of teachers, science researchers, science education researchers and science museum experts. As a theoretical framework for the TLS development, the Model of Educational Reconstruction is used. The qualitative analysis of the obtained data highlights that teachers' interactions with colleagues in the CoL on issues regarding the educational reconstruction of the different aspects of the TLS impact the process of its development. Regarding the dissemination of the TLS, the findings indicate that teachers modified several elements of the TLS and particularly the included activities, influenced by their mentors' prior experience and their own rich contextual knowledge. Finally, guidelines for the development and dissemination of a TLS are discussed.

AB  - Scientifically literate citizens are able to evaluate news reports on everyday problems with a critical stance to information, which means using both value and norm-based as well as evidence and logic based thinking. Developing a critical stance towards information in the news media, requires familiarity with a complex set of interdisciplinary skills, currently examined by standards in separate content domains. Therefore, our current schooling is limited in preparing future citizens for the combination of multiple skills and both value-based and logic-focused thinking processes. Using an exploratory, descriptive design, this study documented 14 pre-service elementary teacher candidates' critical examination of news media reports as they developed arguments about the use products from Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) discoveries in response to dire human need. The results indicated candidates' difficulties in combining logic focused thinking and the use of factual, "hard" evidence with personal perspectives based on personal values and norms. As a result their integration of evidence to develop well-supported arguments for civic action was limited. The findings suggest the need for additional studies on the evidence-interpretation processes of pre-service teacher candidates. By better understanding the argument and reasoning processes of teacher candidates, we can improve the preparation of our citizens for evidence-based civic action based on news-media reports.

AB  - Contemporary educational debate in curriculum organisation and pedagogy has focused on the merits or otherwise of integrating disciplines for more effective learning. A wide range of terms is used to describe the various traditions associated with the presentation and structure of the curriculum and there are various perspectives on the purposes and efficacy of such approaches. Terms such as cross-curricular, thematic and interdisciplinary learning encompass a broad range of interpretations that place different emphases on the process of interdisciplinary organisation. It is often suggested that integration in its various forms promotes understanding through building connections in meaningful learning contexts. However, the delivery of a more integrated curriculum depends on teachers' abilities to integrate knowledge appropriately such that pupils are able to make productive links between subjects. This presents a particular challenge in initial teacher education; this paper explores how student teachers' conceptualisation of these practices is mediated and influenced in relation to their experience in school.

AB  - This paper describes the use of a student conference as a novel experience aimed at motivating students enrolled in various computer architecture courses, such as Microprocessor Systems. The goal was to increase student engagement, to decrease failure rates, and to introduce students to the world of research. This multidisciplinary experience enabled students from several universities and cities to participate in a scientific conference while addressing novel research topics. This experience, and the understanding thus gained of the assorted roles of participants in a scientific conference--authors, reviewers, and local, steering, and scientific committees--served to increase the engagement and collaboration of both students and instructors and helped to decrease the dropout rate.

AB  - Education for human development within the constraints of sustainability is problematic for schools. On one hand, it is a political idea that continues to evolve with successive compromises between social groups with differing or even conflicting interests. ESD is therefore inherently "non-disciplinary" and cannot be the basis of a single school subject if we wish to keep the creativity that results from the dynamics at work. On the other hand, SD leads us to think collectively about solutions that ensure a future of our choosing that preserves the biological capacity of the planet and to reduce our vulnerability. The sciences thus have a key role: their ability to question the world and to model the consequences of collective and individual choices. But there is a risk of technocratic drift and SD leads us to think about society's values and aims. A new link is established between sciences and humanities with a democratic model in sight. This paper presents what is possible out of the prospective scenarios method within general and compulsory education by seeking, through an empirical approach, to determine its feasibility, its contributions, its limits, and to locate the place of science education in the elaboration of the perception of "vulnerability". Both primary and secondary schools are concerned. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Humans have long wondered about life in the universe. Are we alone? Is Earth unique? What is it that makes our planet a habitable one, and are there others like Earth? NASA's Kepler Mission seeks the answers to these questions. Kepler is a space-based, specially designed 0.95 m aperture telescope. Launching in 2009, Kepler is NASA's first mission capable of finding Earth-size and smaller planets in the habitable zone of other stars in our galaxy. Therefore, the Kepler Mission provides an opportunity for interdisciplinary science teaching, as it combines Earth and space science with life sciences. Teachers and students can bring this mission down to Earth by using the accompanying poster, partaking in classroom activities, and visiting the mission's website.

AB  - This contribution will outline the development of a specific approach of theoretical educational thinking in Germany, associated with the notions of "Didaktik"/didactics and "Fachdidaktik"/subject-matter didactics as well as its comparative, generalized form called "General Subject Didactics" (GSD). The first one deals with the 'art and science of teaching' in general, whereas the second and third one relate to disciplines of subject-matter teaching and learning in school. We will start with analysing "didactics" being in a crisis, leading to the strengthening of "subject didactics" in its place. Yet subject didactics has its own limitations and weaknesses. We will argue that these can be overcome with the help of "General Subject Didactics" which observes, compares and analyses the different subject didactics from a higher point of view: this approach can help understand the educational practice of one specific subject better and deeper, but also help moving beyond particular experiences and boundaries within that framework, towards looking at neighbouring subjects, at cross-curricular networking and cooperation. We will demonstrate how this might support the development of a powerful educational knowledge base for specialized subject teachers and their practice as educators as well as for continued professional development.

AB  - Teachers involved in the implementation of a curriculum innovation can be prepared for this task through a professional development program. In this paper, we describe essential characteristics (identified empirically and theoretically) for such a professional development program that promotes the acquisition of competences by these teachers. The innovation deals with the introduction of modules from a new multidisciplinary subject, in which elements from physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and physical geography are integrated. A 3-step approach was used to identify the essential characteristics: (a) evidence from classroom practice, (b) characteristics of the new subject, and (c) theoretical and empirical evidence from curriculum implementation studies. Analysis of the data showed that 5 characteristics need particular attention in a professional development program.

AB  - There is a strong need in the United States to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Drawing from sociocultural theory, we present approaches to establishing collaborations between computer engineering and mathematics/bilingual education faculty to address this need. We describe our work through the Advancing Out-of-School Learning in Mathematics and Engineering project by illustrating how an integrated curriculum that is based on mathematics with applications in image and video processing can be designed and how it can be implemented with middle school students from underrepresented groups.

AB  - Difficulties in teaching a multi-disciplinary subject such as the mechatronics system design module in Departments of Mechatronics Engineering at Temasek Polytechnic arise from the gap in experience and skill among staff and students who have different backgrounds in mechanical, computer and electrical engineering within the Mechatronics Department. The departments piloted a new vertical stream curricula model (VSCAM) to enhance student learning in mechatronics system design through integration of educational activities from the first to the second year of the course. In this case study, a problem-based learning (PBL) method on an autonomous vacuum robot in the mechatronics systems design module was proposed to allow the students to have hands-on experience in the mechatronics system design. The proposed works included in PBL consist of seminar sessions, weekly works and project presentation to provide holistic assessment on teamwork and individual contributions. At the end of VSCAM, an integrative evaluation was conducted using confidence logs, attitude surveys and questionnaires. It was found that the activities were quite appreciated by the participating staff and students. Hence, PBL has served as an effective pedagogical framework for teaching multidisciplinary subjects in mechatronics engineering education if adequate guidance and support are given to staff and students.

AB  - This paper reviews university-level efforts to improve understanding of anthropogenic global climate change (AGCC) through curricula that enable student scientific inquiry. We examined 152 refereed publications and proceedings from academic conferences and selected 26 cases of inquiry learning that overcome specific challenges to AGCC teaching. This review identifies both the strengths and weaknesses of each of these case studies. It is the first to go beyond examining the impact of specific inquiry instructional approaches to offer a synthesis of cases. We find that inquiry teaching can succeed by concretising scientific processes, providing access to global data and evidence, imparting critical and higher order thinking about AGCC science/policy and contextualising learning with places and scientific facts. We recommend educational researchers and scientists collaborate to create and refine curricula that utilise geospatial technologies, climate models and communication technologies to bring students into contact with scientists, climate data and authentic AGCC research processes. Many available science education technologies and curricula also require further research to maximise trade-offs between implementation and training costs and their educational value.

AB  - After the rediscovery of Mendel's laws of heredity in 1900, the biologists who began studying heredity, variation, and evolution using the new Mendelian methodology--performing controlled hybrid crosses and statistically analyzing progeny to note the factorial basis of characters--made great progress. By 1910, the validity of Mendelism was widely recognized and the field William Bateson christened "genetics" was complemented by the chromosome theory of heredity of T. H. Morgan and his group in the United States. Historians, however, have largely overlooked an important factor in the early establishment of Mendelism and genetics: the large number of women who contributed to the various research groups. This article examines the social, economic, and disciplinary context behind this new wave of women's participation in science and describes the work of women Mendelians and geneticists employed at three leading experimental research institutes, 1900-1940. It argues that the key to more women working in science was the access to higher education and the receptivity of emerging interdisciplinary fields such as genetics to utilize the expertise of women workers, which not only advanced the discipline but also provided new opportunities for women's employment in science.

AB  - In this article I explain why I wrote the set of teaching notes on Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) and why they look the way they do. The notes were intended as a student reference to question, highlight and write over as much as they wish during an initial practical demonstration of the threshold concept being introduced, in this case inferring the existence of quantized electron energy levels in atoms from class room observations. That is why the notes commence with an overview of how a handheld spectroscope works followed by how they are used for analysing emission spectroscopy observations. The notes decode the noun phrase "Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy" into its individual sequenced components by defining Light Spectra [right arrow] Spectroscopy [right arrow] Emission Spectroscopy [right arrow] Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (AES) [right arrow] Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. There is every expectation that the teacher delivering this introduction has provided a class set of hand held spectroscopes to the students and a variety of demonstration emission sources such as hollow cathode lamps for mono atomic helium and neon plus a sodium vapour lamp. This concrete experience can now be developed into abstract knowledge and analytical applications in line with the South Australian Stage 2 Chemistry Curriculum Statement (CS) requiring students to understand the principles of AES and AAS. It is also an explicit departure from the more traditional secondary school method of presenting electron energy levels in atoms as a form of ritualized knowledge. The teaching notes that follow show how practical inquiry in the secondary school class room can remain the foundation of scientific method and learning with even the most troublesome of knowledge, such as electron energy levels in atoms.

AB  - One of the guiding principles highlighted in "A Framework for K-12 Science Education" (NRC 2012) states that "children are born investigators," claiming that students construct their own understanding of the natural world even before they learn about it in formal learning settings. Even if students lack a thorough understanding, their curiosity encourages them to ask questions and to consider solutions to problems they encounter. This belief encourages teachers to to cultivate classroom cultures that position students' ideas, knowledge, and abilities first, and encourages them to contemplate scientific and engineering solutions for problems currently facing our society. Toward the goal of creating this classroom culture, teachers have turned to integrated science and engineering curricula that are free and readily available through various online outlets. However, in a recent content analysis study, the authors investigated 52 of these free and readily available lesson activities across four different integrated science and engineering units designed for grade 3-5 students and found a lack of support for the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States 2013) science and engineering practice (SEP) of asking questions and defining a problem. Findings from this analysis suggest that this practice is often overlooked and lessons continue to rely on teacher driven questions or teacher-generated problems. The goal of this article is to consider ways teachers can highlight the practice of asking questions and defining problems within grades 3-5 by making minor adjustments to lessons that have a big impact on encouraging question development.

AB  - Because of a shortage of physical exercise, concerns about adolescents have recently been raised in Taiwan. In educational environments where student exercise has been limited by scheduling constraints and the lack of physical exercise has become a vital problem, "learning while exercising" may be part of a possible solution. This study developed the Ecosystems Augmented Reality Learning System (EARLS) and also made a comparison of EARLS, existing keyboard/mouse-based computer assisted instruction (KMCAI) approaches, and traditional face-to-face teaching methods, in terms of learning achievement and learning attitude. In this study, 1211 subjects were surveyed and divided into 5 groups. Students from the first three groups used EARLS but were exposed to different sections of the system. In terms of learning achievement, learning while exercising groups do not learn less well than the KMCAI or traditional groups. However, they earn extra exercise without diminishing the quality of learning achievement. With regard to the attitude subscales "Usefulness of learning Ecosystems" and "Anxiety in learning Ecosystems", the students in the traditional-teaching group had the significantly lowest scores for both while the students involved in EARLS had the highest ratings on "Usefulness of learning Ecosystems" and the students within KMCAI rated the highest anxiety in learning ecosystems.

AB  - Teaching is acknowledged to be complex, multifaceted and dynamic. Curriculum revisions in Scotland, and elsewhere, call for teachers who are adaptable and capable of change. Yet the skills and attributes traditionally valued and acquired by teachers during their education do not necessarily equip them to cope with the shifting landscape of educational change. This article draws on a collaborative review of literature relating to teacher education, undertaken for the Scottish Teachers for a New Era project. It examines the nature of knowledge for teaching generally and in relation to science education in particular to discuss contested aspects and to develop a conceptual framework for future research and development in this area. The main argument for this study is that a reformulation of teacher education is required. This involves changing the way teachers are educated within an accompanying shift in epistemology and a move to interdisciplinarity. It calls for a more egalitarian way of learning as a means to facilitate change within schools for the creation of a more equal and just society.

AB  - Science education is under revision. Recent changes in society require changes in education to respond to new demands. Scientific literacy can be considered a new goal of science education and the epistemological gap between natural sciences and literacy disciplines must be overcome. The history of science is a possible bridge to link these "two cultures" and to foster an interdisciplinary approach in the classroom. This paper acknowledges Darwin's legacy and proposes the use of cartoons and narrative expositions to put this interesting chapter of science into its historical context. A five-lesson didactic sequence was developed to tell part of the story of Darwin's expedition through South America for students from 10 to 12 years of age. Beyond geological and biological perspectives, the inclusion of historical, social and geographical facts demonstrated the beauty and complexity of the findings that Darwin employed to propose the theory of evolution.

AB  - This study examined an interdisciplinary scientific research project to understand how graduate and undergraduate honors students learn to do science. It was found that the education of the students occurs as part of an apprenticeship. The apprenticeship takes place in research groups. In general, research groups are structured in two ways: loosely organized and tightly organized, and have characteristics of both communities of practice and epistemic communities. Students have different roles in the research groups: novice researcher, proficient technician, or knowledge producer. Their role depends on their knowledge and skills, and their degree programs. It is possible for students to develop expertise along a continuum from novice researcher to knowledge producer. The members of the research group, including the professor and other students, facilitate the development of the students along the continuum of roles. Implications for the education of science teachers are discussed.

AB  - There is increasing enthusiasm for teaching approaches that combine mathematics and biology. The call for integrating more quantitative work in biology education has led to new teaching tools that improve quantitative skills. Little is known, however, about whether increasing interdisciplinary work can lead to adverse effects, such as the development of broader but shallower skills or the possibility that math anxiety causes some students to disengage in the classroom, or, paradoxically, to focus so much on the mathematics that they lose sight of its application for the biological concepts in the center of the unit at hand. We have developed and assessed an integrative learning module and found disciplinary learning gains to be equally strong in first-year students who actively engaged in embedded quantitative calculations as in those students who were merely presented with quantitative data in the context of interpreting biological and biostatistical results. When presented to advanced biology students, our quantitative learning tool increased test performance significantly. We conclude from our study that the addition of mathematical calculations to the first year and advanced biology curricula did not hinder overall student learning, and may increase disciplinary learning and data interpretation skills in advanced students.

AB  - Collaborative problem solving is an essential component of any 21st century science career. Scientists are hired, retained, and promoted for solving problems in dynamic and interdisciplinary teams. They discuss issues, explain and justify their opinions, debate, elaborate, and reflect on their collective knowledge. At the same time, both educational researchers and practitioners note a dissonance between the demands of real-world scientific problem solving and the current educational capacity to prepare effective problem solvers. This article addresses this issue by describing the DEEPER framework for scaffolding collaborative problem solving that was designed to address the student outcomes outlined by the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (2011). The DEEPER scaffolding framework was empirically tested in a large-enrollment undergraduate Entomology course, and although no effects were observed on domain knowledge acquisition or transfer of problem solving, DEEPER served as a useful model for developing the process skills required for 21st century collaborative problem solving.

AB  - The reception of "Ex corde ecclesiae" has been uneven across the disciplines, with scant interest in distinctly Catholic pedagogies outside of the humanities. This essay argues that Catholic universities can distinguish themselves by how they present science and technology in their curriculum by drawing from the interdisciplinary field of "science, technology & society," or STS. We argue that discussions about Catholic identity, science, and human values can and should extend into the curriculum while simultaneously safeguarding academic freedom, and that this can readily be done in professional schools, such as law and engineering. We outline the contributions that STS as a field could offer Catholic higher education. We discuss how teaching science and technologies as social forces can provide the intellectual and reflective space necessary for critical reflection on their moral dimensions, in society and in the emerging professional lives of students. We argue that STS can help Catholic universities express the Catholic tradition of linking knowledge and wisdom, and thus has the potential to advance the distinctly Catholic character of universities. To substantiate our claims, we present three examples of STS in Catholic higher education curriculum: undergraduate core curriculum, law school instruction, and frugal innovation in engineering education.

AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate the progress in operational scientific literacy skills through demonstrating cognition associated with undertaking scientific processes. Scientific literacy is taken here to mean utilising science knowledge and skills, particularly with relevance to creative problem solving and making reasoned decisions in real life situations. The instrument was compiled based on a review of relevant international literature, plus competences emphasised in the Estonian science curriculum. Items in the instrument followed the levels of the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO taxonomy) and all tasks in the instrument were contextualized to relate to real life. A stratified sample of students from 44 schools gave a data set with returns from 1128 beginning of 10th grade students and 946 end of 11th grade students. Findings suggested that there was no sufficient shift from one grade to another in operational skills such as giving scientific explanations, problem solving and justified decision making. Although students did gain more knowledge and the expectation was that students would enhance their operational skills for scientific literacy, this was not reflected in their competence to solve problems. This suggested there was a need to re-think science teaching and learning approaches as well as the manner in which science was introduced to students.

AB  - The Australian Science and Mathematics School (ASMS) is a purpose-built innovative senior secondary school situated on the grounds of Flinders University, South Australia. The school was established to address declining enrollments in senior secondary mathematics and science, students' negative attitudes, a shortage of qualified science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teachers, and a curriculum that lacked relevance to contemporary life. Such research evidence called for transformation in STEM education and acknowledged that teachers' professional learning was central to achieving transformation. A key professional learning strategy employed by the school to transform STEM education was the engagement of teachers and academics as professional partners in developing interdisciplinary curriculum. The value and challenges of the professional partnership are explored in this article, noting the importance of valuing rather than dismissing dissonance between the groups.

AB  - The Maker Movement has taken the educational field by storm due to its perceived potential as a driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation (Honey & Kanter, [Honey, M., 2013]; Martinez & Stager, [Martin, L., 2013]). Making is promoted as advancing entrepreneurship, developing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce, and supporting compelling inquiry-based learning experiences for young people. In this paper, we focus on making as an educative inquiry-based practice, and specifically "tinkering" as a branch of making that emphasizes creative, improvisational problem solving. STEM-rich tinkering activities are designed to support interdisciplinary investigations and creativity using a STEM-rich palette of tools, concepts, and phenomena. To date, the majority of research on making has focused on analysis of makerspaces, maker communities, and design and implementation of maker activities. In this paper, we describe a study that documented dimensions of learning in tinkering programs designed for museum visitors. The study, which was jointly negotiated among a team of researchers and practitioners, led to the development of a Tinkering Learning Dimensions Framework and a publicly available video library of tinkering exemplars, both of which are being actively used by tinkering practitioners in their direct service to the public and professional development work for the field.

AB  - Based on the multidisciplinary field of multimodality, this paper offers a theoretical perspective on the construct of a curricular concept which is commonly used in a school curriculum and applies it to an analysis of a typical curricular text and classroom instruction that exposit the physics concept of work-energy. Theorizing a concept as a network of meaning relationships across multiple modes of representation situated in human activity, this approach examines how we can recognize the meaning constructed through the semantic relationships of language and its contextualization with pictorial, graphical, and numerical resources. The value of this approach to curriculum and instruction in formal educational settings is also presented.

AB  - Modern drug discovery programs require the contribution of researchers in a number of specialist areas. One of these areas is structural biology. Using X-ray crystallography, the molecular basis of how a drug binds to its biological target and exerts its mode of action can be defined. For example, a drug that binds into the active site of an enzyme can inhibit its important biological function and stop the enzyme from working. By understanding this molecular interaction in fine detail, researchers can begin to design new compounds with a view to developing drugs with improved properties, such as better activity and safety. One example of how X-ray crystallography is employed in drug discovery is highlighted in a research project currently underway at the University of Adelaide. A multidisciplinary team of researchers has identified a new class of antibiotics to combat infections caused by pathogenic bacteria, such as "Staphylococcus aureus," the agent responsible for golden staph. Many of the medicines commonly used to treat these infections have become ineffective due to the development of drug resistance. This article describes how the research team is focused on a completely new molecular target in the bacterial cell, Biotin protein ligase (BPL). BPL is an essential metabolic enzyme so inhibitors of this protein should also be effective at preventing the growth of the bacteria. Currently, none of the antibiotics in clinical use exert their activity through this enzyme, so BPL inhibitors represent a completely new class of antibiotic. The article discusses the drug discovery process and the role that structural biology played in that process. It concludes with suggested classroom activities and a list of online resources.

AB  - There is widespread interest among discipline-based science education researchers to situate their research in the existing scholarly literature base. Unfortunately, traditional approaches to conducting a thorough literature review are unduly hindered in astronomy education research as the venues in which scholarship is reported are fragmented and widely dispersed across journals of varying disciplines. The international STudies of Astronomy education Research (iSTAR) online repository is the result of a concerted international community effort to collect and categorize existing research from peer-reviewed journal articles, dissertations/theses, and grey literature. In a "first light" survey of over 300 U.S. dissertations, we find: (i) work in AER dates back to 1923; (ii) the number of extant dissertations is far greater than anticipated; (iii) research methods definitions have evolved; and (iv) most work has studied participants' broad knowledge rather than specific learning targets. The surprisingly wide breadth of rarely cited research motivates us to collect more AER from across international and cross-disciplinary sources.

AB  - In response to the need to prepare students to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century, new models of graduate education are being developed across the country. One model is provided by the National Science Foundation's Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12 Education (GK-12) program, which broadens graduate students' training beyond their traditional research programs. We explored the impact of an ecologically focused GK-12 program at The University of Montana and the broader impacts of a set of other environmental-science-oriented GK-12 programs in the United States. These types of programs are urgently needed to ensure that future leaders of the scientific enterprise are well equipped with the tools to conduct science as skilled collaborators, to address the key interdisciplinary questions that arise from complex environmental challenges facing society, and to better communicate their science with diverse audiences well beyond their scientific peers.

AB  - The need for interdisciplinary graduate training programs which prepare students to conceptualize the application of their research in clinical settings continues to grow. Though several programs have been cultivated to address this need, demand still outweighs supply. The following describes a curriculum developed with the intent of incorporating medical knowledge into a PhD graduate training program. Development of this Molecular Medicine program by the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine in collaboration with Case Western Reserve University was funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute "Med into Grad" initiative. The core curriculum of this program begins with a foundation in Human Physiology and Disease course in which anatomy faculty introduce students to a basic overview of gross anatomy structure and function. This course is followed by five fundamental basic science courses, a composite course focusing on principles of clinical and translation research, a course on laboratory techniques and three, 12-week research rotations. In the second year of the program, students begin their dissertation research, complete their qualifying examination, and partake in an individually tailored Clinical Experience course. Interdisciplinary graduate programs like this provide another venue for faculty in anatomical sciences to help aspiring translational scientists relate basic science knowledge to human pathophysiology and health.

AB  - Actual continuity of the problems stated in this article caused by the fact that modern education is directed at the formation of a mobile person of the teacher, who is able to transform the educational reality and himself in accordance with the requirements of a developing society, and to provide not only high-quality mastering studying the necessary content, but also the development of their personal qualities. The purpose of the article is to develop content-technological aspects of professional mobility of teachers in supplemental education system. The leading methods of research were: interdisciplinary analysis and data synthesis of the philosophical, sociological, natural-scientific, psychological and educational literature; analysis of foreign and domestic psychological and pedagogical experience for the formation of a mobile person in the educational systems; conversation, written survey, interviewing teachers and heads of educational institutions, the method of expert evaluations and self-evaluations; a method of self-managed adults, summarizing these results and ascertaining the formative experiment. The article reveals the essential characteristics (integrity, complementarity, coherence) and structure (personal activity, willingness to perform social roles, adaptability and creativity), formed the conceptual and categorical apparatus of personal mobility, specifications for the detection of the level of its development are proposed, psychological nature of personal mobility the teacher as a value-semantic constructs are disclosed in content and technological aspects of mobility in the system of supplementary education. The results can be used for the organization and implementation of supplementary educational qualification of teacher's development programs.

AB  - Reforms made to France's education system structures during the 1960s resulted in a repositioning of academic subjects within study plans. This article looks at three relatively similar subjects (physical sciences, natural sciences and physical education) and throws light on the arguments put forward to defend the purpose of each of them in the educational process. The arguments provided intended not only to establish each subject's legitimacy from mainly economic, social and political points of view, where the aim was to form the future leaders of a modern society, but also from the academic perspective. Indeed, each subject had to position itself within a changed "hierarchy", giving rise to new interdisciplinary issues which contributed to the transformation of French schools.

AB  - With growing emphasis on data curation practice in both science and industry, there has been a call for information professionals to take on a substantial role in data curation. Library and information science (LIS) education has been responding to this call by offering various training opportunities from Master's education to professional development. The most recent effort to systematically review a data curation curriculum offered by ALA-accredited LIS schools was in 2012, so it is time to revisit the progress and evolution of data curation education. The main goal of this study is to analyze the course content from the syllabi of various programs to understand what is being taught in LIS schools throughout graduate-level education. Further, because the need for data curation is apparent across different disciplines, and thus not only LIS but also other disciplines have been offering data curation courses, this study also analyzed syllabi from other disciplines. A total of 80 syllabi were analyzed in this study: 15 syllabi from 9 ALA-accredited institutions and 65 syllabi from 53 institutions of Carnegie Classification (CC). Our findings suggest a notable growth in LIS education in data curation since 2012, but LIS education still provides less training in technical skills. There was also a distinctive difference in educational approach to teach data curation between LIS (user- and service-oriented) and other disciplines (technical skills-focused), which brought different strengths and weaknesses in curriculum.
