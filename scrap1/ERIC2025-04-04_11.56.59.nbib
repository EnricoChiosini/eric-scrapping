AB  - While a trans-disciplinary approach has been suggested within school science learning to facilitate the role of science education for societal development, lacking is a conceptualisation with respect to what trans-disciplinarity is, why it is needed, and how it can potentially be implemented in the classroom. In seeking to address this limitation, this study undertakes a systematically literature review of research articles published between 2011 and 2022, within the scope of trans-disciplinarity at school level science education. The five key transdisciplinary attributes are identified as -- complexity, liberation, inclusion, transcendence beyond education and reflection, leading to the identification of 12 key dimensions of trans-disciplinarity. Based on this finding, a model is put forward with respect to implementing trans-disciplinarity within school level science teaching-learning, incorporating all identified dimensions as an approach towards addressing wicked problems within the society. The significance of this study lies on the conceptualisation of trans-disciplinarity in a holistic sense, so as to address a wider societal development through school science education.

AB  - The movement from STEM to STEAM, with its emphasis on real-world applications, promises to meet the changing needs of a globally connected world. However, the potential of transdisciplinarity to inspire and deepen our understanding of who we are and how we make sense of a world in turmoil remains undertheorized. This article makes a case for repositioning STEAM education as democratized enactments of transdisciplinary education, where arts and sciences are not separate or even separable endeavors. Drawing upon posthumanist theorizing, three projects will exemplify transdisciplinarity across music, mathematics, and science education. Transgressing and transcending disciplinary boundaries, and attending to both human and nonhuman perspectives, we invite a rethink of the work of schools, going beyond democratizing creativity to fully enact posthumanist transdisciplinarity.

AB  - Natural phenomena and scientific issues are intrinsically interdisciplinary. Students need to study a variety of academic disciplines in the natural sciences to explain a phenomenon or its related problems. Our goal in the current study was to examine the epistemological foundation of students' interdisciplinary understanding of carbon cycling using the supervised latent Dirichlet allocation model. The 454 students in this study were from a public high school and a public research university in Texas. The students' interdisciplinary understanding was shown in each of the constructed response items. In the relationship between the proportion of interdisciplinarity in students' answers to the constructed response items and students' scores on interdisciplinary understanding, all integrations of disciplines were statistically significant in explaining students' interdisciplinary understanding. Moreover, one particular integration set had advantages for obtaining a high score. We found that science coursework contributed to students' interdisciplinary understanding in different ways, and this interdisciplinary understanding was influenced by the number and type of science courses taken. Characterizing interdisciplinarity based on the clusters of science disciplines provided insights into how students synthesize their knowledge. The significance of this study lies in its potential impact on diverse curricular and instructional approaches in interdisciplinary science education.

AB  - While biomedical and life science research have embraced interdisciplinarity as the means to solving pressing 21st century complex challenges, interdisciplinarity in undergraduate education has been more difficult to implement. As a consequence, disciplinary rather than interdisciplinary capstones have become ubiquitous. Disciplinary capstones are valuable for students because they enable them to integrate knowledge and skills within the discipline, but they are also limiting because the integration is within rather than across disciplines. In contrast to a capstone, which involves a single discipline, interdisciplinary capstones require two or more disciplines to combine and integrate across disciplinary boundaries. Interdisciplinarity, where two of more disciplines come together, is difficult to implement in the biomedical and life science curricula because student majors and finances are administered in ways, which reinforce institutional organization of schools and faculties and prevent collaboration. Here in this "idea to explore" we provide an interdisciplinary capstone model where students enroll in disciplinary courses, but then these disciplinary courses and students collaborate on interdisciplinary real-world problems. This interdisciplinary capstone model was implemented across two diverse and large biomedical and life science schools within two faculties in a research intensive, metropolitan university. This approach allows for integration of the biomedical, social and ethical perspectives required when solving problems in the real world, such as COVID-19. Interdisciplinary learning also better prepares students for higher degree research and future careers. Overcoming disciplinary curriculum silos and faculty barriers is critical if we are to meet expectations of acquiring interdisciplinarity as a key competency.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research is gathering increasing support from sustainability scholars, however, there is little dialogue between scholarship on interdisciplinarity and interdisciplinary environmental science education. The aim of this paper is to take stock of the insights of studies of interdisciplinary research to inform environmental research and education. We take as our case study a research centre in Spain, which created an interdisciplinary PhD programme on climate change. The analysis is based on 18 interviews with PhD students and supervisors. We focus on: (1) the need to train experts while redefining expertise outside of disciplinary boundaries; (2) the practical and institutional challenges of interdisciplinarity in the context of PhD training; and (3) the challenges of assessing the quality across disciplines. Our results show that conflicts with institutional requirements lead to a tendency to abandon interdisciplinary aspects and to the training of experts narrowly centred on the specific problem they analyse.

AB  - Despite a key feature of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and a core strength of liberal arts and sciences education, interdisciplinarity is also a noisy buzzword which does not always make sense from an institutional point of view. Traditional interdisciplinary fields take it for granted like fish in the water while, somewhere else, people keep a distance with questions. "Doing" interdisciplinarity faces additional boundary challenges due to strong gravitational forces that are national, historical, and increasingly from between college and workplace. For a higher education institution whose vision for robust interdisciplinarity is rooted across these boundaries, it is not enough to set up a curriculum, hoping that once and for all the train of interdisciplinarity will roar on. In reality, it may take a higher magnitude of interdisciplinarity and constant enabling mechanisms to balance out certain gravitational forces, such as the pro-STEM and pro-exam tendencies in Chinese higher education. This study surveyed the inaugural undergraduate class of Duke Kunshan University (DKU) as well as its undergraduate faculty to propose a theory of change for scaled interdisciplinarity. The resulting theory of change elaborates on an actionable definition of interdisciplinarity using a vocabulary common to college and workplace, a mobility lens for measuring and leveraging different and especially higher magnitudes of interdisciplinarity, and a linchpin mechanism for energizing this mobility so that interdisciplinarity is more entwined with other institutional facets of teaching, learning, and research.

AB  - Contemporary society of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) increasingly requires the education system (i.e., the school) to train competent, creative and proactive professionals who will be able to solve real life problems. If society is to achieve this, some key paradigm changes must occur in education. The school must first prepare a competence-based curriculum and, secondly, school practice should move away from subject-based teaching, towards an interdisciplinary STEM teaching approach. Obviously, to support this, modern learning environments and ICT solutions and tools have to be used. However, since the interdisciplinary STEM approach has already been implemented and integrated, it can be said that a new, integrated science discipline (STEM) has already emerged, together with a transdisciplinary approach to STEM learning and teaching. In the present research, a concrete case of designing, developing and producing a solar chimney was used to demonstrate an integrated approach to learning and teaching, while emphasizing especially the advantages of such an interdisciplinary (transdisciplinary) approach to teaching Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematic content. The empirical research shows that such an approach produces incomparably better results, especially on higher cognitive levels, in comparison to traditional approaches to learning and teaching.

AB  - Data analysis is one of the most popular fields of mathematics and includes statistics and probability. These two mathematical domains are some of the most well-known, influencing everyday life and the various sciences. Their teaching lays the foundation for primary education and culminates in secondary education. Probability and statistics are necessary for today and the future of several professions. This research attempts to highlight the multidisciplinary character of these two disciplines through the textbooks of primary education in Greece and Singapore. It aims to highlight the dependence of mathematics teaching on interdisciplinarity through textbooks. The textbook analysis was chosen because books offer varied learning opportunities. The researchers selected the books, partaking in the comparative analysis. After defining the basic principles dividing lines for the differentiation of the exercises, the analysis was conducted. It included two stages. In the first stage, the activities of the books were examined in their framework application. Then, their interdisciplinary character was accentuated in the scientific field. The results reveal a substantial dependence of data analysis on interdisciplinarity. More interesting is that the distribution of interdisciplinary exercises is prevalent in the scientific milieus.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed significant growth of interest in science-art integration in schools as an approach to creative teaching and learning. This conceptual turn in education implies profound institutional and philosophical changes. Central to this turn has been the development of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math (STEAM) education. In this article, we detail a progression from an existing model of pedagogical principles and educational objectives in science education within a global STEAM education environment, Global Science Opera, towards shared pedagogical principles and educational objectives in both science and arts education within that same environment. In this work, we rely on a transdisciplinary approach towards the integrated disciplines and the educators who teach them. We outline the need for the new, integrated approach to be validated in other, empirical, contexts in order to establish its capacity in the field of creativity in education, and specifically in global STEAM environments in order to ensure its relevance to teaching and learning of a kind which strengthen students' knowledge, abilities and democratic and inclusive values. We propose the Janus metaphor for the new approach as it represents the possibility of having a double perspective of a single focus of attention. We conclude by pointing at limitations of discipline integration in which pedagogical principles in science education are not in harmony with the pedagogical principles in arts education.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity has been touted as a means to recruit more racially and gender-diverse students to computing. In this explanatory sequential mixed-methods study, we investigated demographic characteristics among a sample of undergraduate students pursuing interdisciplinary computing major and minor combinations at 15 institutions in the United States who completed a survey at the end of their introductory course. Descriptive analyses of responses to this survey of introductory computing students revealed that enrollment in interdisciplinary major and minor combinations was limited and did not appear to disproportionately attract women or Black/African American, Latine, Indigenous, and/or Multiracial students. We then conducted a directed content analysis of departmental websites to examine the language and policies that may have precluded or encouraged students to pursue interdisciplinary computing major and minor combinations. Findings revealed that departmental offerings of such programs were limited, and, among those that did offer such programs, communication about their goals and requirements was often lacking. Implications for research and practice, especially as they pertain to efforts to broaden participation in computing, are discussed.

AB  - Systems-level approaches are required for addressing the world's major challenges at the food-energy-water nexus. Taking on complex issues, such as rising food insecurity, malnutrition, and food waste, concomitant with unprecedented levels of stress on environmental systems, will necessitate that future scholars and decision makers be prepared through transdisciplinary student training. However, in higher education, students tend to be siloed within their discipline. In this study, we present a case for the development of transdisciplinary graduate student training based on an inter-institutional and fully remote group of graduate students who assembled during the COVID-19 pandemic to address the issue of food waste. We use our wide-ranging disciplinary backgrounds, high-performance transdisciplinary team training, and stakeholder feedback to develop and conduct a weeklong social media campaign to share educational resources for reducing household food waste. This work offers valuable lessons learned through the student's lens to those seeking to create or improve future transdisciplinary training methods for tackling food waste and other global grand challenges. Key insights from this process include the importance of accountability and open communication when conducting collaborative teamwork, the utility of various mobile and online tools for effectively facilitating remote group work, and the vital role of transdisciplinarity in devising creative solutions.

AB  - Integrating information from across multiple sources is an important science literacy skill that involves the following: identifying intra- and intertextual ties, modeling relationships between sources and claims and making an evaluation of the claims made. Tasks that involve reading, interpreting and synthesizing multiple sources have been well explored particularly in the epistemic cognition literature. Interdisciplinarity is a growing area of interest in science education, in terms of the ways we induct students into interdisciplinary ways of thinking and working, including the synthesis of knowledge from across scientific disciplines. While interdisciplinary contexts frequently involve connecting multiple sources from different disciplines, how students complete these text-integration tasks has not been well investigated. This paper develops a model of interdisciplinary text integration for science literacy, drawing on dimensions of epistemic cognition. We exemplify the application of this approach in a specific case of environmental science graduate students, drawing on student syntheses to illustrate how our approach can be used to differentiate between students' written syntheses.

AB  - Whereas hackathons are widespread within and outside academia and have been argued to be a valid pedagogical method for teaching interdisciplinarity, no detailed frameworks or methods are available for conceptualizing and organizing educational hackathons, i.e., hackathons dedicated to best achieving pedagogic objectives. This paper is dedicated to introducing EDUCational Hackathons for learning how to solve Interdisciplinary Challenges (EDUCHIC) through: (1) defining the fundamental principles for framing an activity as an EDUCHIC, integrating principles from pedagogical methods, hackathon organization, and interdisciplinarity processes; (2) describing general properties that EDUCHIC possess as a consequence of the interaction of the fundamental principles; (3) developing operational guidelines for streamlining the practical organization of EDUCHIC, including an exhaustive end-to-end process covering all the steps for organizing EDUCHIC and practical frames for carrying the key decisions to be made in this process; and (4) a demonstration of these guidelines through illustrating their application for organizing a concrete EDUCHIC.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the extant research on data science education (DSE) to identify the existing gaps, opportunities, and challenges, and make recommendations for current and future DSE. Background: There has been an increase in the number of data science programs especially because of the increased appreciation of data as a multidisciplinary strategic resource. This has resulted in a greater need for skills in data science to extract meaningful insights from data. However, the data science programs are not enough to meet the demand for data science skills. While there is growth in data science programs, they appear more as a rebranding of existing engineering, computer science, mathematics, and statistics programs. Methodology: A scoping review was adopted for the period 2010-2021 using six scholarly multidisciplinary databases: Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and the AIS Basket of eight journals. The study was narrowed down to 91 research articles and adopted a classification coding framework and correlation analysis for analysis. Contribution: We theoretically contribute to the growing body of knowledge about the need to scale up data science through multidisciplinary pedagogies and disciplines as the demand grows. This paves the way for future research to understand which programs can provide current and future data scientists the skills and competencies relevant to societal needs. Findings: The key results revealed the limited emphasis on DSE, especially in non-STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines. In addition, the results identified the need to find a suitable pedagogy or a set of pedagogies because of the multidisciplinary nature of DSE. Further, there is currently no existing framework to guide the design and development of DSE at various education levels, leading to sometimes inadequate programs. The study also noted the importance of various stakeholders who can contribute towards DSE and thus create opportunities in the DSE ecosystem. Most of the research studies reviewed were case studies that presented more STEM programs as compared to non-STEM. Recommendations for Practitioners: We recommend CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISPDM) as a framework to adopt collaborative pedagogies to teach data science. This research implies that it is important for academia, policymakers, and data science content developers to work closely with organizations to understand their needs. Recommendations for Researchers: We recommend future research into programs that can provide current and future data scientists the skills and competencies relevant to societal needs and how interdisciplinarity within these programs can be integrated. Impact on Society: Data science expertise is essential for tackling societal issues and generating beneficial effects. The main problem is that data is diverse and always changing, necessitating ongoing (up)skilling. Academic institutions must therefore stay current with new advances, changing data, and organizational requirements. Industry experts might share views based on their practical knowledge. The DSE ecosystem can be shaped by collaborating with numerous stakeholders and being aware of each stakeholder's function in order to advance data science internationally. Future Research: The study found that there are a number of research opportunities that can be explored to improve the implementation of DSE, for instance, how can CRISPDM be integrated into collaborative pedagogies to provide a fully comprehensive data science curriculum?

AB  - In massive open online courses (MOOCs), recommendation relationships present a collection of associations that imply a new form of integration, such as an interdisciplinary synergy among diverse disciplines. This study took a computer science approach, using the susceptible-infected (SI) model to simulate the process of learners accessing courses within networks of MOOC offerings, and emphasized the potential effects of a network structure. The current low rate of access suggests that a ceiling effect influences learners' access to learning online, given that there are thousands of courses freely available. Interdisciplinary networks were created by adding recommended courses into four disciplinary networks. The diversity of interdisciplinarity was measured by three attributes, namely variety, balance, and disparity. The results attest to interesting changes in how the diversity of interdisciplinary knowledge grows. Particularly remarkable is the degree to which the diversity of interdisciplinarity increased when new recommended courses were first added. However, changing diversity implied that neighbouring disciplines were more likely to come to the forefront to attach to the interdisciplinarity of MOOC offerings, and that the pace of synergy among disparate disciplines slowed as time passed. In the absence of domain experts, expert knowledge is not sufficient to support interdisciplinary curriculum design. More evidence-based analytics studies showing how interdisciplinarity evolves in course offerings could help us to better design online courses that prepare learners with 21st-century skills.

AB  - Among the relevant aspects of the family resemblance approach (FRA), our study focuses on the potential of the approach to elaborate on disciplinary identities in an interdisciplinary context, specifically regarding the interplay between physics and mathematics. We present and discuss how the FRA wheel can be used and intertwined with the framework of boundary objects and boundary crossing mechanisms (Akkerman & Bakker, "Review of Educational Research," 81, 132-169, 2011), which is well-known in STEM education for dealing with interdisciplinarity. The role of the FRA discussed in the article is dual: both practical and theoretical. It is practical in that we show how its use, in combination with the Akkerman and Bakker framework, appears effective in fostering productive discussions among prospective teachers on disciplinary identities and interdisciplinarity in historical cases. It is theoretical in that the combination of the two frameworks provides the vocabulary to characterise the 'ambiguous nature' of interdisciplinarity: like boundaries, interdisciplinarity both separates disciplines, making their identities emerge, and connects them, fostering mechanisms of crossing and transgressing the boundaries. This empirical study reveals how the theoretical elaboration took advantage of the prospective teachers' contributions. We initially presented the FRA to characterise disciplinary identities, but the prospective teachers highlighted its potential to characterise also the boundary zone and the dialogue between physics and mathematics. The data analysis showed that the combinination of the two frameworks shaped a complex learning space where there was room for very different epistemic demands of the prospective teachers: from those who feel better within the identity cores of the disciplines, to those who like to inhabit the boundary zone and others who like to re-shape boundary spaces and move dynamically across them.

AB  - Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is a growing interdisciplinary field addressing exposures to microbial pathogens and infectious disease processes. Risk science is inherently interdisciplinary, but few of the contributing disciplinary programs offer courses and training specifically in QMRA. To develop multidisciplinary training in QMRA, an annual 10-day long intensive workshop was conducted from 2015 to 2019--the Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment Interdisciplinary Instructional Institute (QMRA III). National leaders in the fields of public health, engineering, microbiology, epidemiology, communications, public policy, and QMRA served as instructors and mentors over the course of the program. To provide cross-training, multidisciplinary teams of 5-6 trainees were created from the approximately 30 trainees each year. A formal assessment of the program was performed based on observations and surveys containing Likert-type scales and open-ended prompts. In addition, a longitudinal alumni survey was also disseminated to facilitate the future redevelopment of QMRA institutes and determine the impact of the program. Across all years, trainees experienced statistically significant increases (P < 0.05) in their perceptions of their QMRA abilities (e.g., use of specific computer programs) and knowledge of QMRA constructs (e.g., risk management). In addition, 12 publications, three conference presentations, and two research grants were derived from the QMRA III institute projects or tangential research. The success of QMRA III indicates that a short course format can effectively address many multidisciplinary training needs. Key features of QMRA III, including the inter-disciplinary training approach, hands-on exercises, real-world institute projects, and interaction through a mentoring process, were vital for training multidisciplinary teams housing multiple forms of expertise. Future QMRA institutes are being redeveloped to leverage hybrid learning formats that can further the multidisciplinary training and mentoring objectives.

AB  - Transdisciplinary learning--where students develop and apply knowledge from multiple disciplines to solve open-ended problems--is necessary to prepare students for the most pressing real-world problems. Because transdisciplinary education often requires reimagining the content and design of undergraduate science courses, it can be a challenge for instructors to envision how such work might take place. In this article, we share an example of an undergraduate course developed at the intersection of animal sensory biology and robotics engineering. Students in the course developed knowledge from both disciplines to design a robot that could mimic the sensory behaviors of some animals to achieve a predetermined task. We share examples of students' work in the course and evidence of how students' perceptions of science and engineering changed throughout their participation in the course. Additionally, we describe how we adapted a hybrid model of collaboration that made it feasible for students to work together on an open-ended project requiring access to robotics equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This course can serve as a model for instructors working to incorporate more interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary perspectives into existing science courses.

AB  - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education garnered significant attention in recent years and has emerged as a key field of research globally. The goal of this article is to offer a critical review of how STEM education and its transdisciplinarity were defined and/or positioned in empirical studies published during the early formulation of the field. In particular, we sought to identify how these studies conceptualise learners and learning and portray the underlying assumptions in light of the macrosystemic discourses that often serve as ideological forces in shaping research and practice of STEM education. We examined 154 peer-reviewed articles published between January 2007 and March 2018 and analysed them along several emergent dimensions: their geospatial focus, focal disciplinary areas, methodological and theoretical assumptions, and major findings. Grounded in a critical transdisciplinary perspective, we used critical discourse analysis to identify how macrosystemic and institutionalised forces -- overtly and implicitly -- shape what counts as STEM education research, including its goals and conceptualisations of learners and learning. Our analysis highlights the need for aesthetic expansion and diversification of STEM education research by challenging the disciplinary hegemonies and calls for reorienting the focus away from human capital discourse.

AB  - This study explored primary school teachers' self-efficacy beliefs about interdisciplinary teaching practices related to science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) education and project-based learning to understand teacher perceptions and practices and to recommend some teacher training according to the national curricular standards in Brazil. Qualitative data were gathered using semi-structured interviews carried out with in-service teachers, which were supplemented by a questionnaire featuring both closed-ended and open-ended questions. The data were subsequently subjected to quantitative analysis. The findings reveal that while most teachers are familiar with and incorporate project-based learning into their pedagogical approaches, their awareness of and training in STEAM education are limited. Nevertheless, teachers perceived themselves as being very competent across most STEAM domains, including interdisciplinary curricular integration and projects. Chemistry, physics and arts are exceptions, with lower levels of teacher self-efficacy when compared to the other disciplines. This article examines the implications of these findings for pedagogical practices and teacher training in Brazil, while addressing what are teachers' current perceptions of STEAM practices, encompassing project-based learning and interdisciplinarity. It identifies the training requirements necessary to enhance their confidence in teaching science, while integrating arts-related subjects.

AB  - An expanded investment in interdisciplinary research has prompted greater demands to integrate knowledge across disciplinary boundaries. "Vision and Change" similarly made interdisciplinary expectations a key competency for undergraduate biology majors; however, we are not yet synchronized on the meaning of interdisciplinarity, making this benchmark difficult to meet and assess. Here, we discuss aspects of interdisciplinarity through a historical lens and address various institutional barriers to interdisciplinary work. In an effort to forge a unified path forward, we provide a working definition of interdisciplinary science derived from both the perspectives of science faculty members and scientific organizations. We leveraged the existing literature and our proposed definition to build a conceptual model for an Interdisciplinary Science Framework to be used as a guide for developing and assessing interdisciplinary efforts in undergraduate science education. We believe this will provide a foundation from which the community can develop learning outcomes, activities, and measurements to help students meet the "Vision and Change" core competency of "tapping into the interdisciplinary nature of science."

AB  - By arguing for "putting science education in its place," this essay cautions against overstating the role of science education with respect to global crises with technical components, like climate change. At the same time, it challenges the assumption that science education has no role in addressing equally urgent and widespread problems of oppression, like white supremacy. Putting science education in its place implies considering the potential contributions of science education to the unfinished field of critical pedagogy. This essay takes up this potential in discussion with three contributions in the special issue of this journal commemorating the centenary of Paulo Freire. By highlighting science curriculum that is organized around generative themes, this discussion emphasizes transdisciplinarity as a feature of transformative science education. This discussion also points to counternarratives where cultivating critical consciousness and moving toward collectivism are sources of hope and inspiration in the face of overwhelming challenges to our collective well-being.

AB  - This article explores how global citizenship can be seen in the practices of science education in the context of international education policy and Finnish school and teacher education, with a focus on scientific literacy and sustainability education for promoting a sustainable future. Possibilities of science education to promote sustainability are discussed through teaching examples based on socio-scientific approaches. In addition, transformative science education for sustainability is regarded through competence development taking into account different knowledge dimensions. Solving problems however requires not only knowledge but also communicative and strategic and speculative activity. Thus, education must emphasize the main visions of scientific literacy and transdisciplinary perspectives proposed in the literature, supporting students to understand society and everyday socio-scientific challenges from the local to global level and to deal with differing scientific results and uncertain information. Our article presents findings and conclusions that provide opportunities for further work and provide insights into science and educational sustainability practice.

AB  - Food, cooking, and eating are commonly used as contexts or legitimations to teach and communicate science. However, for teaching to have contextual credibility, the relationship between subject and context is a relevant area of study. The present contribution describes an analysis of curricula from three Nordic countries shedding light on conditions for interdisciplinarity and/or curricular integration between the subjects science/chemistry on the one side, and home economics on the other. A two-phase documentary analysis was conducted on curricula from Finland, Norway, and Sweden from 2006 to 2020, revealing substantial potential for interdisciplinary collaboration and/or curricular integration. This is seen both in common declarative knowledge content ('declarative knowledge overlap') and, more interestingly, meeting points between subject-dependent practices and ways of thinking ('transfer of practices and ways of thinking'). The second inductive phase produced 11 themes common to the subjects. Possibilities and challenges are discussed in relation to the subjects' epistemologies and ontologies, as well as practitioners' competencies, attitudes, and creativity for subject boundary-crossing. Consequently, we conceptualise teachers' roles as lying in the span between 'teacher as polymath' and 'teacher as collaborator'. The present work also provides a instrument for exploring curricular conditions for interdisciplinarity between subjects on a more general basis.

AB  - This study examines interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary interconnections within STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics), the humanities, and their collective impacts on civilizations over time. This study includes a comprehensive overview of STEAM education and its integration with historical context and explores relationships beyond the acronym of STEAM itself, with an emphasis on STEAM advancements, the humanities, and digital citizenship for contemporary learners. The role of humanities in relation to STEAM is considered for delving into the historical background of robotics, the technological evolution from simple machines to complex tools for machine learning, engineering innovations during Industrial Revolutions, the Renaissance for creativity, and the Maker Movement for makerspaces in fostering innovation. The researchers consider how scientific, technological, engineering, and mathematical advancements have shaped societal development, as well as the historical roles of artistic expression on cultures. An analysis of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary connections among STEAM disciplines within historical contexts creates a holistic educational view of societal evolution. The researchers also reflect on the contemporary implications of historical STEAM developments, advocating for the integration of historical context into STEAM curricula -- and STEAM curricula into the humanities -- for cultivating critical thinking, creative thinking, and a deeper understanding of civilization's interconnectedness.

AB  - In this article we present research on Slovenian primary school teachers' opinion about the interdisciplinary approach between fine art and science education. With the help of questionnaires, interviews, and analysis of lesson plans, we determined how primary school teachers use this type of interdisciplinary approach, how often and what their views are. We included 138 primary school teachers from every region in Slovenia. It turned out that primary school teachers in Slovenia use an interdisciplinary approach between fine art and science teaching quite often and consider it useful to achieve different aspects of pupils' development. The study revealed that most teachers find it difficult to consider the educational goals of both fields (fine art, science). They often use the connection between the subjects only on an associative level - they only mention the teaching content of one subject quickly and carelessly, without making meaningful connections and without achieving the goals of both subjects. Content taught in this way cannot be considered a cross-curricular approach in the subject sense.

AB  - Despite its popularity in education studies literature, interdisciplinary science education is mostly considered outside the multitude of social forces that drive education reform. This has contributed to a mythologizing of interdisciplinary science education and lead to assumptions about the necessity of its intervention into science education practice. This research constructs a critical analysis of interdisciplinary science education by exploring a philosophical understanding of the relations between scientific disciplines, investigating discourse about interdisciplinarity in science education policy literature, and provides socioeconomic context for this reform movement. In particular, Louis Althusser's theory of ideology as material force, his conception of the spontaneous philosophy of scientists, and his theses on the ideological nature of interdisciplinary science are foundational to this critique. Althusser's contributions allow for critical reflection on interdisciplinarity and the effects of promoting it throughout scientific enterprise. Viewing interdisciplinary science education through this critical lens allows for demarcating the ideological narratives of reformist discourse from the intended outcomes of reform. This investigation elucidates the intervention of interdisciplinarity as an ideological force governing the reproduction of scientific labor, with intended downstream socioeconomic effects, such as shifting science labor from the public sector to private industry to accommodate for austerity. The conclusions of this analysis advocate for historical materialist methodologies in science education research and critical education studies, while emphasizing the role of ideology in socioeconomic reproduction.

AB  - Scientific literacy requires students to generalise their scientific understanding to contexts beyond the classroom and engage in effective communication. An interdisciplinary approach with the curriculum areas of science and English could address the increasingly complex and multidisciplinary needs of future citizens. This scoping review targets research concerning written argumentation, which is typically positioned as an educational goal or demonstration of learning in English and science education. The systematic literature search process yielded a total of 260 research outputs, with a total of approximately 54,233 participants included across all outputs. Research themes in science written argumentation research were frequently related to content, scaffolding, and instructional style, while English written argumentation research had a more even distribution of research interests, showing a slight inclination for student characteristics and genre. It is clear that argumentation in science education should move beyond a purely objectivist emphasis on facts to a fuller consideration of perspectives, norms, and rhetorical features in English argumentation to further improve the collective scientific literacy of our learners.

AB  - This study responds to the demands of the rapidly changing landscape of education, the 21st century competencies and development of curriculum. Those competences are being interpreted all over the world resulting to differing curricular changes. In the Finnish National Core Curriculum 2016 they are presented as seven transversal competences that guide all subject-specific instruction and must also be addressed through multidisciplinary learning modules. Our analysis aims to connect the relevant curriculum theory and new perspectives to everyday school practices. The perspective is that of the teacher education students: how the student teachers experience the demands and possibilities of the new national curriculum. A science teaching/learning module for promoting the Big ideas of Science education was introduced to them in an out-of-school environment. The results show how confident the student teachers (N = 108) were when facing the challenge of integrating the competences into teaching. The future use of this type of pedagogy was predicted by the Structural Equation path model. The results show that in general integration of the competences was not experienced as hard, but it was more challenging to figure out how to fit them into the daily school routines and timetables.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to describe how a sustainability-focused program in higher education can provide training and key experiences for implementing transdisciplinary approaches. The case is a fieldwork-based training course called the Global Field Exercise (GFE) at the Graduate Program in Sustainability Science, The University of Tokyo. The GFE is a methodological training course that emphasizes generating locally relevant research questions on sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: This research is a case study regarding how a sustainability science program can offer a fieldwork-based training course that focuses on a transdisciplinary approach. Five students from diverse academic disciplines and cultural backgrounds participated in the GFE in QwaQwa where they conducted semi-structured interviews with six local entrepreneurs to identify the challenges and opportunities of entrepreneurship. The authors investigated the learning process and outcomes of the students through participatory observation in preparatory meetings, daily reflection sessions during fieldwork and a content analysis of feedback reports. Findings: Four learning outcomes of the students were suggested: the reexamination of assumptions, managing misunderstanding and miscommunication, mutual learning and being empathic toward the local people. Research limitations/implications: This paper suggests three key opportunistic experiences for the transdisciplinary approach: discuss the normative dimension of sustainability; build intersubjectivity among team members and adopt methodological pluralism; and become empathetic to diverse stakeholder groups to facilitate the cogeneration of knowledge. Originality/value: How to design training on a transdisciplinary approach in educational programs remains an area for further exploration. This study addresses this knowledge gap by establishing a link between sustainability education and sustainability in practice.

AB  - Behind the creativities and innovations in human history, there lie the humble practices of multidisciplinary studies that drive new revolutionary ideas and unconventional approaches. One such example is Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa"--one of the perennial portraits that bear witness to a transcendent level of creative art. It is one of his unique touchstones where he played with light and shade in such a way that both motion and emotion are entwined to the highest point of perfection in the ecstatic smile of the "Mona Lisa." By explaining how Leonardo created an unfathomable emotion in her smile and veiled her face by optics of uncertainty through the fusion of art and science, here we show why and how it can be considered as a prototype for multidisciplinary science education. The analysis of the inner details together with Leonardo's scientific epistemology advocates the importance of putting into practice repeated experiments and observations on widely diverse faculties for the emergence of innovative ideas, for the depiction of reality and for fostering creations.

AB  - We present an investigation into the interdisciplinary role of physics in a physics-for-nonphysicists course at Pomona College. This work is guided by prior research into introductory physics for life science (IPLS) courses, but attends to significant differences in the scope and context of this course. We interviewed enrolled students, physics professors, and professors from nonphysics disciplines to explore the function of this course and the role of physics in the education of nonphysics science students. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed, then analyzed to identify emergent themes. These themes outline the authentic physics, including content knowledge and other, broader learning objectives, that play an important and distinct role in the science education of enrolled students. Stakeholders generally align in their emphasis of interdisciplinary relevance with some divergence in the specific articulation of that idea. The differences can be understood through the stakeholders' distinct areas of expertise, with nonphysics professors expressing value through relevance to their discipline and physics professors focusing on essential aspects of physics.

AB  - The main aim of this paper is to address the increasing need for science-art integration across all levels of education globally. Specifically, the need to identify a signature pedagogy for the Global Science Opera (GSO) that can be used in teaching and learning contexts in formal and non-formal education. This part of the paper draws upon the seminal work of Lee Shulman (2005) to contemplate and propose a signature pedagogy for the GSO. Contemporary ideas from the science-art teaching and learning sources are also used to develop a sound pedagogical foundation for the approach advocated by the GSO. We argue that the development of a signature pedagogy for the GSO provides clarity around the challenge of developing a standard approach to teaching science through art activities. This paper presents the GSO practices that has the potential influence to reshape science teaching and learning process through art.

AB  - The medical education (Med Ed) research community characterises itself as drawing on the insights, methods, and knowledge from multiple disciplines and research domains (e.g. Sociology, Anthropology, Education, Humanities, Psychology). This common view of Med Ed research is echoed and reinforced by the narrative used by leading Med Ed departments and research centres to describe their activities as "interdisciplinary." Bibliometrics offers an effective method of investigating scholarly communication to determine what knowledge is valued, recognized, and utilized. By empirically examining whether knowledge production in Med Ed research draws from multiple disciplines and research areas, or whether it primarily draws on the knowledge generated internally within the field of Med Ed, this article explores whether the characterisation of Med Ed research as interdisciplinary is substantiated. A citation analysis of 1412 references from research articles published in 2017 in the top five Med Ed journals was undertaken. A typology of six knowledge clusters was inductively developed. Findings show that the field of Med Ed research draws predominantly from two knowledge clusters: the Applied Health Research cluster (made of clinical and health services research), which represents 41% of the references, and the Med Ed research cluster, which represents 40% of the references. These two clusters cover 81% of all references in our sample, leaving 19% distributed among the other knowledge clusters (i.e., Education, disciplinary, interdisciplinary and topic centered research). The quasi-hegemonic position held by the Applied Health and Med Ed research clusters confines the other sources of knowledge to a peripheral role within the Med Ed research field. Our findings suggest that the assumption that Med Ed research is an interdisciplinary field is not convincingly supported by empirical data and that the knowledge entering Med Ed comes mostly from the health research domain.

AB  - In this position paper, I examine how the history, philosophy and sociology of science (HPS) can contribute to science education in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. I discuss shortcomings in the ways that history is often used in school science, and examine how knowledge of previous pandemics might help in teaching about COVID-19. I look at the potential of issues to do with measurement in the context of COVID-19 (e.g. measurement of mortality figures) to introduce school students to issues about philosophy of science, and I show how COVID-19 has the affordance to broaden and deepen the moral philosophy that students typically meet in biology lessons. COVID-19 also provides opportunities to introduce students to sociological ways of thinking, examining data and questioning human practices. It can also enable students to see how science, economics and politics inter-relate. In the final part of the paper, I suggest that there are strong arguments in favour of an interdisciplinary approach in tackling zoonoses like COVID-19 and that there is much to be said for such interdisciplinarity in school science lessons when teaching about socio-scientific issues and issues intended to raise scientific literacy.

AB  - : Current research on self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching indicates shortcomings in facing recent teaching challenges in secondary education and corresponding valid instruments. Thus, we designed the Self-Efficacy Beliefs of Interdisciplinary Science Teaching (SElf-ST) instrument based on a pedagogical content knowledge model for science teaching. We ensured the factorial validity of ten factors. To bring construct validity down to a round figure, we examined convergent and divergent validity in this paper. For answering the overall research question regarding arguments for the convergent and divergent validity of the interpretation of the SElf-ST instrument's test values (and related hypotheses), we analyzed data of pre-service, trainee, and in-service biology, chemistry, and physics teachers (n = 590) in a cross-sectional study. While the strong latent correlations of the ten SElf-ST factors with self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching in primary education (r = 0.40 - 0.63, p < 0.01) indicate convergent validity, the rather weak correlations with self-efficacy beliefs of general teaching (r = 0.17 - 0.54, p < 0.01), self-rated content knowledge in science (r = 0.13 - 0.40, p < 0.01), and perceived stress (r = -0.13 - -0.19, p < 0.01) support different divergent validity intensities. Thus, assumed relations within the nomological net surrounding the self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching construct were confirmed for secondary education. In sum, we shed light on a rarely explored aspect of construct validity in science education research regarding self-efficacy beliefs. Doing so, we gained strong arguments that the SElf-ST instrument's test values can serve as indicators of self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching in secondary education.

AB  - The paper investigates how teacher trainees in higher education geography and external, non-scientific partners perceive and experience collaborations in an active teaching and learning approach. Such formats are recommended in education for sustainable development (ESD) but are likely to be challenging experiences for all actors involved. The study analysed two transdisciplinary-oriented courses, where future teachers in geography and primary social and science education collaborated with civil society partners. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 students and partners; course evaluations complemented the database. The analysis identified several approaches to collaboration and aspects that either led to intensive collaboration or challenged its transdisciplinary character. Furthermore, the study revealed the interdependencies between the external partners' expectations, their motives and the perceived effects of the collaborations. The partners anticipated a wide range of expectations, some of which went beyond what the students could reasonably deliver. Our analysis also showed that the collaborations enabled students to learn, experience and reflect on an active teaching and learning approach to ESD. We conclude that transdisciplinary-oriented courses can oscillate along the spectrum between "nice try" and "valuable initiative". The paper ends with recommendations for shaping and delivering transdisciplinary-oriented courses effectively.

AB  - Education research tends to exhibit interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary characteristics. Based on the subject areas in Google Scholar, within the 51 disciplines under social sciences, nine subjects are directly related to education (early childhood education, education, educational administration, educational psychology & counselling, educational technology, higher education, science & engineering education, special education, teaching & teacher education). The interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary characteristics of education research make it difficult for researchers to identify the overall development of specific topics within the field. In this paper, we first collect core papers from the field of education. Then, we construct keyword co-occurrence networks using these papers. Finally, based on the density distribution of keyword co-occurrence networks, we analyse changes in network density at each stage of educational research. Last, we identify the development trends of core topics in the education field. Our main contribution is the quantitative methodological design for examining the hot topics and evolution of education research, which is highly multidisciplinary and covers a large volume of publications.

AB  - Interdisciplinary approach is viewed as the best way to learn about and perceive complex scientific phenomena in the real world; therefore, students need to develop interdisciplinary habits of mind in K-12 science education. This article provided a framework for understanding middle school students' interdisciplinary competence that included four dimensions, each with three performance levels. Science educators have claimed that the current assessment system is still oriented towards single discipline-based science learning. Therefore, this study presented a validated instrument based on our multidimensional construct to explore students' interdisciplinary competence. The participants in this study were 385 9th graders in Henan Province in China. Multidimensional Rasch analysis suggested that this measure had satisfactory reliability and validity. All the students demonstrated the basic level of ability for each dimension. More competent science learners were found to achieve higher ability levels. In addition, students with different scientific proficiencies underperformed in different dimensions. Implications and suggestions for interdisciplinary science teaching and assessment were also discussed.

AB  - The present study sheds light on transdisciplinary education through the application of a scoping literature review, as a lack of a comprehensive synthesis in this area is evident. Thus, the overview frames and outlines the scattered research that has been fulfilled until now in this field. As a result, within transdisciplinary education, medical and adolescent themes form the main scopes, while within sustainable transdisciplinary education, pedagogical design, socio-efficiency, and philosophy are the major themes. Furthermore, the present study contributes to the understanding of transdisciplinary education by highlighting the avenues for future research. Consequently, the translation of transdisciplinary teaching practices to comparable languages and an increase of transparency in the application and reporting of the transdisciplinary design steps are suggested.

AB  - Although undergraduate research experience has proven to have positive effects on student outcomes, such opportunities are not always widely available. Options can be especially limited for early-career engineering students who have limited research experience. One approach to addressing this issue is to partner engineering instructors with active research laboratories to build research experiences into general engineering courses. This article details a collaboration between engineering and chemistry faculty to develop a pipeline of interdisciplinary, research-based projects for second-year engineering students. Chemistry laboratories are a good fit for this approach because they require a wide array of machinery and hardware for experimentation. This work also takes advantage of recent trends toward do-it-yourself labware that has been used with increasing frequency in colleges and universities through expanded access to 3D printing labs. Specifically, we present 3D printing projects as a potential conduit between chemistry and engineering that can enable engineering students to use their design skills to contribute immediately to laboratory projects. Our findings show that this approach allows engineering faculty to meet course objectives while involving students in interdisciplinary research that offers tangible benefits to chemistry laboratories.

AB  - Purpose: The article reconsiders and explicates the role of academia within and for society and suggests quality standards for normative research. Approach: The article analyses and discusses transdisciplinary procedures for citizenship education research in democracies. Findings: Paradigmatic decisions concerning ontology, axiology, epistemology, and methodology need to be made consciously and transparent. This professionalisation is necessary to ensure that the requirements of academic knowledge are met. Furthermore, the social responsibility of research needs to be acknowledged and methodologically taken into account. Implications: The article suggests three main quality aspects for normative research: transdisciplinarity, transparency, and reflection. It emphasises the ethical and epistemological challenges of research in democracies. Hence, there has to be a close focus on structures and power during the research in order to not just create any impact, but good impact.

AB  - Science educators are placing increasing emphasis on the development of students' interdisciplinary competence. This study examined the degree to which disciplinary, cognitive and affective factors could explain students' (N = 385) individual differences in interdisciplinary competence. Multiple linear regression indicated that students' disciplinary knowledge (DK), attitudes toward interdisciplinary approach and interdisciplinary learning opportunities were significant when added to the prediction model. Notably, the results of a semistructured interview and think-aloud session suggested that students' engineering design knowledge was not robust in their responses. Students' feelings toward interdisciplinary learning affected how they mobilized DK to create comprehensive insight into all aspects relevant to the possible solution. Additionally, students' feelings about the interdisciplinary approach influenced their exposure to interdisciplinary issues outside school and engagement in interdisciplinary learning tasks at school, which affected their integration of scientific ideas across disciplines. The results of this study can inform both the movement toward incorporating an interdisciplinary approach into pedagogy and educators and instructors about the factors and possible mechanisms that may shape students' interdisciplinary competence.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify how and why doctoral students do interdisciplinary research. A mixed-methods approach utilising bibliometric analysis of the publications of 195 students identified those who had published interdisciplinary research. This objective measurement of the interdisciplinarity, applying the Rao-Stirling index to Web of Science and Scopus citations, allowed for a comparison of students' interdisciplinary research outcomes from three different computer science programmes: a traditional programme, a multidisciplinary doctoral school and an interdisciplinary doctoral college. Applying a sociocultural approach, interviews with the 15 most interdisciplinary students were analysed to understand how dispositions and experiences of students and factors of the different programmes affect the circumstances and processes of becoming an interdisciplinary early career scientist. The data indicate that student motivations, previous skills and knowledge interacted with policies and programme structures including type of funding and supervisor expectations to play a crucial role in interdisciplinarity at the doctoral level. These factors can give rise to interdisciplinary research even in programmes without interdisciplinary focus and compromise the interdisciplinary goals of interdisciplinary programmes.

AB  - Although one of key ideas behind the introduction of STEM (or STEAM) as a unifying concept, is to emphasize the interdisciplinary character of many real world problems, there is a non-trivial educational challenge in exceeding existing subject boundaries and implementing multidisciplinary activities into the classroom. The present case study covers the design, implementation and evaluation of a multidisciplinary unit in a Finnish lower secondary school, grade 9. The entire multidisciplinary unit was organized around the central concept of energy, and the present study focuses on an activity within that unit that explored how energy can be used to analyze both living and non-living systems. Evaluation of the activity was done with pre and post student questionnaires, analyzing the students' written poster presentations and focus group interviews done with a voluntary group of students after the whole unit. The aim of the study was to explore how students understand the multidisciplinary character of the energy concept. Our results show both challenges and possible gains of working in a multidisciplinary way. However, to succeed serious thought has to be invested in both identifying core concepts that gain by being analyzed in an interdisciplinary way, and in the design of appropriate learning activities around these core concepts. Our study is as an effort in this direction.

AB  - Despite growing advocacy of interdisciplinary approaches to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), there are persistent concerns about the practical and principled epistemic bases on which this can be justified as a mainstream curricular practice. A major issue concerns the nature of interrelations between the STEM disciplines in interdisciplinary work. In the paper, we argue that the spatial metaphor prevalent in discussions of interdisciplinarity, and boundary crossing, while useful, has limitations in capturing the challenges and possibilities for interdisciplinary STEM in schools and in some respects misconstrues the cultural and historical nature of disciplinary epistemic practices. We argue, as a contribution to a theory of interdisciplinary curricular practice, that key issues for such practice can be productively seen through a temporal metaphor and that a temporal model can usefully inform schools and teachers in framing and supporting student learning in interdisciplinary settings. To illustrate this, we use indicative cases from two major Australian STEM initiatives to examine temporal relations between mathematics, science and technology, at the micro-, meso- and macro-levels, and the implications of this for disciplinary integrity. Finally, we argue that contemporary interdisciplinary advocacy amounts to a challenge to renew epistemic traditions in the STEM subjects.

AB  - In an academic semester, living in social isolation and under restrictions of the pandemic, we organized weekly multidisciplinary seminars from a postgraduate course program in Curitiba, Southern Brazil, integrating students from different regions of Brazil and South America. Outstanding researchers from Brazil, Germany, France, Argentina, Mexico, Portugal, England, and United States' institutions gave seminars on chronic and infectious diseases with immunological, pharmacological, biochemical, cellular, and molecular biology point of views. The meetings were longer than traditional seminars, containing a part with scientific debate and other with a humanization or deconstruction of the researcher including trajectory, hobbies, scientific, and social thoughts. To facilitate learning and conceptualization, the seminars were available through YouTube and we applied weekly questionnaires to be answered rescuing scientific and motivational topics to give companionship and support to the students in pandemic times. Here, we are defending the creation of permanent platforms for scientific diffusion, with higher accessibility, connecting centers of different levels and giving academic excellence and opportunities for young researchers. Feedback received from participants indicates that this seminar structure can increase confidence and improve their perception of scientific processes and inspire researchers with development trajectories. We have discussed multidisciplinarity, scientific excellence, regional isolation and economic inequality, integration, humanization, and the value of science in society.

AB  - This article examines an outdoor science activity based on Interdisciplinary Teaching and Learning of Science (ITLS) undertaken with a collaborative research methodology as a Research-Practice Partnership (RPP). The activity was implemented in a national reserve in Chile as part of continuing professional development and co-designed by in-service science teachers and researchers. The study had two research questions: 1) How do in-service teachers, working in a RPP, connect and articulate different science topics through methodological and theoretical interdisciplinary perspectives? 2) Can a RPP be a pedagogical resource to generate positive changes in professional development within the practice of managing outdoor science activities? The analysis was qualitative and based on content analysis of data collected from questionnaires about the teachers' perceptions and scientific posters designed by the teachers as part of their course. Teachers were able to connect interdisciplinary topics -- using theoretical and methodological interdisciplinarity -- to solve real problems that arise from the environment within a field trip. In addition, findings reveal benefits of RPP and ITLS, for the management of outdoors activities, supporting the importance and relevance of learning science outside the classroom. However, the boundaries between researchers and science teachers should consider the cultural worlds of participants in the partnerships.

AB  - Research Reproducibility: Educating for Reproducibility, Pathways to Research Integrity was an interdisciplinary, conference hosted virtually by the University of Florida in December 2020. This event brought together educators, researchers, students, policy makers, and industry representatives from across the globe to explore best practices, innovations, and new ideas for education around reproducibility and replicability. Emphasizing a broad view of rigor and reproducibility, the conference touched on many aspects of introducing learners to transparency, rigorous study design, data science, data management, replications, and more. Transdisciplinary themes emerged from the panels, keynote, and submitted papers and poster presentations. The identified themes included lifelong learning, cultivating bottom-up change, "sneaking in" learning, just-in-time learning, targeting learners by career stage, learning by doing, learning how to learn, establishing communities of practice, librarians as interdisciplinary leaders, teamwork skills, rewards and incentives, and implementing top-down change. For each of these themes, we share ideas, practices, and actions as discussed by the conference speakers and attendees.

AB  - Recently, there has been a trend towards adding a multidisciplinary or multicultural element to traditional monodisciplinary project courses in computing and engineering. In this article, we examine the implications of multidisciplinarity for students' learning experiences during a one-semester project course for real customers. We use a qualitative research approach and base our analysis on students' learning reports on three instances of a project course titled "Multidisciplinary working life project". The main contribution of this article is the unified theoretical picture of the learning mechanisms stemming from multidisciplinarity. Our main conclusions are that (1) students generally have a positive view of multidisciplinarity; (2) multidisciplinary teams enable students to better identify their own expertise, which leads to increased occupational identity; and (3) learning experiences are not fixed, as team spirit and student attitude play an important role in how students react to challenging situations arising from introduction of the multidisciplinarity.

AB  - Increasingly pervasive digital technologies in societies are placing complex demands on the development of young people's digital citizenship and digital competence. Social science education and teacher education (TE) play important, but poorly understood, roles in this development. Through reflexive thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews, this paper explores 15 Swedish teacher educators' (TEDs) views of teaching for digital citizenship, particularly social science TE's role. We also consider organisational and personal conditions that may influence TEDs' views of professional digital competence (PDC) for such teaching. Their views are examined through a postdigital lens, with a focus on democratic implications in evolving socio-technical environments. The results indicate that TEDs acknowledge the importance of social science TE in teaching for digital citizenship, but find maintaining responsiveness to societal changes challenging. Challenges are also posed by the multidisciplinary character of social science education, including how personal trajectories shape TEDs' views of their dual-didactic task of teaching to teach for digital citizenship. This paper contributes knowledge of how TEDs, as 'street-level bureaucrats' in social science TE, navigate between written and performed education policy in teaching for digital citizenship, with specific attention to the dynamic character of PDC in social science education.

AB  - Educational phenomena and child development fascinate many disciplines for which they offer a tremendous field of experimentation and application. More than a hundred years ago, when educational sciences adopted the main institutional emblems of an academic discipline (chairs, diploma, laboratories, scientific network etc.), they obviously vacillated between the dream of becoming a unified science (as pedology testifies), and the claim of a rewarding pluridisciplinarity that could synergise all disciplines concerned with the child and with education. This paper asserts that the issue of pluridisciplinarity is constitutive for the development of sciences of education whose object is ever coveted by other disciplines. The first section adopts the point of view of a social history and, on the basis of voluminous archives, it describes the main lines of the shaping of this pluridisciplinary field in Geneva, representative of that which also occurs elsewhere. In the second part, it presents a more theoretical reflection on the tensions and pitfalls of what we call the "process of disciplinarisation" of educational sciences, outlining the characteristics of this constitutively pluridisciplinary field.

AB  - The introduction of Green Chemistry (GC) into school science curriculum is considered an important step that encourages students to build connections between chemistry, other school subjects, and different aspects of their daily lives. The concepts associated with GC can be applied throughout the various levels of education with different degrees of complexity and provide a systematic approach to the teaching of science for sustainability. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the specific content that can be associated with the teaching of GC in primary and secondary schools in Chile. This study aims to provide a model of curricular science content for GC school education, utilizing the framework of Educational Reconstruction. The research question was "What links do in-service science teachers and science education researchers establish between GC and the school curriculum?" Specifically, we were interested in comparing science teachers' and science education researchers' perceptions of the links between GC and school science subject, school science contents, and crosscutting science concepts. A qualitative approach was employed for data collection and analysis, focusing on the written responses of 20 in-service science teachers and 20 science education researchers. We conclude the study by proposing an empirically based model of curricular content for GC school education (GCSE), comprising three dimensions: the multidisciplinary dimension of school science subjects represented here by chemistry, with the greatest presence, biology, physics, and geology; the intradisciplinary dimension of core disciplinary contents within each school subject; and the interdisciplinary dimension linked to a range of crosscutting concepts for GC.

AB  - A large number of articles in the field of science education reflect on scientific literacy as the main goal of science education (SE), although often with varying viewpoints. Nevertheless, researchers have begun to highlight subject-specific teaching practices that are expected to specifically enhance science subject teaching, including biology. The main aim of this theoretical article is to come on consensus and to conceptualise the term biological literacy (BL) more clearly and to present a theoretical concept of BL, composed on the basis of systematically analysed articles. This theoretical concept includes two dimensions of BL: (1) cognitive (cognitive skills, conceptual understanding, biological inquiry) and (2) affective dimension, based on systematic literature review (SLR). This theoretical concept also includes in addition four dimensions of BL: (3) sustainability; (4) interdisciplinarity, (5) career awareness and (6) nature of biology (NOB), based on literature review (LR) of recent decades, that was conducted to write theoretical overview of this research.

AB  - Interdisciplinary collaborations between different academic disciplines can create knowledge and solutions to challenges that are beyond the scope of what a single discipline can achieve. However, little is known about how interdisciplinary teams of faculty and graduate students function as a whole and the processes that guide them as they work on collaborative tasks. Using Activity Theory, this qualitative study analyzed team meeting transcripts to examine interdisciplinary team interactions involving Science/Engineering and Science Education graduate students and faculty members as they co-developed laboratory activities for a grant-funded project. Several factors contributed to the team's success: shared goals (Object), environment (Community), and clear Division of Labor. Differences (contradictions) were found in the Tools, Rules, and Division of Labor; the PI and Science/Engineering graduate students tended to focus on the needed lab materials, and the Science Education members focused more on educational standards and teachers' ideas in the lab development (Tools). The PI and Science Education members set and enforced the team meeting agendas and deadlines (Rules). The Science/Engineering grad students focused on practical considerations to ensure the labs could successfully be implemented in a class setting (Rules) and were assigned the most tasks to complete (Division of Labor). The findings provide insight into the nature of interdisciplinary team dynamics between a Science/Engineering and Education grant team. The findings also suggest the importance of shared goals (Object), community development (Rules: Team Building), and the potential of capitalizing on different strengths and knowledge (contradictions) in an interdisciplinary team.

AB  - Creating learning environments that integrate arts, sciences, and computing in education can improve learning in these disciplines. In particular, transdisciplinary integrations of these disciplines can lead to expansive alterations or dissolutions of epistemological, ideological, and methodological boundaries. We wish to support teachers in the creation of transdisciplinary learning environments that draw on art, science, and computing. We developed a classroom project genre, Luminous Science, that was designed to bridge disciplinary materialities, epistemologies, and representations through students' construction of computationally-rich representations of physical phenomena. We present a study of a multidisciplinary group of teachers co-designing a Luminous Science unit for their classrooms using sculptural lanterns with programmable media for both investigations and expressions of classroom gardens. We present a framework for examining what disciplinary understandings teachers drew on, how these ideas were utilized, and why they were brought together. We found teachers engaged in richly metarepresentational discussions wherein they applied values, epistemic criteria, and practices from all three constituent fields of study in their design work. We show how teachers developed units that simultaneously overlapped and diverged due to the pressures of navigating disciplinary and school structural challenges. Qualitative analysis of teacher discourse reveals how teachers liberated disciplinary boundaries, actively and critically explored synergies and tensions in disciplinary integration, and traversed goals that focused on both disciplinary improvement and holistic learning. Our study sheds light on how we can both study teachers who are designing for disciplinary integration and support them through professional development opportunities to encourage more transdisciplinary interactions that can expand what it means to do or teach art, science, and computing.

AB  - A subject worth examining was the interdisciplinary approach's planning and application of two distinct disciplines and investigating the value acquisition inclinations of students who participated in the multidisciplinary approach. In this context, the problem sentence of the research is that: Does integrate mathematics and life sciences teaching have an effect on primary school 3rd-grade students' acquisition of honesty, respect, love, and helpfulness values?". The impact of integrated Mathematics and Life Sciences teachings in third grade on students' honesty, respect, love, and helpfulness value dispositions was studied using a quasi-experimental method with a pretest-posttest control group and the theme of "tolerance." As the data collection tools of the research, the "Honesty Value achievement Scale," "Love achievement Scale," "Respect achievement Scale," and "Helpfulness achievement Scale" was applied to the students in the sample. This research was conducted in three stages: preliminary preparations before application, integration of disciplines, lesson plan preparation, and actual application. There was a significant difference in favor of the experimental group when comparing students taught integrated mathematics and life sciences versus retrained students using a Ministry of National Education-approved course and workbook. In addition, there was a significant difference in favor of the post-test between the pretest-posttest scores of the honesty, respect, love, and helpfulness values belonging to the students in the experimental group taught integrated mathematics and life sciences.

AB  - The Prospect Park Biodiversity Project was a SENCER collaboration project between the Departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry, and Mathematics at the New York City College of Technology. The goal of this project was to enhance students' participation and learning in STEM disciplines through a civically engaged framework. The project utilized the eco-complexity of Prospect Park Lake in Brooklyn, New York for an interdisciplinary study on the water quality. The project, which involved ten students and four faculty mentors, integrated microbiology, chemistry, and mathematics perspectives using active-learning pedagogies, including hands-on exploration and collaborative learning.

AB  - This open access edited volume invites transdisciplinary scholars to re-vision science education in the era of the Anthropocene. The collection assembles the works of educators from many walks of life and areas of practice together to help reorient science education toward the problems and peculiarities associated with the geologic times many call the Anthropocene. It has become evident that science education--the way it is currently institutionalized in various forms of school science, government policy, classroom practice, educational research, and public/private research laboratories--is "ill-equipped" and "ill-conceived" to deal with the expansive and urgent contexts of the Anthropocene. Paying homage to myopic knowledge systems, rigid state education directives, and academic-professional communities intent on reproducing the same practices, knowledges, and relationships that have endangered our shared world and shared presents/presence is misdirected. This volume brings together diverse scholars to reimagine the field in times of precarity.

AB  - There is growing recognition of the importance of engaging postsecondary students in experiences that challenge them to solve complex socioscientific problems, transdisciplinary in nature, requiring students to integrate and synthesize knowledge, skills, and ways of thinking across disciplinary boundaries. Yet these student experiences are atypical. One possible reason is that the cross-disciplinary collaborations of faculty needed to create meaningful transdisciplinary student experiences are likely to be challenging. Lacking insight into these novel collaborations, we conducted a phenomenological study that describes faculty experiences across multiple disciplines and institutions to develop a transdisciplinary curriculum. Faculty were motivated by their professional development needs and a desire to improve their teaching practices and to develop curricula that would enhance student learning, all around a topic of personal interest. Yet faculty experienced tensions related to navigating norms, practices, and language across disciplines, the suitability of transdisciplinary curricula to their courses, and confidence in teaching across disciplines. Project leaders were essential facilitators and codevelopers, helping to alleviate some tensions. We discuss implications for faculty, academic leaders, administrators, and other stakeholders interested in involving faculty working across disciplines to develop transdisciplinary curricula, notably around a timely and important topic in the biological sciences.

AB  - This article seeks to provide a framework for recognizing and realizing the pedagogical potential of arts-science integration in early childhood. Herein, I present five ways of positioning arts vis-à-vis science and associate them with different learning opportunities. I have analyzed if and how these positionings come into play in teachers' documentation of arts-science projects conducted in eight Swedish preschool groups (children aged 1 to 5 years). These teachers positioned arts and science as "disciplinary distinct" (associated with acquiring and communicating knowledge in the respective subjects), as "multifaceted" (producing multidimensional knowledge), and as "entangled" (empathizing with human and nonhuman others). In addition, I discuss if and how teachers can position arts and science as "inquiry oriented" (investigating and identifying patterns) and "disciplinary transcendent" (solving problems in transdisciplinary ways). I suggest that teachers draw on these findings to plan and analyze integrated arts-science education in practice.

AB  - In this article, the authors describe critical issues related to the pursuit of rigorous and innovative research in the fields of mathematics and science education. The paper is framed to help researchers consider aspects of both their research project and their research proposal. The authors describe features of high-quality and fundable research projects and whether the research is intended to support descriptive, design-oriented, or causal interpretation. They discuss the critical role of grounding proposed research in existing literatures; attending to relevant research from associated fields; and posing research questions that are clear, specific, and feasibly addressable. The goals of the research should cohere with the methodological and analytic design proposed. The authors also discuss the multidisciplinary nature of research that has implications for practice in general and for educational practice more specifically. The authors touch on the characteristics of more and less successful interdisciplinary research teams, especially those that draw from education, cognitive science, methodology, educational psychology, the learning sciences, and relevant STEM disciplinary fields. Examples of STEM education research questions from different genres of research are considered and the authors describe how the questions themselves give rise to specific design choices, methodologies, measures, study samples, and analytical models as well as how they can reflect the disciplinary orientations of the researchers. Implications of these issues for successful educational research grant proposal writing are discussed.

AB  - Transformational equity-centered science education requires the fields of science education and school leadership to critically consider the limited preparation elementary principals are offered to lead for science education. Thus far, little effort has been made to foster a transdisciplinary curricula beyond traditional organizational theories related to school culture and climate; learning sciences; and supervision. School leadership programs are currently inadequately preparing elementary leaders in rigorous pedagogies involving science education. Although the role of principals is often not discussed concerning science implementation in elementary education, principals play a critical role in science decision-making. In this study, the authors present a case study of one elementary principal who also served as an othermother. Othermothers have been described as those who share mothering responsibilities in Black communities. Through interview transcripts, field notes, and social network data, the authors examine how this othermother cared for her students and community by advocating for science instruction. By strategically navigating the socio-political and policy climate and drawing on her authentic relationships, this othermother was critical in implementing a science agenda for elementary science. Three themes that emerged from the data analysis are, (1) othermothers view science as a potential means to transform lives and fulfill the needs of the local community, (2) science policies (i.e., federal, state, and local) can limit the potential of the vision of science an othermother has for the community, (3) othermothers draw on their community to guide equitable science instruction. Overall, othermothers have visions for what science can do. However, they cannot counter the status quo individually. Collective action among educators in various roles is one means of moving an equity agenda concerning science education forward.

AB  - Research into Australian students' science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) engagement has highlighted that there are comparably fewer women enrolling in STEM programs and working in STEM industries. In Australia, males make up 84% of the total population with STEM qualifications, for example, a report in 2015 found only 13% of all engineers in Australia were women. Science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM), an approach to STEM education that encourages interdisciplinarity, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship, is a strategy that has the potential to increase girls' engagement with STEM. This research investigated the impact of the STEAMpunk Girls Program, funded by the Australian Government, on high school girls' learning and their teachers' teaching experiences. The program uses project-learning and design thinking strategies to enable the girls to gain confidence in themselves as change-makers with the capacity to generate solutions to real-world problems. Using a mixed method approach, the findings indicated that teachers and students were positive about the STEAMpunk Girls' experience, with significant increases in confidence and motivation in the girls at the end of the program.

AB  - Background: In responding to the global problems facing humankind, there is great value in equipping science and engineering students with skills to function well in multidisciplinary teams. Little attention has been paid into the factors that influence multidisciplinary collaboration and teamwork of science and engineering students. Purpose: This research describes multidisciplinary teamwork of applied physics and mechanical engineering students in a challenge-based learning (CBL) course. The study aimed to: a) identify the facilitators and barriers to multidisciplinary teamwork and b) explore learning outcomes connected to working in multidisciplinary teams. Sample: 30 students registered to the course, two teachers, and three tutors participated in this research. Design and Methods: An instrumental case study was conducted in the context of a pilot CBL course. Data included interviews, reflection reports, observations, and design posters. Transcribed video recordings were searched in an attempt to demonstrate the codes revealed with the qualitative content analysis of interview transcripts and reflection reports. Results: The results indicated knowledge acquisition, application, and an awareness of other disciplinary approaches as the learning outcomes with some differences for engineering and physics students. The findings also yielded individual (e.g. knowledge of control theory), team (e.g. disciplinary perspectives), and course factors (e.g. disciplinary connections to the challenge) that influenced multidisciplinary teamwork. Conclusion: Multidisciplinary teamwork is supported by the unique ways of thinking and approaching problems of the two disciplines. Implications contribute to future research and thinking for similar learning environments while improving student learning in multidisciplinary teams.

This study focused on ways in which embodied arts-based experiences offer opportunities for such engagement in pedagogical efforts associated with justice-centered science. The conceptual framework that informed the study considers the body as a site of learning, embraces social justice in science education and engages with the dialectical relationship between various structures and children's agency, and frames the transdisciplinarity of imagination. The instrumental case study centered on a fifth-grade class of Latinx students in an urban public school, as they grappled with lead contamination and peoples' rights to clean water through an embodied, arts-based pedagogy in their science class. Analysis of video clips, student work, and other artifacts pointed to three findings on how children engaged with justice-centered science learning via arts-based embodied activities. Through perspective-taking in the dramatizing, children engaged with science ideas intertwined with sociopolitical understandings. Through centering emotions that drama afforded, children experienced empathy and solidarity with others affected by environmental injustices. Through imagined and enacted participation in struggles that the embodiments necessitated, children engaged in actions to resist injustices. These findings suggest that exploring children's arts-based embodied meaning making in science is a robust area of inquiry. Furthermore, the findings compel researchers and practitioners to consider emotions in performing arts, and how they can deepen engagement in, and exploration of, justice-centered science. Recommendations emerged for practitioners poised to explore justice-centered science with children through the arts.

AB  - STEM education and research has gained popularity internationally over the last decade. However, there is a lack in specifications in existing K-12 STEM classroom observation protocols of how features of an integrated STEM experience/lesson would lead to desired outcomes and how those outcomes should be measured. To bridge this gap, we propose the development of a new integrated STEM classroom observation protocol (iSTEM protocol). This article describes the ongoing development work of the iSTEM protocol, which features two creative attempts. Firstly, the productive disciplinary engagement framework is adapted to design a classroom observation protocol that provides a coherent frame of design principles to be met to achieve desired 3-dimensional pedagogical outcomes. Secondly, "interdisciplinarity" of student engagement was interpreted in terms of the extent to which students take a systematic and disciplinary-based approach to make and justify decisions during STEM problem-solving. The iSTEM protocol comprises 15 items (4-point scale) rated holistically for the extents to which evidence was found in the observed lesson for (1) the 3-dimensional pedagogical outcomes of productive interdisciplinary engagement (five items) and (2) problematising, resources, authority, and accountability design principles (10 items). The accompanying iSTEM profile visually represents and communicates the strengths and inadequacies in design principles, thus providing explanations for extents of students' productive interdisciplinary engagement. The iSTEM protocol will contribute as a research tool for STEM education researchers and as a pedagogical guide for STEM classroom teachers to improve their design of STEM learning experiences.

AB  - This paper, the third in a series on Earth System Science Education, describes various pedagogical ways forward when science teachers are addressing the curriculum implications of the recent interdisciplinary field of Earth System Science (ESS). Parts I and II introduced the key ideas of ESS and the implications for the Australian Curriculum: Science (see "Teaching Science" 68.1 & 68.2 respectively). Part III outlines several research-informed pedagogies to help learners develop more scientific understandings of the Earth System and appropriate related abilities. We believe the suggested ESS additions, emphases and the recommended pedagogies could comprise one pathway toward a more comprehensive and confident Earth System literacy and a stronger engagement in the Earth and other sciences at every school level, and to the curriculum as a whole. Better-informed, sustainability decision-making and actions by students as today's, and tomorrow's, citizens are the hoped-for outcome. [For Part II, see EJ1355521.]

AB  - This paper examines shifts in the knowledge production policy agenda at Japanese research universities -- a transition from discipline-based academic tradition towards interdisciplinary forms of knowledge production -- through a case study of a leading interdisciplinary research institute. We examine this transition through the case of Tohoku University, one of seven 'Designated National Universities', and its flagship International Research Institute of Disaster Science. Documentary analysis revealed a renewed emphasis on interdisciplinarity, evident in restructuring towards a 'blended hybrid' model to reconcile the different institutional logics of diverse research traditions among its staff. Interviews with key stakeholders uncovered the internal dynamics of this process, its barriers and opportunities. We conclude with implications for Japanese higher education, arguing that a shift to 'blended hybrid' institutional forms is necessary but insufficient to maintain successful interdisciplinary research institutes. Success is contingent on simultaneous commitment to sustainable international connections and relationships with diverse external stakeholders.

AB  - The way science education is positioned and practised in New Zealand primary schools varies widely. In this qualitative case study, participants in senior management from five Auckland primary schools were asked how they perceived science, how it was taught and reasons for the pedagogical approaches chosen. It was clear all schools were different in terms of population and the pedagogical approaches used to teach science. Science was taught in a range of configurations--from siloed to transdisciplinary integrative approaches and by classroom teachers, specialists and outside providers. The schools in this study who saw 'science as everywhere' and practised collaborative teaching were more likely to teach science through integration.

AB  - Background: Argumentation, that is the coordination of evidence and reasons to support claims, is an important skill for democratic society, developing subject-specific literacies, and can be embedded in multiple school subjects. While argumentation has been extensively researched in science education, interdisciplinary argumentation is less explored, particularly between subjects where collaboration is not the norm, such as science and religious education (RE). Yet everyday issues often involve considering information from multiple sources, such as scientific information or ethical, moral, or religious perspectives. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to better understand students' abilities in argumentation within and across the school subjects of science and RE to inform research and practice of interdisciplinary argumentation. Sample: The participants of this study were 457 students, aged between 11 and 14 years, from 10 secondary schools in England. Following data cleaning, 394 student responses were analysed. Design and Methods: Students completed simultaneous written assessments for argumentation in three tasks which are situated within three different subject contexts: (1) science (2) RE, and (3) an interdisciplinary context which involved argumentation from science and RE. Results: In each of the three contexts, high proportions of students achieve all available marks for identifying claims and evidence. These proportions drop when constructing the link between claim and evidence (warrant) and constructing an evaluative argument. Higher performances were generally noted in the context of science and that students experience particular challenges in argumentation in the RE scenario. Conclusions: This study contributes to our understanding of the challenges and successes of students' argumentation within and across the subjects of science and RE. Implications for both research and practice are discussed.

AB  - This article aims to explore the experiences of science instructors who are active participants in the design and enactment of an interdisciplinary science course with student-centered pedagogy in a large-enrollment class. The data were collected through interviews with instructors and analyzed using the inductive thematic approach. Results show that the instructors discussed the benefits and challenges of using the previous passive-lecture format of the science course. Instructors believed that even though the previous format is easy to implement, it does not help students understand how scientists approach complex problems. In the new approach, the instructors prepared learning objectives to address expected learning outcomes. They integrated diverse research-based instructional strategies to enhance students' learning and interest in science but encountered some challenges. The instructors' experiences illustrate that planning and enacting an interactive science learning with an interdisciplinary approach is possible in undergraduate science education with appropriate support. The findings of this study can be a model for other universities to initiate changes in science instruction.

AB  - The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), a reform effort "for states, by states," advances ambitious ideals for elementary science teaching, but the fate of these ideals will depend in part on the engagement of state science coordinators (SSCs). This article explores the responses of SSCs to NGSS in a purposeful sample of 18 US states. Based on analysis of 19 interviews with 22 SSCs, we develop two arguments. First, SSCs' ideas about improving elementary science education converged around three themes: the introduction of three-dimensional science teaching and learning, the integration of engineering with science teaching, and the integration of science with ELA and mathematics. Second, SSCs' sense-making about reforming elementary science education was situated in and shaped by (a) their knowledge of how elementary science instruction has been and continues to be de-prioritized, as well as their experiences (b) facilitating work groups in developing science standards using the Framework for K-12 Science Education, and (c) participating in professional networks.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: This paper explores the potential value of critical thinking in computer science education and discusses strategies for its integration across the curriculum. Background: As technology rapidly evolves and becomes increasingly integrated into society, there is a growing need for computer science graduates who can think critically about the ethical, societal, and technical implications of their work. Methodology: This study employs a conceptual analysis approach, reviewing existing literature on critical thinking in computer science education and synthesising insights from various sources. The analysis focuses on identifying challenges in implementing critical thinking instruction and proposing practical solutions. Contribution: This paper provides an overview of the current discourse on integrating critical thinking into computer science curricula. It explores the distinction between critical thinking and computational thinking, discusses various pedagogical approaches, and offers insights into potential challenges of implementation. Findings: The paper identifies six key challenges in embedding critical thinking into computer science education. It proposes initial steps to address these challenges, including curriculum redesign, innovative assessment methods, and faculty development strategies. Recommendations for Practitioners: Educators should adopt a balanced approach that complements technical education with critical thinking exercises, using diverse teaching methods such as dialogue-based teaching and authentic instruction. Recommendation for Researchers: Future research should focus on empirical studies to assess the effectiveness of the proposed solutions and develop standardised tools for evaluating critical thinking skills in computer science. Impact on Society: By enhancing critical thinking skills in computer science education, we can produce graduates who are better equipped to address complex technological challenges and their societal implications. Future Research: Further investigation is needed into the most effective pedagogical approaches for teaching critical thinking in computer science, with a focus on multidisciplinary perspectives.

AB  - Attitudes towards science and scientific perspectives in the future depend on early childhood science experiences. Preservice teachers who are provided with the opportunity to develop positive attitudes and self-efficacy towards science teaching before they enter professional life are more likely to help preschoolers develop positive attitudes towards science in their professional life. The aim of this 12-week study was, therefore, to determine the effect of a shadow play workshop on early childhood preservice teachers' self-efficacy beliefs and attitudes towards science teaching and to investigate their workshop experiences and application processes. This study employed an explanatory sequential mixed methods design. The sample consisted of 24 first-year early childhood preservice teachers. Quantitative data were collected using the Early Childhood Teachers' Attitudes Toward Science Teaching (TSAS) and the Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument (STEBI) and were analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test and the dependent sample t-test. Qualitative data were collected through focus group interviews and observations and were analyzed using content analysis. Results showed that shadow play had a positive effect on participants' self-efficacy beliefs and attitudes towards science teaching, indicating that shadow play is an interesting, fun, and effective material that can be used in early childhood science education to turn abstract concepts into concrete forms. Results were discussed with reference to literature, and recommendations were made for future studies.

AB  - Integrated STEAM instruction continues to be a major focus of K-12 education. In effort to better understand STEAM education, we reviewed existing frameworks for implementing integrated STEAM in classrooms. We found that existing frameworks largely focused on the lens of the teacher, thus leaving the student perspective of STEAM learning experiences out of conversations centered on both research and practice. The purpose of this theoretical paper is to center STEAM education on students' rights, obligations, and duties within integrated STEAM instruction as a way to refine understanding of students' positions in STEAM learning experiences. We use theoretical considerations and evidence to explore new ways for transdisciplinary STEAM to be conceptualized from a student perspective. We conclude with considerations and implications for future STEAM education research.

AB  - Sustainability transitions need professionals with specific skills and attitudes that students often do not develop in their regular chemistry education. To foster sustainability change-maker competencies, we suggest augmenting higher education curricula, e.g., chemical degree programs, with transdisciplinary challenge-based learning combined with design thinking. The Da Vinci Project at Utrecht University (UU) in The Netherlands explores this approach, aiming to cultivate the undergraduates' sustainability change-maker competencies. After five years of experience, we reflected on the students' learning outcomes in this UU honors program. We conclude that transdisciplinary challenge-based education combined with design thinking provides unique opportunities for students to develop valuable skills and attitudes for navigating sustainability transitions, including the transition toward sustainable chemistry. These involve collaboration, communication, creative thinking, integrative problem-solving, stakeholder engagement, openness, empathy, the ability to deal with uncertainty and complexity, self-awareness, critical reflection, courage, and perseverance.

AB  - Interdisciplinarity is becoming increasingly important in education. With the rapidly evolving job market, an interdisciplinary education can prepare students for the flexibility and broad knowledge base required to adapt. At the University of Pisa, we recognized the value of an interdisciplinary educational environment during our participation in the European project EINFOSE, where we harmonized the entry requirements for master programs in Information Science. Prior to this project, we had been building study programs in Digital Humanities and Data Science, whose intersection organically nurtured a diverse learning space. Through this lens, we will reflect on the obstacles constituted by disciplinary barriers and stress the importance of a flexible and open 'ecosystem' for education. These conclusions will be supported by data analysis on the careers of our students over the last eight years.

AB  - Purpose: The current article on social studies in primary and secondary education in Norway covers a range of relevant topics which starts with a brief context of Norwegian society, history and social studies framework. Main topics are the new (2020) curriculum, textbooks analyses, social studies teacher competence and practices followed by research in social studies. Findings: The original data on teacher practice reveal that teachers talking while using textbooks is (still) a dominant form of practice in Norway, but there is a great variety of practices both in and out of school (excursions). The textbooks still aim at being 'neutral' and less critical. A new national curriculum from November 2019 emphasises interdisciplinarity subjects, and have less goals than the previous 2006, but is still very specific and rather top down. Some research is presented, the field is under researched, and an outlook is discussed.

AB  - While the great scientists of the past recognized a need for a multidisciplinary approach, today's schools often treat math and science as subjects separate from the rest. This not only creates a disinterest among students, but also a potential learning gap once students reach college and then graduate into the workforce. "Cases on Research-Based Teaching Methods in Science Education" addresses the problems currently facing science education in the USA and the UK, and suggests a new hands-on approach to learning. This book is an essential reference source for policymakers, academicians, researchers, educators, curricula developers, and teachers as they strive to improve education at the elementary, secondary, and collegiate levels. Following a foreword, preface, and acknowledgment, this book contains the following sections and chapters: Section 1: Curricula Changes: (1) Making Sense of Science: A Review in Scottish Further Education (Nancy El-Farargy); (2) Developing Scientific Literacy: Introducing Primary-Aged Children to Atomic-Molecular Theory (Jennifer Donovan and Carole Haeusler); (3) Implementing the Understanding by Design Framework in Higher Education (Judy Alhamisi, Blanche Jackson Glimps, and Chukwunyere E. Okezie); (4) Martial Arts and Physics: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Increase Student Engagement and Interest in the Sciences (Eugenie de Silva); and (5) The Inclusion of Multidisciplinary Research in Science Teaching: A Novel Teaching Method (Eugene de Silva, Eugenie de Silva, Jeffrey Horner, and Pamela Knox. Section 2: Content Presentation: (6) Developing a Research-Informed Teaching Module for Learning about Electrical Circuits at Lower Secondary School Level: Supporting Personal Learning about Science and the Nature of Science (Keith S Taber, Kenneth Ruthven, Neil Mercer, Fran Riga, Riikka Hofmann, and Stefanie Luthman); and (7) Presenting Physics Content and Fostering Creativity in Physics among Less-Academically Inclined Students through a Simple Design-Based Toy Project (Nazir Amir and R. Subramaniam). Section 3: Research: (8) Using Multidisciplinary Research Experiences to Enhance STEM Learning through Undergraduate, Team-Based, Summer Research Projects for At-Risk Students (Jennifer Yantz, Brittany D. Smith; Ginger Holmes Rowell, Thomas Cheatham, Donald Nelson, D. Christopher Stephens, and Elaine Bouldin Tenpenny); (9) Collaborative Teams as a Means of Constructing Knowledge in the Life Sciences: Theory and Practice (Grant E. Gardner and Kristi L.

AB  - Interdisciplinary learning experiences (i.e., experiences which illuminate learning of, and connections among, multiple disciplines) are essential to building a more robust understanding of the interconnections of multiple systems. Having an interdisciplinary understanding positively influences the ability of learners to contribute to solving wicked problems (e.g., soil degradation, climate change), most of which fall within the realm of agriculture, food, and natural resources (AFNR). Therefore, within AFNR Education, preparing learners via interdisciplinary experiences could empower the next generation of problem solvers. The Curriculum for Agricultural Science Education (CASE) has emerged as a potential method for teaching AFNR and science in an interdisciplinary way. However, research has yet to evaluate the impact of CASE on teachers' intentions to teach science within curricula. In this study, intentions to teach science were compared between CASE-certified and non-CASE-certified educators via a national survey of 212 randomly sampled teachers, 81 of whom were CASE-certified. Within four of the eight courses evaluated, CASE-certified teachers intended to teach more science than non-CASE-certified teachers, while non-CASE-certified teachers intended to teach more science in the remaining four courses. The findings suggest opportunities to enhance the interdisciplinary structure of CASE curriculum and/or explore alternative models for facilitating interdisciplinary learning within AFNR Education.

AB  - This follow-up study presents a design-based research (DBR) setting implemented over a three-year project called 'eKidZ - Teach Your Parents Well' which uses research-based learning and follows the four phases of DBR. In an iterative cycle, 20 teenagers aged 14-16 took on the role of researchers and investigated intergenerational learning and the multiplier effects of students participating in the Climate Change Education project 'k.i.d.Z.21 - Competent into the Future' on their parents, using the complete research process. Simultaneously, scientists implemented and tested the DBR setting to validate student research findings and to evaluate the quality of the educational setting. In this fully integrated DBR, using multiple methods (quantitative and qualitative), educational and scientific perspectives are brought together to evaluate students' findings and draw conclusions regarding their learning effects. These research results demonstrate that not only did students generate valid and reliable research, but - when changing perspectives - teenagers also contribute to the discussion about closing the gaps in science education and practice. By examining young people's research on Climate Change Education and recognising their contribution in scientific discourse, this paper offers a host of new insights. Highlights: Teenagers take on the role of researchers and perform reliable and valid research results on intergenerational learning and multiplier effects in Climate Change Education, by completing all phases of research-based learning. Design-based research is an effective method to combine science and education and thus delivering novel insights into science education and practice. High-quality Climate Change Education fosters constructive cooperation among all participants with inter - and intragenerational learning and multiplier effects. Constructivism, transdisciplinarity and research-based learning form the basis for effective design-based research and Climate Change Education.

AB  - In the last decades, agroecological and permacultural initiatives and organizations have grown. These initiatives attend to notions of food sovereignty and alternative models of agricultural production. The confluence of different actors and social initiatives through which experiences and knowledge of cultivating food are shared, and new ones are created, reveals a high educational potential. In light of impending global catastrophes such as climate change and pressing inequalities, new alternatives and diverse forms of sociability are necessary to open up possible futures for life on a damaged planet. Freirean approaches to science education must align with transdisciplinary social and political movements, and generate reflective practices and methods. This article addresses the case of an art and permaculture cooperative (APC) to analyze how communities work together to disrupt and dismantle inequities in science and education and make a more livable world. We offer a critical and contra-hegemonic pedagogical perspective on science education, one that forges new epistemic territories grounded in cooperation, art, permaculture, relationship, and diverse ecologies. The APC is the only one of its kind in Argentina. It has carried out its socio-ecological activities and interventions in ways that respect the characteristics of the natural ecosystem, agriculture and permaculture. We use narratives and case study methods to reveal how people's subjective narratives give meaning to their experiences and learnings. The APC as a learning context has the potential to transform reality, promoting the development and strengthening of popular science education for liberation, one that honors diverse ecologies, and meaningfully addresses new socio-environmental challenges and concerns.

AB  - This paper draws attention to basic philosophical perspectives which are of theoretical and methodological interest for science education, general education and curriculum research. It focuses on potential contributions philosophy class can offer if philosophy education opens up for science and for a collaboration of teachers in the context of post-compulsory education. A central educational goal is to connect basic philosophical skills with any curricular intellectual practice. This implies the possibility of crossing disciplinary boundaries. Hence, the present paper questions the disciplinary rigidity of education and aims at bridging the artificial gap between teaching philosophy and teaching science in order to enrich the individual school subjects involved. Towards this end, this article sketches out a conceptual framework for the issue of interdisciplinarity with regard to philosophy and science in upper secondary school. This framework takes into account aspects of the nature of science (NOS), history and philosophy of science (HPS) and the critical thinking approach which have significant implications for teaching. It aims to facilitate a basic understanding of the significant positive impact philosophy could have on improving scientific literacy as well as decision-making in general. I set forth methods of cross-curricular teaching which can promote innovation in education as interdisciplinarity already does in research since there is growing appreciation of collaboration and partnership between philosophy and science.

AB  - As the interconnectedness of the world grows, the need to prepare college students capable of addressing complexity likewise grows. In this context, the University of Dayton has developed and tested a transdisciplinary model for education. This model links multiple classes from different disciplines via a common theme and within a common space. It also employs an educational model premised on the following trajectory: disciplinary content development / transdisciplinary observation (empathy); transdisciplinary disruption leading to "A-Ha" observations which transform the disciplinary directions; and lastly transdisciplinary informed design and research. Central to this model is a 3,500 square foot common space used only by the classes participating in the experience. In this space classes share their reflections and content with other classes via both personal linkages and analog communications. The other classes respond to these from their disciplinary and personal perspectives. Thirteen classes, fourteen faculty, and over three-hundred students participated in a themed experience centered on the addiction crisis in Dayton, Ohio. Participants included faculty in applied creativity, engineering, health and sport science, education, theater, and religious studies. Also serving as co-teacher were community stakeholders. Assessment of the experience revealed variable student takeaways. Most prominent among these was student recognition that the experience had expanded their perspectives of the other disciplines. Most suggested that it had improved their ability to collaborate in a transdisciplinary environment and that it had significantly impacted their career aspirations. Fewer acknowledged the experience had improved their ability to create.

AB  - To assist preservice elementary teachers in attaining scientific competence, knowledge, and understanding of interdisciplinary concepts, a teacher education model--the combined individual microteaching, modeled teaching, and inquiry-based team-teaching (CIMIT) model--was established, and its effectiveness was evaluated. A quasiexperimental design was adopted, and 57 preservice elementary teachers from 2 classes of a science education preparatory course were included in the analysis (30 in the experimental group and 27 in the control group). The 18-week course comprised 36 h of classes. Before and after the course, all participants completed pretests and posttests, respectively, that measured basic scientific competency and subject matter knowledge. Quantitative and qualitative data were also collected and analyzed. The instruction of the CIMIT group comprised 3 stages: individual microteaching, modeled demonstration inquiry--based teaching by an expert teacher, and inquiry-based team teaching. For the control group, the inquiry-based team-teaching stage was omitted. The results validated the effectiveness of the CIMIT model. First, the experimental group exhibited a significantly greater improvement in scientific competency and knowledge than did the control group. Second, after training, the experimental group's knowledge of interdisciplinary concepts increased for all seven interdisciplinary concepts.

AB  - The ability to analyse aspects of visual culture--works of art, maps or plans, graphs, tables and X-rays--quickly and efficiently is critical in decision-making in a broad range of disciplines. Eye tracking is a technology that can record how long someone dwells on a particular detail in an image, where the eye moves from one part of the image to the other, and the sequence the viewer uses to interpret visual information. These MP4 recordings can be played back and graphically enhanced with coloured dots and lines to point out this natural and fluent eye behaviour to learners. These recordings can form effective pedagogical tools for learning how to look at images through the eyes of experts by mimicking the patterns and rhythms of expert eye behaviour. This paper provides a meta-analysis of studies of this kind and also provides the results of a cross-disciplinary project which involved five different subject areas. The consensus arising from our meta-analysis reveals an emerging field with broad concerns in need of more integrated research. None of the studies cited in this article are interdisciplinary across the sciences and arts and, while some of them address higher education in medicine and computing, there are no interdisciplinary studies of how eye tracking is important for teaching in arts and science subjects at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. In addition, none of the studies address how learning practitioners find these eye recordings useful for their own understanding of learning processes. This establishes the unique contribution of this project.

AB  - This paper introduces hands-on curricular modules integrated with research in atmospheric ice nucleation, which is an important phenomenon potentially influencing global climate change. The primary goal of this work is to promote meaningful laboratory exercises to enhance the competence of students in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) by applying an appropriate methodology to laboratory ice nucleation measurements. To achieve this goal, three laboratory modules were developed with 18 STEM interns and tested by 28 students in a classroom setting. Students were trained to experimentally simulate atmospheric ice nucleation and cloud droplet freezing. For practical training, this work utilized a simple freezing assay device called the West Texas Cryogenic Refrigerator Applied to Freezing Test (WT-CRAFT) system. More specifically, students were provided with hands-on lessons to calibrate WT-CRAFT with deionized water and apply analytical techniques to understand the physicochemical properties of bulk water and droplet freezing. All procedures to implement the developed modules were typewritten during this process, and shareable read-ahead exploration materials were developed and compiled as a curricular product. Additionally, students conducted complementary analyses to identify possible catalysts of heterogeneous freezing in the water. The water analyses included: pH, conductivity, surface tension, and electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. During the data and image analysis process, students learned how to analyze droplet freezing spectra as a function of temperature, screen and interpret the data, perform uncertainty analyses, and estimate ice nucleation efficiency using computer programs. Based on the formal program assessment of learning outcomes and direct (yet deidentified) student feedback, we broadly achieved our goals to (1) improve their problem-solving skills by combining multidisciplinary science and math skills and (2) disseminate data and results with variability and uncertainty. The developed modules can be applied at any institute to advance undergraduate and graduate curricula in environmental science.

AB  - Peer observation of teaching has been adopted as a method to improve the quality of teaching. It involves observers providing descriptive feedback to their peers on learning and teaching practices. However, although extensively described in the literature in the education field, its use as a tool for development beyond teaching skills has not been explored deeply, nor the best practices described. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare quantitative with qualitative peer observation, as well as to investigate the role of interdisciplinarity in the observation process. The present study results from experimental observation work carried out by four professors of higher education. Veterinary science, social work, pharmaceutical sciences, and education, the disciplinary areas of origin of the teachers, were the ecosystems in which the initial observation techniques were explored and applied, and the intention was to share good practices and pedagogical improvements through peer support. This study reports the experience of building an observation grid and its application, as well as the lessons learned during the observation experience. The aim was to evaluate whether the constructive criticism was focused on the pedagogical practices rather than on the content, which can be useful in understanding if the learning objectives are being attained, from the teacher's point of view. As such, we employed and assessed peer observation as a constructive, developmental process for higher education teachers from different fields of knowledge. The study concludes that feedback by peers is essential for the development of professional practice in higher education teaching, with the experience of qualitative observation being a fundamental path for teacher self-reflection in the search for their own authenticity. It further supports the notion that interdisciplinary differences, methodologies, styles, contexts, and practices can be used in a constructive way to improve course content and delivery, and, ultimately, to reinforce good teaching.

AB  - This article critically examines three assumptions underlying recent efforts to advance interdisciplinary research-defined in this article as communication and collaboration between researchers across academic disciplines (e.g. Sociology, Psychology, Biology)--and examines these assumptions' implications for health professions education research (HPER). These assumptions are: (1) disciplines are silos that inhibit the free flowing of knowledge across fields and stifle innovative thinking; (2) interdisciplinary research generates a better understanding of the world as it brings together researchers from various fields of expertise capable of tackling complex problems; and (3) interdisciplinary research reduces fragmentation across groups of researchers by eliminating boundaries. These assumptions are among the new beliefs shaping the contemporary academic arena; they orient academics' and university administrators' decisions toward expanding interdisciplinary research and training, but without solid empirical evidence. This article argues that the field of HPER has largely adopted the premises of interdisciplinary research but has not yet debated the potential effects of organizing around these premises. The authors hope to inspire members of the HPER community to critically examine the ubiquitous discourse promoting interdisciplinarity, and engage in reflection about the future of the field informed by evidence rather than by unsubstantiated assumptions. For example: Should research centres and graduate programs in HPER encourage the development of interdisciplinary or disciplinary-trained researchers? Should training predominantly focus on methods and methodologies or draw more on disciplinary-based knowledge? What is the best route toward increasing the field's profile within academia and attracting the best students and researchers to engage in HPER? These are questions that merit attention at the current juncture as the future of the HPER field relies on decisions made in the present time.

AB  - The much-needed interest in promoting a healthy lifestyle among school-age students has found a context for development: school gardens. There are numerous studies where using gardens as a teaching-learning context also improves students' performance in the experimental sciences. In this study, we proposed another interest that sets it apart and adds motivation: combining curricular mathematics with experimental science content in this context. The search for possible studies in the scientific literature has gave rise to the review presented herein. From this review, we obtained 21 studies, from which we extracted a series of categories: whether research was undertaken and with which tools; which curricular contents were covered and the impact produced; the ages of the participants and duration of the project; and, finally, whether the garden was cultivated. The main conclusion of this search was the lack of a clear line of research linking school gardens, the experimental sciences, and mathematics, in addition to the scant presence of studies framed in this context. For that reason, we send a call to action to the scientific community encouraging the interdisciplinarity of the two aforementioned subjects within the context of school gardens.

AB  - The interdisciplinary nature of food makes it an effective teaching vehicle in many fields. This article shows specifically how flavor and food fermentation, two topics not usually featured in the undergraduate STEM curriculum, can inspire a powerful interdisciplinary learning experience. Importantly, because of their accessible nature and relatively unexplored status in current research, these two topics are also uniquely attractive as authentic research experiences for students from diverse backgrounds. Focusing on these topics, the author designed and executed a student-centered science course. The course is unusual from other Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) in being highly inquiry-driven and discovery-based, with students independently defining their research topics. By emphasizing curiosity, creativity, and practicing how to generate "good" research questions, the course fills a gap in the traditional undergraduate research experience and curriculum. The findings of the article are based on hundreds of enrolled students from five course offerings. It shows that the course promotes student engagement and curiosity, as well as gains in conceptual learning and in self-reported learning of concepts and science skills. Further, students report valuing the hands-on and inquiry-based format for improving their learning, engagement, and sense of curiosity about the material.

AB  - Transdisciplinary learning environments have potential to bring together the arts, sciences, and computing within schools. We investigate the student and teacher enactment of sensemaking practices that break down disciplinary silos. We describe a pedagogical approach, Luminous Science, where students make dynamic, computationally-rich artistic representations of data from a classroom garden. Then we present an analysis of students' sensemaking practices used during the transdisciplinary unit in three cases of art, science and computing classrooms. Qualitative analysis of a student group and teachers' curricular materials in each of these classrooms elucidates how teachers' enactment choices, organization, and facilitation of the unit we co-designed with them facilitated opportunities for students' transdisciplinary thinking and learning. We show that when teachers' enactments supported increased computational complexity and ties between artifact and phenomenon, then students participated in deeper transdisciplinary sensemaking. We discuss the implications for the design of curricular materials and professional development to support effective organization and discourse practices by teachers in orchestrating transdisciplinary sensemaking.

AB  - The world is facing severe global challenges such as climate change, food security, rising migration, social justice, or the current corona crisis. In these times, citizenship education seems more important than ever. How can this citizenship education relate to mathematics and science learning? The research project MaSDiV (Supporting mathematics and science teachers in addressing diversity and promoting fundamental values) connected mathematics and science with citizenship education by modeling real-life problems relevant to society. In this paper, we present the foundational design features of the PD course as well the results from the accompanying evaluation of this PD course, which was implemented by partners in six countries to support teachers in connecting mathematics and science education with citizenship education. More specifically, we investigate how participating teachers experienced the PD program; how their self-efficacy beliefs, learning-related beliefs, as well as teaching practices change; and which factors contributed to that change. In order to investigate the outcome of the PD program, we surveyed N = 311 mathematics and science teachers' pre- and post-participation of the PD in six different European countries. Among others, our results show that in general, most participating teachers reported a high overall satisfaction with the course across all six participating countries. They also indicate that teachers' self-efficacy beliefs about using relevant contexts, their learning-related beliefs about the benefits of using contexts, as well as their own teaching practice changed significantly after participating in the MaSDiV PD course.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to contribute to the exploration of inter-disciplinary approaches in higher education for sustainability. It is a reflection on a case study linking students in the arts and sustainability science, through which the inter-disciplinary and problem-solving processes for solving a concrete sustainability challenge were explored. Design/methodology/approach: The case study featured a workshop with students from two educational programmes at Aalborg University, namely, Art and Technology and Environmental Management and Sustainability Science, the latter being an engineering programme and the former part of the humanities. Experience evaluation was based on participant observation, written feedback and the workshop facilitators' post-event reflections. Data analysis was based on multi-grounded theory, dialectically combining empirical data (through open coding) with relevant emergence theories. Notions of emergence were chosen because the supposed benefit of inter-disciplinarity is the emergence of novel solutions to complex problems. The study investigates the concrete conditions of emergence in educational inter-disciplinary settings. Findings: The workshop led to a successful experience, bringing an art-based approach together with sustainability science for arriving at solutions that neither of the two would have arrived at separately. Based on participant experiences and realisations, five "emergence concepts" are suggested as supportive learning criteria and conditions, namely, "knowledge expansion", "complementarity", "disciplinary self-reflection", "change of practice" and "play". Originality/value: The findings and emergence concepts can be an inspiration for creating an effective learning environment supporting the emergence of different forms of knowledge and solution concepts for solving sustainability challenges.

AB  - In this theoretical essay, we find inspiration in Lotman's semiotics, in Morìn's sociology of education, the studies of cultural psychology and psychoanalysis of Valsiner and De Luca Picione, and other cultural stimuli coming from the didactics of mathematics. The notion of boundary and liminality was developed and discussed to grasp a relationship between some psychological processes and some transformative aspects of educational processes. Our idea is that an interdisciplinarity education could help orient disciplinary resources towards common educational goals and acquire the skills necessary for each student to be a citizen of the glocal community.

AB  - The knowledge of historically marginalized learners, including racially and linguistically minoritized learners, tends to be obscured in institutionalized learning contexts and by the dominant discourse of "learning loss," which was reinforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on critical ethnography and the methodology of shared walks, this article highlights intergenerational ways of knowing embodied and emplaced in the context of traditional farming sustained and mobilized by a Syrian refugee family. We illustrate what children were indeed learning in the land of refuge during the pandemic, with their family, beyond narrowly defined in-school learning. We conceptualize the recentering of intergenerational ways of knowing, often overlooked in colonial institutionalized learning spaces, as "transdisciplinary" acts for disrupting the hegemonic disciplinary formation of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

AB  - Science history shows us that interdisciplinarity is a spontaneous process that is intrinsic to, and engendered by, research activity. It is an activity that is done rather than an object to be designed and constructed. We examine three vignettes from the history of science that display the interdisciplinary process at work and consider the implications for education. We consider recent examples of interdisciplinary science education, including where interdisciplinarity involves students in authentic scientific research. We conclude that the reconciliation of research and education is a meaningful role for interdisciplinary practice in science education. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - This study explored the views of 63 Taiwanese pre-service teachers who had participated in a workshop about the value of integrating drama-based approaches in their practical science learning. It was primarily designed to investigate the pedagogical approach of Heathcote and other founders of process drama. In addition, it examined specific claims that it immerses learners in an enjoyable and social learning environment (Poston-Anderson, 2008; Lin, 2017) and that learners can practice core scientific skills such as making predictions, observing, and then validating their predictions (Weisberg et al., 2016). Following the workshop, participants completed an anonymized online questionnaire. Descriptive data analysis indicated that most participants (75%) strongly agreed that integrating drama-based approaches into practical science teaching was satisfying. Of the remainder, 20.7% agreed, 2.1% neither agreed nor disagreed, 2.2% disagreed, and none strongly disagreed with this statement. Moreover, 34.9% of the participants lacked opportunities to experience improvisation and integration of drama-based teaching in practical science. The study indicated that a drama-based approach can be a highly effective strategy for enhancing practical science teaching among pre-service teachers. Furthermore, the findings provide valuable insights into the factors influencing drama-based teaching in practical science. They suggest it could be an excellent strategy to stimulate learners' interest in science and interdisciplinary science-related subjects and improve their science skills. Teachers could thus provide young children with similar drama-based teaching in practical science activities to promote their learning of science. Finally, the study offers a set of important recommendations for future pedagogical policymaking and further research by drama-based practitioners.

AB  - Novel biomaterial development is a rapidly growing field that is crucial because biomaterial fouling, due to rapid and irreversible protein adsorption, leads to cellular responses and potentially detrimental consequences such as surface thrombosis, biofilm formation, or inflammation. Therefore, biomaterial technology's fundamentals, like material biocompatibility, are critical in undergraduate education. Exposing undergraduate students to biomaterials and biomedical engineering through interdisciplinary experiments allows them to integrate knowledge from different fields to analyze multidisciplinary results. In this practical laboratory experiment, undergraduate students will characterize surface properties (contact and sliding angle measurements) for the antifouling polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer using a goniometer and a smartphone, as well as quantify protein adsorption on antifouling surfaces via a colorimetric assay kit to develop their understanding of antifouling surface characteristics, UV-vis spectroscopy, and colorimetric assays. The antifouling PDMS polymer is prepared by silicone oil infusion and compared to untreated control PDMS. The polymer hydrophobicity was demonstrated by static water contact angles of ~99° and 102° for control and antifouling PDMS surfaces, respectively. The control PDMS sliding angle (>90°) was significantly reduced to 9° after antifouling preparation. After 24 h incubation of polymer samples in a 200 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution, the surface adsorbed BSA was quantified using a colorimetric assay. The adsorbed protein on the fouling PDMS controls (29.1 ± 7.0 [microgram]/cm[superscript 2]) was reduced by ~79% on the antifouling PDMS surface (6.2 ± 0.9 [microgram]/cm[superscript 2]). Students will gain experience in materials science, biomedical engineering, chemistry, and biology concepts and better understand the influence of material properties on biological responses for biomaterial interfaces.

AB  - The most challenging global problems of our age involve coupled human--environmental systems within the Food-Energy-Water Nexus. The undergraduate students currently in our classrooms will be tomorrow's global citizens, each of whom must be prepared to understand and reason about these challenges and ultimately make decisions about them in a variety of contexts. Postsecondary institutions, then, must afford students multidisciplinary, STEM-based experiences that help them develop this knowledge and skillset. In light of this need, we developed and taught an introductory undergraduate course--Water in Society--grounded in contemporary, real-world, "socio-hydrological" issues. The course, designed to serve the needs of both STEM majors and nonmajors, was designed and offered by an interdisciplinary team of hydrology, economics, and science education faculty. Key course themes include engagement with authentic data, scientific models and modeling, multimodal forms of scientific communication, and research-based best practices for effective STEM instruction. Here, we describe the first iteration of the course, including elements of the class that exemplify these primary course themes and pedagogical reflection on instructional experiences and student feedback.

AB  - What are the current challenges and opportunities for bringing actor-network theory (ANT) into issues-based science education? This article discusses experiences gained from introducing an educational version of ANT deploying digital technology into an upper secondary school science class. This teaching innovation, called "controversy mapping", has been pioneered in different contexts of higher education before being adapted to school education. Experimenting with controversy mapping in a Swedish science class raised both conceptual and practical issues. These centre on: (1) how ANT-inspired controversy mapping redesigns the citizenship training enacted by institutionalized approaches to issues-based education as socioscientific issues (SSI); (2) how controversy mapping reconfigures the interdisciplinarity of issues-based science education; and (3) how controversy mapping displaces scientific literacy and knowledge of the nature of science as guiding concerns for teaching in favour of new preoccupations with digital literacy and digital tools and methods as contemporary infrastructures of free and open inquiry.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to develops an interdisciplinary business and computer science pedagogy for teaching and learning computer programming in business schools at higher education institutions and explores its associated benefits, challenges and improvement. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a body of theories, an interdisciplinary pedagogy is developed and tested for programming education in a business context. Meanwhile, based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, the authors used observation study and thematic analysis to explore opportunities, challenges and future improvements associated with this interdisciplinary pedagogy. Findings: The developed pedagogy includes integrating humanism and construction theory, problem-based learning, cognitive development, active instructional strategies, synergy of individual and group programming tasks and creating an encouraging and inclusive learning environment. This study shows that business students perceive this novel pedagogy as highly valuable because it enhances their logical thinking and problem-solving abilities while giving them a sense of accomplishment. Although students face challenges in data preprocessing, error handling and translating theoretical knowledge, they find it useful to review teaching materials, seek peer support and learn independently through online resources. Further improvements in pedagogy include incorporating collaborative code reviews, using shared documents for troubleshooting and grouping students based on their prior programming experience. Practical implications: This interdisciplinary pedagogy can guide business schools to improve the quality of programming-related modules, enhance students' performance and prepare them for future careers. Originality/value: This is the first interdisciplinary study investigating teaching programming in a business context.

AB  - In this paper, we propose novel transdisciplinary STEAM practices to enable students and teachers to model architecture using technology. Architectural modelling can foster students' mathematical knowledge and computational thinking while connecting them to other disciplines such as culture and history. Our study focuses on enabling architectural, cultural, and historical diversity in educational practices. Moreover, the study tries to foster participants' modelling skills and innovative technology use as augmented reality and 3D printing. Thus, this paper will describe three case studies from Austria, Libya, and Indonesia and how these STEAM practices were used in different ways to allow participants to express their diversities through modelling diverse architectural constructions cross-culturally. We followed a qualitative data analysis approach for the participants' interviews, questionnaires and artefacts including architectural modelling, disciplines connections and lesson plans. The data analysis resulted in emerging themes emphasizing STEAM practices' possibilities to connect architecture to culture and history and highlighting the participants' cultural diversities in each of the three case studies.

AB  - This study investigated sixth-grade students' development of multidisciplinary models involving the integration of mathematics, science, and statistics, together with shared STEM practices. Mathematics and science featured a reciprocal relationship within the real-world context of tsunami inundation. Experimenting with water tubs comprising "landmasses" and "shore slopes" of varying angles, students explored how varying the slope of the shoreline affects the inundation distance. Given that organising and structuring data are essential to the creation of models as systems of representation, students' modelling revealed a basic understanding of key statistical concepts and processes, including variation and covariation, and an ability to identify trends both within and across data sets. Students were able to apply their learning in recommending ways of minimising the impact of a real-world tsunami, demonstrating how such an investigation can facilitate understanding of natural phenomena. The overall findings indicate how elementary-grade students can successfully engage in independent multidisciplinary modelling within integrated STEM investigations and develop important conceptual understandings in the process.

AB  - Transdisciplinary approaches increasingly are needed to address complex environmental problems. Students can benefit from research and learning opportunities in which they investigate issues, integrate knowledge across disciplines, engage with stakeholders, collaborate with others, and devise solutions. This paper presents information on a 1-week intensive transdisciplinary course focused on climate, water, and agriculture for undergraduate and graduate students. The course, which was held at The Ohio State University's Stone Laboratory on Lake Erie, was offered over 3 years and utilized the local and regional context for investigation and inquiry. Presentations, discussions, experiential and field activities, and guest presentations were used as a way to promote student learning. Students felt positive about their participation and rated the transdisciplinary aspects of the course highly. Ideas from this course can be used to develop similar courses and learning experiences in other settings and on other environmental topics. Instructors are encouraged to utilize campus and local resources, recruit students from a diversity of disciplines, and align content and activities to build transdisciplinary skills.

AB  - Computer science education (CSEd) is a growing interdisciplinary area that continues to gain momentum from students, researchers, and educators. Yet, there are few formal programs or degree options for students interested in pursuing graduate work in CSEd. This article explores the existing state of CSEd in the United States (U.S.) through semi-structured interviews with (n = 15) faculty engaged in CSEd research. Thematic coding of the transcripts revealed the complexities involved in the development of formal programs, the distinct considerations for faculty, and the value of having strong ties to both computer science and education. The themes described positive aspects of support and cohesion within the larger community and opportunities to expand knowledge across fields. Applying Cornell and Parker's principles of interdisciplinary science to the field of CSEd, we provide recommendations for ways forward and discuss the potential impact on institutional structures, research capacity, individual and group identities, and teaching and learning. The findings from this investigation not only inform on the present state of CSEd in the U.S., but also offer guidance for CSEd-focused graduate programs.

AB  - Interdisciplinary science teaching is an issue in various countries. One example in Europe is Germany, especially regarding comprehensive schools. At the same time, German teacher education is primarily subject-specific. An examination of data on self-efficacy beliefs is helpful for understanding the qualifications of teachers for interdisciplinary science. Previous measurement instruments for teaching biology, chemistry, physics, and science lack a literature-based, theory-based, or curricular-valid measurement or a systematic obstacle to overcome. Thus, to meet these requirements, this research developed a draft for a new instrument to measure self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching (SElf-ST). As the theoretical base, the instrument operationalizes a model of pedagogical content knowledge for teaching science and adapts it to self-efficacy beliefs. In a cross-sectional study (N = 114 pre-service and trainee teachers), a ten-factor-solution for self-efficacy beliefs resulted from an exploratory factor analysis (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin-criterion = 0.858, [alpha] = 0.70-0.86). Nine factors are linked to the theoretical model. An additional tenth factor emerged: Teaching Ethically Relevant Issues. Nine factors show low and medium correlations with teaching experience. Eight factors show at least low correlations with self-rated content knowledge in no less than one of the three subjects. In general, science-specific factors show rather low or medium correlations, and generic factors (e.g., Applying Media, and Applying Methods of Evaluation) show low or no correlations. This result is in accordance with the context specificity of self-efficacy beliefs. These results meet most of the research expectations and provide initial indications of the concurrent, curricular, and divergent validity of the SElf-ST instrument. The paper argues for the development of a new, theory-based instrument to measure self-efficacy beliefs of interdisciplinary science teaching.

AB  - Science and art are intrinsically linked. Science requires curiosity, along with skills in observation, problem-solving, and critical thinking. Art is no different; however, the two disciplines are typically presented as opposites to children at a young age and the emphasis on differences lead to a false dichotomy of career paths and even self-identification. Recent research has shown that integrating artistic disciplines such as creative writing into traditional STEM fields aids both majors and non-majors in establishing interdisciplinary connections between required education courses and courses in their field of interest, resulting in increased student learning and understanding. This study incorporated creative writing into a college-level entomology course through writing prompts where students observed magnified images of arthropods and other objects and described them using creative language. The students were also encouraged to engage with the course material through personal experiences and reflections. We discovered that this creative writing assignment helped students gain confidence in their writing abilities, foster new connections through critical thinking, and develop a deeper appreciation for entomology. In addition, this exercise helps instructors identify student's misconceptions, establish baseline class knowledge, and connect facets of multiple disciplines to meet learning objectives.

AB  - The majority of this essay describes the content, pedagogy, and assessments associated with an undergraduate, interdisciplinary honors seminar on science and religion. The seminar is structured around five major themes: (a) philosophy of science, religion, and their interactions, (b) historical and contemporary case studies, (c) the controversy over biological evolution in the United States as a necessary case study, (d) comparative religion and science, and (e) contemporary issues at the intersection of science and religion. I also describe the consistency between the seminar and the mission of the honors college at my institution. Given the prominence of both science and religion in contemporary culture, I assert that such a course is engaging for students and faculty alike and provides opportunities for multidisciplinary involvement.

AB  - A key desired learning outcome of higher education is that students understand the complexities and contexts of, as well as the multiple disciplinary perspectives on, the subjects they are studying. Geography higher education has been particularly adept at meeting this objective. Geographers have played key roles in the development of interdisciplinary areas of studies such as environmental studies, cultural studies, food studies, and science and technology studies, which have increased interest in thematic learning and awareness of the myriad disciplinary perspectives on a particular topic. These efforts, however, have failed to achieve the broader dissolution of siloed disciplinary thinking in classrooms and across the university, leading to proposals for new transdisciplinary frameworks, such as "convergence science." In this paper, we argue that geography, due to its long-standing role as a synthesis discipline, ought to be at the forefront of bringing this new wave of convergence research into education and training programs. We provide an example of a convergence-based and co-instructed course series for graduate students called the Biosocial Studio, led by a geographer in collaboration with bioscientists. We identify two key pedagogical tools that facilitated the learning process -- studio-based teaching and cross-epistemological convergence -- and discuss the internal and infrastructural challenges to their implementation.

AB  - Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) are a promising integrated educational tool for customizing formal education using intelligent instruction or feedback. In recent decades, ITSs have transformed teaching and learning and associated research. This study examined the evolution and future trends of ITS research with scientometric methods. First, a dataset comprising 1173 relevant publications was compiled from the Web of Science Core Collection databases (including the Science Citation Index Expanded and the Social Science Citation Index). Then, the publication distributions by time, author, institution, country/region, and knowledge sources were analyzed to reveal the multidisciplinary integration paths. Dataset co-occurrence and co-citation analyses were conducted to identify the most popular research issues, the research chronology, and the emerging trends. It was found that: (1) ITS research has been growing in recent years. According to the Price literature exponential growth curve, this field is still in its initial stage while has high potential; (2) computer science, education, psychology, and engineering were the main ITS research knowledge sources, with ITS social science publications since 2007 being higher than ITS natural sciences publications; (3) interactive learning environments, student modeling, teaching/learning strategies, and machine learning have been the most popular research foci; and (4) the Coh-Metrix, problem-centered instruction, and STEM are the current research trends.

AB  - Science educators have highlighted the need to develop students to integrate knowledge across science disciplines to address real-world issues. However, there has been little research about the development of interdisciplinary assessment instruments. In this research, the instrument that measures the level of upper-secondary school students' interdisciplinary understanding of environmental issues was developed and validated based upon Wilson's Construct Modeling framework. After a pilot testing, the revised assessment instrument of interdisciplinary understanding covering five typical environmental problems comprised 14 multiple-choice questions and four constructed-response questions. Five hundred twenty-three eleventh graders, including 279 boys and 244 girls from mainland China, made up the research sample. The partial credit Rasch analysis has verified the reliability and validity of the interdisciplinary understanding instrument. In addition, the results of cluster analysis revealed that over half of the students could use some partially accurate scientific concepts and principles from two or more disciplinary perspectives to deal with a specific environmental issue. The validated instrument can provide insights for assessing and developing upper-secondary school students' interdisciplinary understanding in science education.

AB  - This article takes up the argument from an earlier article and seeks to detail the importance and role of the history and philosophy of science (HPS), conceived as a unitary interdisciplinary field, in science education. However, on this count, it not only seeks to ground the salience for science education at the school level but also its role in higher education. While elaborating upon its importance in school education, it charts out additional areas where the HPS could enrich the already existing objectives envisaged. Furthermore, the article highlights the importance of HPS both at the level of the pedagogy of undergraduate education as well as research mentorship at the graduate level. While, for analytic purposes, these two spheres are addressed separately, the article argues for the need to forge linkages between them.

AB  - This meta-analysis evaluated how well learners' conceptual understanding, environmental attitudes, and pro-environmental behavior were improved by the Socio-Scientific Issues (SSI)-based approach based on the literature (2017-2021). The research analyzed various studies on the efficacy of SSI-based techniques, such as argumentation, case-oriented approaches, and problem-based learning. The findings showed a strong positive influence on learners' understanding of intricate environmental concerns and their propensity for sustainable conduct. While the study found that the SSI-based approach fosters critical thinking and involvement in several noteworthy ways, it also uncovered potential publication biases in certain aspects. Furthermore, the research stressed the necessity of context-specific strategies and interdisciplinary collaboration to improve the robustness and application of SSI-based interventions in climate change education. The results highlight how the SSI-based approach can cultivate proactive, environmentally conscientious, knowledgeable citizens ready to address urgent global concerns.

AB  - Despite growing calls to develop data science students' ethical awareness and expand human-centered approaches to data science education, introductory courses in the field remain largely technical. A new interdisciplinary data science program aims to merge STEM and humanities perspectives starting at the very beginning of the data science curriculum. Existing literature suggests that humanities integration can make STEM courses more appealing to a wider range of students, including women and students of color, and enhance student learning of essential concepts and foundational reasoning skills, such as those collectively known as data acumen. Cultivating students' data acumen requires a more inclusive vision of how the knowledge and insights generated through computational methods and statistical analysis relates to other ways of knowing.

AB  - Technological progress, globalization and demographic changes have brought about transformations that have increased economic and social inequalities. A structural transformation in education could support economic growth and sustainability and could also be associated with common actions in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, together with social sciences, to mitigate the impact of these megatrends on inequalities. This research explores the effects of a technologically conceptualized transdisciplinary educational approach. A sample of 242 lower secondary school students was selected and a pre- and post-test research design was used to ascertain whether a two-level transdisciplinary educational approach used by technology teachers affected the development of students' technological literacy (TL). The task design included several real-life technological contexts and concepts wherein knowledge of other disciplines was needed to solve problems, create new knowledge and acquire higher-order skills while developing positive attitudes towards sustainable technology. A two-way analysis of variance indicated several significant effects of transdisciplinary education on the development of students' TL. These findings provide valuable insights into the nature of TL acquisition as a basis for curriculum design and the implementation of transdisciplinary technology education in the lower secondary school.

AB  - This study addressed the intractable issue of ensuring that all students, including those who are linguistically and culturally diverse, have access to high quality science education. We explored the efforts of two organizations in the United States (one that supports science teachers and one that focuses on language development) to design resources that can inform science instruction for multilingual learners. We used Bronstein's (2003) framework for interdisciplinary collaboration to shed light on the institutional, program, and interpersonal factors that defined and helped sustain the collaboration between the two organizations. The findings showcase what it takes to integrate equity, science, and language development considerations in resources designed to inform content-area instruction for multilingual learners. The paper adds to the nascent literature on the role of interdisciplinary collaboration in supporting the science education of multilingual students and is unique in its exploration of both the process and the product of this collaboration.

AB  - European advocates of Liberal Arts and Sciences education often claim that this educational model is highly effective at teaching students a range of generic, transferable, or 21st-century skills, which are thought to be vital for success in the labour market of the future. However, there is little empirical research into whether and how these programs do so. This paper examines how European Liberal Arts and Sciences students experience how their programs teach them generic skills. It is based on a significant number of interviews with students from a range of programs across Europe. It concludes that a multidisciplinary curriculum with significant freedom of choice, active student-centred pedagogy with open assessment, and an emphasis on academic community are experienced as key features that foster the development of generic skills. This finding both confirms and expands the current theoretical understanding of generic skills acquisition, as well as yielding several suggestions for how other programs might teach these skills better.

AB  - Argumentation is widely recognised as a core practice of science, but the relation between argumentation in the teaching of science in contrast to the teaching of other school subjects has not been sufficiently addressed. In this study, we investigate science and religious education (RE) teachers' instructional practices related to argumentation in lower secondary lessons in England. Through qualitative analysis of a pair of science and RE teachers' instructional practices, we characterise how the teachers participating in a professional development project understand and teach argumentation. Data sources included questionnaires, lesson materials, classroom video recordings, and written teacher reflections. Findings suggest that both teachers recognised the value of argumentation in their subject, but some variations existed in the nuances of their views and particularly how different instructional strategies were utilised to achieve the lesson goals related to argumentation. The study highlights the teachers' different understandings and enactments of argumentation as a disciplinary practice and an instructional objective in science and RE lessons. We call for further consideration of argumentation in different school subjects and how argumentation can enrich science teaching in interdisciplinary contexts.

AB  - Biomedical science students need to learn to code. Graduates face a future where they will be better prepared for research higher degrees and the workforce if they can code. Embedding coding in a biomedical curriculum comes with challenges. First, biomedical science students often experience anxiety learning quantitative and computational thinking skills and second biomedical faculty often lack expertise required to teach coding. In this study, we describe a creative coding approach to building coding skills in students using the packages of Processing and Arduino. Biomedical science students were taught by an interdisciplinary faculty team from Medicine and Health, Science and Architecture, Design and Planning. We describe quantitative and qualitative responses of students to this approach. Cluster analysis revealed a diversity of student responses, with a large majority of students who supported creative coding in the curriculum, a smaller but vocal cluster, who did not support creative coding because either the exercises were not sufficiently challenging or were too challenging and believed coding should not be in a Biomedical Science curriculum. We describe how two creative coding platforms, Processing and Arduino, embedded and used to visualize human physiological data, and provide responses to students, including those minority of students, who are opposed to coding in the curriculum This study found a variety of students responses in a final year capstone course of an undergraduate Biomedical Science degree where future pathways for students are either in research higher degrees or to the workforce with a future which will be increasingly data driven.

AB  - Liberal arts programs encompass a range of academic disciplines, and their effectiveness relies not only on what these disciplines are, but also on how they are integrated. The natural sciences are one important component of liberal arts programs that may be difficult to assimilate with the rest of the curriculum. In this paper, the topic of neglected tropical diseases is provided to illustrate an innovative approach to bridging transdisciplinary connections across and through disparate academic disciplines. This approach is supported by evidence from prior studies demonstrating the effectiveness of transdisciplinary teaching at promoting creativity, knowledge retention, and student motivation.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is the unification of philosophy, cognitive science, mathematics, neurophysiology, psychology, computer science, information theory, cybernetics, and uncertainty theory. Therefore, it is feasible and necessary to utilize STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Liberal Arts, and Mathematics) education to learn artificial intelligence courses. Computational thinking skills are of vital importance to high school students. This paper integrates artificial intelligence education with STEAM model with the aim of enhancing students' computational thinking skills. First, we investigate the feasibility of this model and set teaching objectives about artificial intelligence curricula. Second, artificial intelligence curricula with STEAM model is proposed to carry out interdisciplinary artificial intelligence knowledge acquisition. Finally, the effects of this model on students' computational thinking skills, learning motivation, and self-efficacy are evaluated. One hundred thirty-six participants are recruited from a high school in Beijing. The results reveal that the integration of artificial intelligence education with STEAM is able to promote computational thinking skills, learning motivation, and self-efficacy of the students in the experimental group. The main implication of this study is that artificial intelligence education in light of STEAM model can be used as a teaching guide for the combination of artificial intelligence curricula with multi-disciplinary knowledge at the primary and secondary levels.

AB  - As the value of multi-disciplinary working in the business and research worlds is becoming more recognised, the number of inter-disciplinary postgraduate environmental and health sciences courses is also increasing. Equally, the popularity of problem-based learning (PBL) is expected to grow and influence instructional approaches in many disciplines. However, very limited research has been conducted to explore the perception of students of PBL in inter- or multi-disciplinary environments; particularly wide-ranging multi-disciplinary courses which cross the natural-social science barrier. The findings from this case study evidence the difficulties and benefits students derive from group PBL, many of which stem from working in multi-disciplinary and multi-skilled groups on a part-time basis. Acknowledging, accepting and overcoming conflicts based upon prior experience that influences epistemological and ontological beliefs may be key to the development of effective PBL in inter-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary programmes. Recommendations for good pedagogic practice to maximise learning in postgraduate environmental and science education are made.

AB  - Entrenched compartmentalisation of subjects in secondary school means that students lack opportunities for learning how disciplines relate to each other and how knowledge can be applied in real-world contexts. This article examines what it means to 'think like a scientist in a multidisciplinary arena' and why this is (and should be) an integral part of secondary school science education. To this end, the article outlines a workshop, 'Renoir's painting', for key stages 3 and 4 (ages 11-16), which aims to develop students' understanding of the power and limitations of science and how science relates to other disciplines.

AB  - Numerous national initiatives call for interdisciplinary mathematics and science education, but few empirical studies have examined practical considerations for integrated instruction in high school settings. The purpose of this qualitative study was twofold. First, the study sought to describe how and to what extent teachers integrate mathematics and science curricula in their classrooms after having participated in an intervention to promote and support mathematics and science integration. Second, the study was intended to expand our understanding of the barriers to and factors that enable integrated approaches in high school classrooms. The theoretical component of this study builds on and adapts previous models of science and mathematics integration to introduce the Intradisciplinary, Cross-disciplinary, Multidisciplinary, Interdisciplinary (ICMI) framework for identifying and defining classroom integration strategies. Findings include a description of several distinct practices high school teachers related to integrated instruction as well as the trade-offs teachers considered when making decisions related to integrated curricula. The implications of the findings for researchers and practitioners are discussed. Finally, we propose the conceptualization of "interdisciplinary pedagogical content knowledge" in mathematics and science as an area of focus that will enable teachers to successfully move toward interdisciplinary instruction.

AB  - The Environmental Studies curricular area, taught at primary school level in Portugal, is a challenging context for curricular interdisciplinarity and the achievement of small-scale research and creative and innovative experiences, inside and outside the classroom. From that assumption, we present, under the master course of primary teacher training, a pedagogical intervention developed with a class of 1st and 3rd year primary school children. Our research focus was to understand to what extent the realization of experimental activities, in a class with children of different school levels, promotes the learning of science and affects other school skills. In this sense, we built and validated teaching resources whose goal is to promote science learning in the classroom, complementing this formal space with another educational context, a laboratory in a higher education institution in the same city. This study has shown that these teaching resources have provided the capacity to building interdisciplinary skills. Considering the attitudes and the affective component, it seems that this was a significant time in the children's personal and social education process, combined with active learning and socializing. We support the idea that science education in the early years of schooling is promoter of scientific literacy.

AB  - Global carbon cycling describes the movement of carbon through atmosphere, biosphere, geosphere, and hydrosphere; it lies at the heart of climate change and sustainability. To understand the global carbon cycle, students will require "interdisciplinary knowledge." While standards documents in science education have long promoted interdisciplinary understanding, our current science education system is still oriented toward single-discipline-based learning. Furthermore, there is limited work on interdisciplinary assessment. This article presents the validated Interdisciplinary Science Assessment of Carbon Cycling (ISACC), and reports empirical results of a study of high school and undergraduate students, including an analysis of the relationship between interdisciplinary items and disciplinary items. Many-faceted Rasch analysis produced detailed information about the relative difficulty of items and estimates of ability levels of students. One-way ANCOVA was used to analyze differences among three grade levels: high school, college Freshman-Sophomore, college Junior-Senior, with number of science courses as a covariate. Findings indicated significantly higher levels of interdisciplinary understanding among the Freshman-Sophomore group compared to high school students. There was no statistically significant difference between Freshman-Sophomore group and Junior-Senior group. Items assessing interdisciplinary understanding were more difficult than items assessing disciplinary understanding of global carbon cycling; however, interdisciplinary and disciplinary understanding were strongly correlated. This study highlights the importance of interdisciplinary understanding in learning carbon cycling and discusses its potential impacts on science curriculum and teaching practices.

AB  - Teachers, pre-service teachers and teacher educators in Australia are predominately European Australian with a small minority of First Nations people. Those with limited first-hand understanding of First Nations ways of knowing can find it difficult to embed these knowledges across learning areas. This is particularly complex for pre-service teachers. We argue that all teacher educators have a responsibility to engage First Nations ways of knowing across learning areas as an ethical and professional commitment to preparing pre-service teachers for negotiating the complexities of Australian histories and living cultures. This paper reports on interventions implemented with final year primary/middle pre-service teachers with an expertise in science and mathematics. Firstly, we discuss pre-service teachers' confidence (self) ratings in integrating their understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures across the curriculum. Secondly, we present an in-depth exploration of two pre-service teachers' transdisciplinary units of work which embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledges and practices. This study challenges all science and mathematics teacher educators to consider ways a transdisciplinary, culturally responsive approach prepares students to transition into confident and competent early career teachers.

AB  - Transdisciplinary research (TR) is a growing field in a myriad of subject domains ranging from sustainability to education. The idea is to solve complex problems through the collaborative participation of academic actors, community stakeholders, governments, and other leaders to jointly define the problem and find solutions. To accomplish such complex projects, one of the main tools is an efficient technology platform. The need for an efficient technology platform, in turn, leads to a need for an evaluation tool to determine which is the most suitable for a given transdisciplinary research situation, however, a literature review confirms that research on such evaluation tools is scarce. The goal of this paper is to improve the evaluation of technology platforms for individual TR projects, based on the characteristics of that specific TR. The research question is "Can TR characteristics be used to construct an evaluation tool for technology platforms?" The specific aims used to answer the question were: the following: (1) to define the characteristics (core activities and skills) of TR and (2) to construct a tool for evaluating technology platforms for use in TR. Methodology: For the first specific aim, a literature meta-analysis was used; the second specific aim was addressed following a newly developed methodology, including elements of the technology acceptance model and elements of a standard technology evaluation process. Results: A chart for defining the core activities and skills in TR was developed, and a tool was constructed for evaluating technology platforms that could be used in TR.

AB  - In 2009, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) called for more interdisciplinary and community-engaged approaches to teaching and learning in the agricultural and life sciences to better respond to the food system challenges of the 21st century. As a result, institutions from across the nation have responded with a number of experiential learning and service-learning frameworks and practices aimed to enhance the academic experience for both student and community stakeholders. Sustainable agriculture education, with its explicit focus on experiential learning, interdisciplinarity, and values-based programming, has emerged as a promising approach to strengthen the fabric of agriculture and life sciences education. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the complex role of service learning as a central approach to undergraduate teaching and learning where interdisciplinary teaching, experiential learning, and community engagement are core goals. Specifically, we conducted a single embedded case study of a sustainable agriculture education program at a land grant university to explore how this triad was organized and possible service learning outcomes. Our case study was informed by semi-structured interviews of faculty and community partner stakeholders, participant observations of faculty and students, and secondary data analysis of course syllabi and other programmatic artifacts. Despite different understandings and practices of service learning by faculty within this, we found a common core of best practices. We conclude with criteria and best practices to guide teaching and learning from this triad perspective.

Whereas some conceptions of equity focus on ensuring all students have access to the knowledge, practices, and language normatively valued in K-12 schools ("equity as access"), increasingly prominent conceptions focus on transforming those knowledge, practices, and language in ways that center minoritized students and their communities ("equity as transformation"). In this article, we argue that conceptions of equity provide a useful lens for understanding emerging research in science education with MLs and for charting a research agenda. We begin by tracing how conceptions of equity have evolved in parallel across STEM and multilingual education. Then, we provide an overview of recent developments from demographic, theoretical, and policy perspectives. In the context of these developments, we provide a conceptual synthesis of emerging research by our team of early-career scholars in three areas: (a) learning, (b) assessment, and (c) teacher education. Within each area, we unpack the research efforts in terms of how they attend to equity as access while pushing toward equity as transformation. Finally, we propose a research agenda for science education with MLs that builds on and extends these efforts. We close by offering recommendations for making this research agenda coherent and impactful: (a) being explicit about our conceptions of equity, (b) paying attention to the interplay of structure and agency, and (c) promoting interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - Teachers' understanding and teaching of argumentation is gaining more attention in science education research. However, little is known about how science teachers engage in argumentation with teachers of different subject taking an interdisciplinary perspective that may inspire new pedagogical ideas or strategies. In particular, the positioning of argumentation at the juncture of science and religion is rare. This paper reports an empirical study involving science and religious education (RE) teachers who collaborated on teaching argumentation in three secondary schools in England. Their interdisciplinary collaboration was sustained by a series of professional development sessions over 18 months. Analysis of the interview data unfolds how the teachers' collaboration impacted their understanding of argumentation and views of teaching their subject. Through working relationally in exploring and teaching argumentation, the science teachers reflected more notable changes than their RE counterparts. Science teachers came to appreciate student voice in the learning process and the role of argumentation in fostering students' scientific reasoning. The paper is a salient step to researching argumentation in a cross-curricular terrain, particularly in relation to RE. It also sheds light on how collaborating with teachers of another subject bolstered science teachers' professional development and broke subject barriers.

AB  - Teaching undergraduate science courses through the lens of local community issues has the potential to help students connect more strongly to the sciences and to the communities near the university. In considering the construction of such courses, it is clear that even community issues that have strong science cores--water quality, viral and bacterial disease vectors--are inherently multidisciplinary, with scientific and technological considerations in balance with the economic and social factors that inform public policy. The fundamental challenge is, then, to develop ways to teach complex and multidisciplinary community issues within the context of science courses. Here, we report on a pilot study of a course structure designed to address this challenge. Cohorts of students from different disciplines were paired, and a strategy was developed that required the students to work together to teach one another about a community issue from their discipline's perspective. This model was applied to cohorts of chemistry and interior architecture students studying local brownfield redevelopment efforts.

AB  - Some crises, such as those brought on or exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, are wicked problems--large, complex problems with no immediate answer. As such, they make rich centerpieces for learning with respect to public deliberation and issue-based dialogue. This essay reflects on an experimental, transdisciplinary health and science communication course entitled Comprehending COVID-19." The course represents a collaborative effort among 14 faculty representing 10 different academic departments to create a resource for teaching students how to deliberate the pandemic, despite its attending, oversaturated, fake-news-infused, infodemic. We offer transdisciplinary deliberation as a pedagogical framework to expand communication repertoires in ways useful for sifting through the messiness of an infodemic while also developing key deliberation skills for productively engaging participatory decision-making with concern to wicked problems.

AB  - In classrooms worldwide, the use of English to teach science subjects is becoming increasingly common. There is an increasing number of English-as-a-second/foreign-language learners studying science in English. This review examines 66 empirical studies on this topic published from 2000 to 2021. We critically review and synthesise evidence of the language challenges faced by teachers and students in secondary and tertiary English medium instruction (EMI) science courses, as well as proposed coping strategies. By adopting a multidisciplinary approach, we examine our findings from three fields of research: science education, language policy and applied linguistics. Our study extends EMI research by combining language learning and canonical content learning. Our synthesis of previous findings enhances understanding of content teaching in a second/foreign language in language immersion classrooms (e.g. content and language integrated learning, content-based instruction) and provides evidence-based pedagogical suggestions for enhancing EMI science teachers' instructional practices worldwide.

AB  - This research presents results for the design and creation of supporting teaching materials using additive manufacturing. The materials are inspired by selected artwork of four animal species, which belong to a collection from the museum of the University of Antioquia. The topic selected was fauna in Colombia, and the animals in question were chosen based on important roles they have in areas like health, the environment, and food. These animals will complement science education given to several age groups visiting the museum. In addition to the 3D-manufactured objects, a study was conducted using several age groups that are very relevant to the museum: children, teenagers, and first year undergraduate students. A video showing technical information cards about the manufacturing process was also developed. This project was multidisciplinary, involving collaboration between the engineering school, the museum, and a local high school. The results showed that young visitors want complete information on the animals and to have interaction with the animal models, which is not always possible. This project serves as a local strategy not only for taking arts and knowledge out of the museum but also for planning first year courses in the university and thus reducing problems like school dropout, low motivation, and poor performance in national exams.

AB  - Since the 1960s, many scholars have questioned the relationship between library science and information science. This paper investigates LIS doctoral dissertations in terms of their topics and interdisciplinarity in the period 1960-2013. Results show that LIS is an interdisciplinary field in which library science and information science are intimately related. The study shows that Information Science has surpassed Library Science to become the dominant research topic in LIS. It also shows that the academic background of doctoral advisors affects the interdisciplinarity of their student's doctoral dissertations.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratory research was not possible in different educational programs at Delft University of Technology and Erasmus University Medical Center due to the taken measures. Therefore, a team of faculty from both institutions developed an alternative transdisciplinary research group project that was fully performed online. The overall project was named the Corona Research Super Project. This project provided an opportunity for students to fulfil the requirements for their degree while complying with the guidelines of the University, Medical Center, and government. It also gave them an opportunity to participate in something that felt meaningful during a stressful time since all sub-projects contributed to developing knowledge on the current COVID-19 pandemic. This article describes the process of setting up this educational project, the resources provided to the students, and the format of transdisciplinary work. Furthermore, it also provides a theoretical view on how to think about research projects when you cannot be side by side in a laboratory and how to make this into meaningful research education. By sharing our experience of setting up this program in unprecedented times and providing a format, we hope that other universities will use this approach to develop comparable transdisciplinary educational programs. We believe that these sorts of programs are essential for in depth transdisciplinary training of scientists of the future

AB  - A primary aim of science education is to teach students how to interpret and engage with scientific information. To do so effectively requires an adequate understanding of the nature of science (NOS)--in other words, what science is and how it works. There is a long history of evidence to suggest that many undergraduate students struggle to properly understand NOS. While the specific factors contributing to misinformed views on NOS may be difficult to tease apart, the way in which students learn about science at the undergraduate level is a significant contributor. We implemented a reflection activity in a unique first-year program at a large Canadian university in order to promote student learning of NOS. Through the students' reflections, we identified how certain pedagogical approaches, many of which deviate from traditional teaching methods used throughout undergraduate science education, can positively impact student comprehension of NOS. Our experiences support the use of reflective practices in promoting critical thinking and the development of more nuanced student views of NOS.

AB  - This book starts with the premise that beauty can be an engine of transformation and authentic engagement in an increasingly complex world. It presents an organized picture of highlights from the 13th European Science Education Research Association Conference, ESERA 2019, held in Bologna, Italy. The collection includes contributions that discuss contemporary issues such as climate change, multiculturalism, and the flourishing of new interdisciplinary areas of investigation, including the application of cognitive neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and digital humanities to science education research. It also highlights learners' difficulties engaging with socio-scientific issues in a digital and post-truth era. The volume demonstrates that deepening our understanding is the preferred way to address these challenges and that science education has a key role to play in this effort. In particular, the book advances the argument that the deep and novel character of these challenges requires a collective search for new narratives and languages, an expanding knowledge base and new theoretical perspectives and methods of research. The book provides a contemporary picture of science education research and looks to the theoretical and practical societal challenges of the future.

AB  - This book provides a fascinating insight into the on-going process of self-reflection in the Science|Environment|Health (S|E|H) community. The basic vision of a new S|E|H pedagogy is to establish a transdisciplinary dialogue between the three educational fields of science education, environmental education, and health education. This approach finds growing interest among science educators. Since 2014, the ESERA special interest group S|E|H has united both experienced and junior researchers all over Europe in a burgeoning research community. This book presents a selection of results of these vibrant activities. Systems theory has turned out to be a stimulating theoretical framework for S|E|H. The limits of predictability in complex living systems result in structural uncertainty for decision-making, and they ask for emphasising and rethinking the role of pedagogical concepts like informed citizenship and scientific literacy. They challenge crude scientific determinism in environmental and health education, which all too often ends up with students' eco- and health depression. Instead, S|E|H conceives coping with uncertainty in terms of an interplay between cognitive and affective factors. The horizon of the future remains always open. Hope must never die in a new S|E|H pedagogy.

AB  - Over the past decade, integrated STEM education research has emerged as an international concern, creating around it an imperative for technological and disciplinary innovation and a global resurgence of interest in teaching and learning to code at the K-16 levels. At the same time, issues of democratization, equity, power and access, including recent decolonizing efforts in public education, are also beginning to be acknowledged as legitimate issues in STEM education. Taking a reflexive approach to the intersection of these concerns, this book presents a collection of papers making new theoretical advances addressing two broad themes: Transdisciplinary Approaches in STEM Education and Bodies, Hegemony and Decolonization in STEM Education. Within each theme, praxis is of central concern including analyses of teaching and learning that re-imagines disciplinary boundaries and domains, the relationship between Art and STEM, and the design of learning technologies, spaces and environments. In addition to graduate research seminars at the Masters and PhD levels in Learning Sciences, Science Education, Educational Technology and STEM education, this book could also serve as a textbook for graduate and pre-service teacher education courses.

AB  - An interdisciplinary approach to science education through history of art is proposed. The approach is innovative, as the artworks complement the history, philosophy and sociology of science contents to increase students' interest and motivation. The approach integrates humanities and science education through history of art, which requests interdisciplinary cooperation of the teachers of the school subjects involved with historical curriculum contents. The approach is elaborated through the case of Galileo's telescope, which provides specific features on the relationships between science and technology (scientific instrumentation applied to generate knowledge), nature of science, and science-technology-society relationships, where history and art meet each other. Further, history of art contributes some contemporary artworks on Galileo case that highlight all those relationships. The explicitness, perception, beauty and accessibility of the paintings may also be a key element to develop teachers' and students' interest and motivation in teaching and learning science through its integration with history of art. Finally, the interdisciplinary educational approach develops a teaching-learning sequence on the basis of Galileo's telescope to guide teaching the issue in science education through history of art. This didactic exemplification elaborates some aims, contents, resources and activities throughout the human, social, philosophical, artistic, scientific and historical aspects involved in the case of Galileo that teachers must adapt to specific subjects, degree and students.

AB  - Within the context of higher education, the disciplines of science and filmmaking appear disparate, but the importance of storytelling as an integral part of science and research deserves closer examination. Humans have always used stories to share information and convey complex ideas. To those outside science, science communications can be laden with difficult terms and feel exclusive and unrelatable. There has been a recent call to develop science storytelling skills to improve accessibility of science for a general audience. With the rise of video content on social media platforms, short-format videos can reach an untapped audience for science. This case study looks at a unique interdisciplinary course, Science Docs, that encourages students from all areas of study to form a Community of Practice (CoP) that bridges the gap between scientist, storyteller, and science communication evaluator.

AB  - Big Brother, newspeak, doublethink, vapourised people and thought police became worldwide famous expressions. 1984 novel portrays a nightmare society controlled by information manipulation and by suppression of both history and science. This study aimed to investigate the impact of using the 1984 dystopian novel associated with socio-scientific issues (SSI) in the development of moral values and reasoning skills of high school students. An interdisciplinary didactic program encompassing the Arts, Philosophy and Biology subjects was elaborated to stimulate discussion and debates around SSIs. The didactic intervention was evaluated through a questionnaire and the 1984 film debate. The students were able to explore scientific concepts to discuss social issues and correlated the allegory of the cave topic with alienation and the 1984 novel. The students also recognised that the approached issues are related not only to their life in society but to existential human conditions. We claim that dystopian texts allied to SSI debates can function as creativity triggers to stimulate students developing the inquiry skills and dispositions needed to express themselves, challenging fake news and uncovering new possibilities to apprehend the truth.

AB  - Health-related career goals are popular among high school science students, yet few understand the application of chemistry and biology research to the field of medicine and its impact on society. In this five-day multidisciplinary summer camp, high school students learn about the real-world relevance of medicinal chemistry research and its application to human health through a series of hands-on synthesis, isolation, and biological testing experiments. Our approach makes use of natural product related bioactive molecules, namely aspirin, oil of wintergreen, and eugenol, to highlight the connection between biology and chemistry in the field of medicinal chemistry. The subsequent analysis of these pharmaceutical agents via a variety of antibacterial testing, cell viability, and toxicity assays helps students understand the drug discovery process. In addition to laboratory experiments, students learn about various health professions through visits to Lawrence Technological University nursing and physician assistant program suites and a meeting with an experienced pre-health professions advisor. Through this unique ensemble of experiences, high school students gain valuable insights into the nature and impact of scientific research on the field of medicine and learn about a variety of health-related occupations. Participant survey responses indicate that students enjoyed learning about chemistry- and biology-related concepts and techniques related to the drug discovery process. Furthermore, this week-long summer camp met or exceeded all participants' expectations, with many students expressing enhanced confidence in their scientific abilities.

AB  - Hydraulic fracturing ('fracking'), like other complex social and environmental issues, is a controversy about science which raises educational questions about how best to prepare young people to understand, respond to and, where necessary, act (or not) in response. It raises political questions. We present a state-of-the-art review of research literature on fracking and education using systematic strategies, with a view to finding out how it is framed in educational situations and how politics enters the science classroom. This serves as an illustrative case of how contested scientific and technological interventions with implications for the environment and society are treated in school science. The review is supplemented by interviews with 10 teachers of science and engineering working in schools or colleges near sites of operational exploratory fracking. We find that the research literature on teaching hydraulic fracturing is sparse, with only 25 studies relating to teaching and learning about fracking. Few studies (n = 7) relate to high school education. Where it features in science education, fracking is used as a context for interdisciplinarity and critical thinking, and lends itself to approaches using discussion, dialogue and modelling. Outcomes from fracking education range include knowledge gains and critical thinking. Teachers interviewed tended not to see a place for fracking in the curriculum or in the classroom and were averse to including politics in upper high school science education. Our analysis suggests depoliticization through absence of this specific complex environmental issue from the public (education) sphere, reinforced by the desire for 'balance' in high school science education and instrumental approaches to science education which prioritize assessed learning outcomes. Dealing with complex social and environmental issues such as hydraulic fracturing in the years of compulsory science schooling is necessary because scientific knowledge is necessary but not sufficient to prepare young people for the critical scientific literacy required to meet sustainable development goals. There is a need to assess and respond to the educational needs of local communities affected by industrial interventions such as fracking. These findings are likely to be relatable to other issues where there are local and global consequences of action or inaction and where the environment and health are pitted against economic and energy demands.

AB  - Background: Knowledge of quantum computing is arguably inaccessible to many, with knowledge of the complex mathematics involving a particular barrier to entry, creating difficulty in terms of teaching and inclusive learning for those without a high level of mathematics. Meanwhile, it is increasingly important that the knowledge of quantum technologies is accessible to those who work with real-world applications and is taught to the younger generation. Purpose: Resulting from collaborative dialogue between physicists, computer scientists, educationalists, and industrial end users, we propose the concept of quantum literacy as one means of addressing the need for transdisciplinary research in response to the complex problems that we see at the heart of issues around global sustainability. In this way, quantum literacy can contribute to UN Sustainable Development Goal 4, Quality Education. Methods: We introduce a specific puzzle visualization learning tool through which to achieve the pedagogic ends we set out with respect to quantum literacy. Visualization through puzzles can enable non-specialists to develop an intuitive, but still rigorous, understanding of universal quantum computation and provide a facility for non-specialists to discover increasingly complex and new quantum algorithms. Using the Hong-Ou-Mandel optical effect from quantum mechanics, we demonstrate how visual methods such as those made possible through the puzzle visualization tool can be very useful for understanding underlying complex processes in quantum physics and beyond and therefore support the aims of quantum literacy. Conclusion: We argue that quantum literacy, as defined here, addresses the challenges of learning within a highly bounded discipline and of access to the kind of powerful knowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners. We therefore argue for the importance of addressing pedagogic issues when powerful knowledge consists of dense concepts, as well as complex and hierarchical relations between concepts, in addition to presenting a strong barrier to entry in the form of mathematics.

AB  - The European Commission policy approach of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) is gaining momentum in European research planning and development as a strategy to align scientific and technological progress with socially desirable and acceptable ends. One of the RRI agendas is science education, aiming to foster future generations' acquisition of skills and values needed to engage in society responsibly. To this end, it is argued that RRI-based science education can benefit from more interdisciplinary methods such as those based on arts and digital technologies. However, the evidence existing on the impact of science education activities using digital media and arts-based methods on RRI values remains underexplored. This article comparatively reviews previous evidence on the evaluation of these activities, from primary to higher education, to examine whether and how RRI-related learning outcomes are evaluated and how these activities impact on students' learning. Forty academic publications were selected and its content analysed according to five RRI values: creative and critical thinking, engagement, inclusiveness, gender equality and integration of ethical issues. When evaluating the impact of digital and arts-based methods in science education activities, creative and critical thinking, engagement and partly inclusiveness are the RRI values mainly addressed. In contrast, gender equality and ethics integration are neglected. Digital-based methods seem to be more focused on students' questioning and inquiry skills, whereas those using arts often examine imagination, curiosity and autonomy. Differences in the evaluation focus between studies on digital media and those on arts partly explain differences in their impact on RRI values, but also result in non-documented outcomes and undermine their potential. Further developments in interdisciplinary approaches to science education following the RRI policy agenda should reinforce the design of the activities as well as procedural aspects of the evaluation research.

AB  - In these Anthropocene times humans are vulnerable through the effects of socio-ecological crises and are responsible for attending to past, present and future socio-ecological injustices and challenges. The purpose of this article is to challenge discursive structures that infuence knowledge acquisition "about/of" the world through binary logics, acknowledging that we are never apart from the world we are seeking to understand, but that we are entangled through a mutual (re)confguring "with" the world. Through storytelling and entangled poetry from outdoor education and environmental science education contexts, this article explores discursive/material forces (socially meaningful statements/affective intensities) enacted through pedagogies 'attuning-with'. As pedagogies 'attuning-with' take up a relational ontology, in which sense-making is generated from the grounded, lived, embodied and embedded politics of location in relationship with broader ecologies of the world, they illuminate a transdisciplinary environmental education. A transdisciplinary environmental education is important for these Anthropocene times, because it not only promotes a multivocal approach to environmental education, but in acknowledging our inherent and intrinsic responsibility and accountability for the kinds of worlds that we are co-constituting, it provides opportunities to change the story of how we choose to live with/in/for these Anthropocene times.

AB  - According to extensive research, problem-based learning (PBL) in STEM education improves student learning outcomes and supports them in gaining practical skills necessary for upward future careers. Despite current efforts to promote PBL-STEM activities in education, their uptake in life science remains low. Several types of research involving college instructors indicate that instructor guidance of PBL-STEM activities is one of the crucial aspects for its successful usage in educational settings. However, to our knowledge, little research has been undertaken on the effectiveness of participants' PBL-STEM learning in coping with problems and dilemmas encountered during the STEM learning process. This research intends to investigate the efficacy and provide experiential references to demonstrate the existing gaps by a transdisciplinary approach. The effect on participants' professional learning interest, comprehension capacity, problem-solving ability, self-efficacy, and cooperation abilities is related to five dependent variables. Our findings from paired t-test analysis demonstrate that STEM participants had a significant difference before and after experiencing PBL-STEM learning objectives. In the light of a one-way ANOVA, STEM learner participation in this course was more important than gender and age in improving STEM literacy through classroom activities. In line with feedback interviews, students who engaged in experiential learning favored reciprocal advantages and mutual benefits within their groups through teamwork, practical application, and information acquisition. Given that the participants in this study were early adopters of PBL-STEM, any future research should aggressively encourage these students to create and implement solutions in the classroom based on their ideas.

AB  - An interdisciplinary Pop-Up Learning Community (PLC) allowed students from various disciplines with different levels of content knowledge to discuss their perspectives on and beliefs about climate change. The impact of this event on students' climate change beliefs was gauged by a survey from the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. This survey, the Six Americas Super Short Survey, consists of four questions relating to climate change belief. During the event, students participated in various activities, including faculty modeling of discussions about climate change using and highlighting their disciplinary perspectives and analysis skills, communications exercises, interdisciplinary table discussions, and writing in response to a social media message. After the conclusion of the event, students submitted reflections on their experiences at the PLC, which supplemented data collected during the event. Students gained an understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of climate change discussions and applied general education skills and knowledge to spoken and written conversations about climate change.

AB  - This study investigates teachers' perceptions and practices of designing and teaching transdisciplinary STEAM curriculum using online authentic assessment. Aligning the transdisciplinary STEAM curriculum to authentic assessment is a conceptual framework that guided this study to focus on the three learning domains (cognitive, psychomotor, and affective). The participants are middle and high school teachers (n = 37) in a private school in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). An exploratory mixed method was adopted as a research design. The qualitative data (document analysis) was gathered through analyzing STEAM lesson plans. An online questionnaire was used to collect the quantitative data from teachers. The study's results reveal that teachers' perceptions and practices about the design of STEAM curriculum using authentic assessment were positive with regards to the three learning domains (cognitive, psychomotor, and affective). The highest agreement of teachers' responses was found to be in the affective domain.

AB  - While education increasingly relies on social media technologies to provide richer learning experiences, the rigid and course-centric design of curricula still imposes a challenge for students to construct meaningful connections between social media and formal learning. Building on the knowledge graphs' potential to establish semantic links among data entities, this paper investigates to what extent knowledge graph-based tools help students with integrating and accessing transdisciplinary social media content in formal courses, and contribute to constructivism in online learning environments? This study proposes a framework that includes a set of tools built on a novel knowledge graph designed to help educators in exposing detailed coverage of their formal courses through explicit concepts, which can serve as building blocks for students to integrate and access transdisciplinary social media content in formal learning settings. The framework is piloted in a business school where 180 students used these tools in an information systems (IS) course. The preliminary results indicate the majority (around 68%) of materials shared and accessed by students through this framework was connected to other disciplines beyond IS, reflecting the possible creation and exploration of transdisciplinary links between social media content and formal courses. Thirty-three students were interviewed to evaluate their opinion on the tools with respect to social constructivism in online learning environments. The interviews provide initial insights on the tools' potential to promote constructivism by supporting collaborative, learner-centered, high-quality, authentic, facilitated, and interactive learning principles. The study helps students and educators better integrate and access emerging social media content in formal courses.

AB  - Background: Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (NST) have been recognized as an emerging technology of the 21st century. The interdisciplinary nature and remarkable applications of NST have prompted science education researchers to recognize its potential in science teaching. NST have also been acknowledged as a vital field in technology in order to understand the socio-scientific issues of innovations as described by the EU framework of Responsible Research & Innovation (RRI). Purpose: The current paper focuses on the design and implementation of a teaching learning sequence (TLS) for 6th Grade primary students. Our aim is to investigate how primary students approach basic concepts of NST and to what extent they can reflect on RRI issues. Program description: The described TLS is focused on size and scale and on the change of properties at the nanoscale based on hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials, while RRI issues are discussed through newspaper articles and students' interaction with nanoscientists. Sample: 45 6th Grade primary students from Greece took part in the study during the academic school year 2014-15.Design and methods: The teacher who taught the TLS also assisted in creating its design through collaborating with experts from the field of NST, science education and science communication. Data was collected through students' worksheets and interviews with students. For the data analysis, qualitative methods of content analysis were used. Results: The results showed that primary students can successfully understand NST key concepts like 'size and scale' and 'size-dependent properties'. Regarding the dimensions of RRI, NST appear to be a useful context for enhancing students' discussions more about Ethics, Engagement and Science Education and less about issues related to Gender Equality, Open Access and Governance. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that teaching NST is worthwhile even in primary education. Moreover, NST provide an appropriate context for the introduction of RRI in science education.

AB  - Systems thinking, interdisciplinary research projects, and creative problem solving are ways to frame modern chemistry curricula to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, teachers, and citizens to use their skills and education to create a sustainable future. By integrating planetary boundaries, green chemistry, and the UN sustainable development goals, we use a systems thinking approach in undergraduate education and outreach to a range of diverse populations to drive discussion, exploration of scientific principles, and teach students how they can use chemistry to solve the distinctive challenges of the anthropocene. Interdisciplinary research projects employ critical thinking, problem solving, and creativity as part of the scientific method. Translating undergraduate research in nanotechnology, renewable energy, and sustainability into lesson plans and engaging in outreach to diverse populations promotes equity in science education and encourages underrepresented groups to seek careers in a scientific field. Community college students act as role models in outreach as they teach chemistry using a systems thinking approach, connect sustainability to STEM careers that can make a positive impact on local communities, and show underrepresented groups that they are needed in these disciplines. Engaging, interdisciplinary laboratories used in outreach, such as the synthesis of algae biodiesel, making paints from natural resources, sustainable agriculture and engineering, and DNA origami, access all aspects of systems thinking. Using systems thinking as a framework in science education and outreach teaches students the significance and relevance of chemistry while creating a platform for women and underrepresented groups to learn how important their representation is to contribute to a sustainable, equitable future.

AB  - Preparing 21st century learners is the goal of both the "Common Core State Standards" ("CCSS") and the "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS"). These two sets of standards jointly illuminate the need to teach scientific and literacy skills that will more appropriately prepare elementary students to successfully participate in science education. One way to meet this challenge is through interdisciplinary instruction. Interdisciplinary instruction prepares students to meet the "CCSS" and "NGSS" by creating a specific purpose for developing and using literacy skills This column provides ideas and techniques to enhance science teaching. This month's issue shows how teachers can use literature and higher-level thinking questions to enhance science instruction.

AB  - Non-formal learning environments, such as science museums, have a fundamental role in science education and high potentialities as ideal contexts for science teachers' training. These aspects have been analyzed and reported in several recent works mainly focused on students' perception of science and increased engagement towards scientific disciplines. In this work, a project-based learning methodology optimized and experimented in the frame of a pre-service chemistry teachers' course at the University of Pisa (Italy), during the last eight years, involving in total 171 participants, is presented. This educational project has several distinctive features related to the STEAM philosophy, with a high level of multi-disciplinarity and creativity. Most of the laboratories and chemistry-centered activities were conceived, planned and carried out by the future chemistry teachers in non-formal contexts, such as science museums. A case study based on a series of non-formal laboratories designed by a group of students during their training in the academic year 2018-2019 and performed in a science museum is reported and examined in details. In this paper, all steps of the STEAM project-based learning methodology are described underlining the main learning outcomes and cognitive levels involved in each step and the relevant methodologies proposed during the training course and adopted in the project. The effectiveness of this pre-service teachers' training methodology is finally discussed in terms of participants' motivation and interest towards the course's content, students' final judgment of their training experiences and, in particular, of the STEAM project-based learning activities. From the students' feedbacks and final assessment, the role of the non-formal context in teaching and learning chemistry and the efficacy of developing educational activities related to current and real-life chemistry-centered topics emerged as very positive aspects of the proposed approach.

AB  - Archiving is a process of organizing and creating content for sustainable, long-term access. However, the "archivists" actively shape the content in the realm of the performing arts, which often involves adding a new layer of knowledge to the original artform. This article explores the archiving of a ballet repertory course conducted in a higher education institution in Hong Kong during the pandemic, including the archival product and the collaborative process between a multidisciplinary team of people from dance, education, and library science. While teaching repertory online has its challenges, being "online" also offered unique learning experiences. Aiming to illustrate the topics related to hybrid pedagogy and individual creativity in use during the pandemic, the team conducted interviews with some participants for the purpose of creating a series of short educational films. These materials were collected and stored in the institution's digital repository as the first archive for a specific course.

AB  - Providing interdisciplinary learning opportunities in agriculture, food, natural resources (AFNR), and science is critically important. School-based agricultural education offers a valuable platform to connect AFNR and science; however, interdisciplinary teaching requires willing and able teachers. The current study considered the intentions of school-based agriculture teachers to teach science within AFNR curriculum. Using the theory of planned behavior, attitude toward teaching science, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and perceived science knowledge were considered as independent variables to teaching science within AFNR curriculum. The explanatory model was analyzed using structural equation modeling. In total, school-based agriculture teachers intended to teach science in 39.91% of AFNR curriculum. Only perceived science knowledge was a statistically significant, negative predictor of intended science teaching. Findings pinpoint the need for additional research into the unexpected relationship between perceived science knowledge and science teaching intentions. The need and nature of potential explorations, along with specific recommendations for practice, are discussed.

AB  - Due to its constructivist nature, interdisciplinary teaching appears ideal for increasing students' interests in subjects (Brassler, 2020; Kramer & Wegner, 2021). Although many argue in favor of a more comprehensive implementation of interdisciplinary teaching in schools, many practical barriers arise during the realization that need to be resolved following the design-based research approach (DBR) (Kramer & Wegner, 2022b). Especially at the upper secondary school level, implementation seems to be difficult. The question arises of how interdisciplinary instruction can be usefully implemented in the upper grades. As a first potential solution, interdisciplinary project days were developed in the subject combination of biology and physical education and evaluated with the help of an initial study. The prototypes developed increased both students' situational interests and their perceptions of the utility value of the subjects involved (Kramer & Wegner, 2021; 2022a). However, the implementation process could be optimized, as it currently depends on reducing other school subjects. Therefore, following the iterative cycle of DBR, a new prototype was developed involving interdisciplinary units within the regular subject lessons. The second prototype was empirically evaluated with a control-group design. In contrast to the first prototype, only descriptive trends were found, indicating that the interdisciplinary units trigger situational interest and stabilize individual interest. However, this cannot be supported statistically. Due to a high data dropout, the sample size should be increased, and the trends should be further investigated. In terms of practical feasibility, the second prototype has an advantage as it does not require any cancellation of subject lessons. However, implementing a second subject may reduce the time available for subject-specific content.

AB  - This paper, the second in a series of three, explores the representation of Earth System Science (ESS) in the Australian Curriculum (ACARA, 2018a)) through the Cross Curriculum Priority area of Sustainability and the Australian Curriculum: Science (F-12), with a focus on F-10. Part I (in Teaching Science, 68.1) overviewed the current understandings of the Earth System and the relatively recent interdisciplinary field of Earth System Science (ESS). Here, in Part II, an analysis of the Cross Curriculum Priority area of Sustainability and the Australian Curriculum: Science (F-12) revealed that several key ESS understandings and system-thinking skills were present. How the most current ESS understandings and abilities could lead to a far deeper understanding of the Earth System are then considered and those that may need more attention from students and teachers are highlighted. Part III (in a forthcoming issue) outlines several research-informed pedagogies to help learners develop more scientific understandings of the Earth System, and appropriate related abilities. These Earth System goals and pedagogies needed to be considered in the ACARA review of the Australian Curriculum: Science and the Sustainability Cross Curriculum Priority area -- to that end, this paper was submitted to the appropriate committees. We believe the suggested ESS additions and emphases could comprise one pathway toward a more comprehensive and confident Earth System literacy and a stronger engagement in the Earth and other sciences at every school level, and to the curriculum as a whole. Better-informed, sustainability decision-making and actions by students as today's, and tomorrow's, citizens is the hoped-for outcome. [For Part I, see EJ1346071.]

AB  - Today's school students are inheriting complex and harmful global challenges that are potentially irreversible and which they will need to address. The ability to think critically and creatively, to work in interdisciplinary teams and to understand the importance of a healthy planet for all life will be needed for success. Education has a major role in helping humanity achieve this. This article argues that transformations in both curriculum and pedagogy are required. It offers a potential conceptualisation and examples of what learning might look like to achieve these aims, exemplified by school science education as science will need to play a significant role if these global challenges are to be successfully met. This new conceptualisation draws upon Young's (2012, 2013) 'powerful knowledge' and the rather different approach found in Reiss and White's (2013) arguments for an 'aims-based' curriculum to propose curricula and associated pedagogies that can potentially address the global challenges of our times.

AB  - Education in implementation science, which involves the training of health professionals in how to implement evidence-based findings into health practice systematically, has become a highly relevant topic in health sciences education. The present study advances education in implementation science by compiling a competence profile for implementation practice and research and by exploring implementation experts' sources of expertise. The competence profile is theoretically based on educational psychology, which implies the definition of improvable and teachable competences. In an online-survey, an international, multidisciplinary sample of 82 implementation experts named competences that they considered most helpful for conducting implementation practice and implementation research. For these competences, they also indicated whether they had acquired them in their professional education, additional training, or by self-study and on-the-job experience. Data were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach that combined qualitative content analyses with descriptive statistics. The participants deemed collaboration knowledge and skills most helpful for implementation practice. For implementation research, they named research methodology knowledge and skills as the most important ones. The participants had acquired most of the competences that they found helpful for implementation practice in self-study or by on-the-job experience. However, participants had learned most of their competences for implementation research in their professional education. The present results inform education and training activities in implementation science and serve as a starting point for a fluid set of interdisciplinary implementation science competences that will be updated continuously. Implications for curriculum development and the design of educational activities are discussed.

AB  - This paper presents a teaching scenario designed to introduce preschool children to electricity, structured around the 5E instructional model (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate). The study involves 18 children from an urban kindergarten with diverse backgrounds and learning needs. Over four weeks, children engage in interactive activities to understand electrical devices, electric current, static electricity, conductors, insulators, electricity generation, and safety. The curriculum integrates interdisciplinary learning, combining literacy and science, and uses hands-on experiments and digital tools to enhance engagement. Activities include constructing simple circuits, experimenting with static electricity, and role-playing. Emphasis is placed on practical applications and safety. Findings highlight the effectiveness of a constructivist approach, where children build understanding through exploration. The study underscores the need for resources, teacher preparedness, and inclusive strategies to address diverse learning needs. This scenario provides insights into effective early childhood science education, emphasizing the potential to build a strong foundation for future learning and curiosity in young children.

AB  - Pre-service teachers often learn to teach in siloed methods courses despite evidence that interdisciplinary pedagogies benefit elementary school students. To address this discrepancy, six teacher educators initiated a two-year self-study to improve their practice. They co-created a shared module to integrate technology, literacy, and science content. The self-study was designed to answer the research question: what are the successes and challenges of implementing an interdisciplinary module within an elementary teacher education program? Findings relate to three main categories: teacher education pedagogies, use of technology tools, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Areas of promise for future integration are discussed.

AB  - Science communication is a diverse and transdisciplinary field and is taught most effectively when the skills involved are tailored to specific educational contexts. Few academic resources exist to guide the teaching of communication with non-scientific audiences for an undergraduate science context. This mixed methods study aimed to explore what skills for the effective communication of science with non-scientific audiences should be taught within the Australian Bachelor of Science. This was done to provide a basis from which to establish a teaching resource for undergraduate curriculum development. First, an extensive critique of academic literature was completed to distil the communication "skills" or "elements" commonly cited as being central to the effective communication of science from across the fields of science, communication, education, and science communication. A list of "key elements" or "core skills" was hence produced and systematically critiqued, edited, and validated by experts in the above four fields using a version of the Delphi method. Each of the skills identified was considered by experts to be mostly, highly, or absolutely essential, and the resource as a whole was validated as "Extremely applicable", within the context of teaching undergraduate science students to communicate with non-scientific audiences. The result of this study is an evidence-based teaching resource: "12 Core skills for effective science communication", which is reflective of current theory and practice. This resource may be used in teaching or as a guide to the development of communication skills for undergraduate science students in Australia and elsewhere.

AB  - The article presents the authors' experiences in designing a storytelling map guide for the botanical gardens of Palacký University, Czech Republic, from a pedagogical point of view. The authors introduce a three-pillared original concept. The overall educational contribution is a combination of educational, thematic and technological knowledge which supports successful engagement in the storytelling process. In the Storytelling Map Guide for the Botanical Gardens and Greenhouse Collections, the first pillar represents the educational aspect. Botanical knowledge and familiarity with the study area, i.e. the Palacký University Botanical Gardens, represent the thematic pillar. The technological pillar is covered by knowledge of software, cartography and application design skills, including an overview of contemporary storytelling applications. Finally, the educational impact and benefits to students of geoinformatics are discussed.

AB  - Background: Recent developments in STEM and computer science education put a strong emphasis on twenty-first-century skills, such as solving authentic problems. These skills typically transcend single disciplines. Thus, problem-solving must be seen as a multidisciplinary challenge, and the corresponding practices and processes need to be described using an integrated framework. Purpose: We present a fine-grained, integrated, and interdisciplinary framework of problem-solving for education in STEM and computer science by cumulatively including ways of problem-solving from all of these domains. Thus, the framework serves as a tool box with a variety of options that are described by steps and processes for students to choose from. The framework can be used to develop competences in problem-solving. Sources of evidence: The framework was developed on the basis of a literature review. We included all prominent ways of domain-specific problem-solving in STEM and computer science, consisting mainly of empirically orientated approaches, such as inquiry in science, and solely theory-orientated approaches, such as proofs in mathematics. Main argument: Since there is an increasing demand for integrated STEM and computer science education when working on natural phenomena and authentic problems, a problem-solving framework exclusively covering the natural sciences or other single domains falls short. Conclusions: Our framework can support both practice and research by providing a common background that relates the ways, steps, processes, and activities of problem-solving in the different domains to one single common reference. In doing so, it can support teachers in explaining the multiple ways in which science problems can be solved and in constructing problems that reflect these numerous ways. STEM and computer science educational research can use the framework to develop competences of problem-solving at a fine-grained level, to construct corresponding assessment tools, and to investigate under what conditions learning progressions can be achieved.

AB  - Interdisciplinary learning has become prevalent as a means of solving problems encountered in everyday life. Yet, there is a lack of experimental studies investigating strategies to facilitate interdisciplinary learning. This study explored the impacts of timing and types of instructional materials on the study of interdisciplinary subjects. A 2 × 2 quasi-experimental design was conducted in which the first independent variable was the timing of instructional materials (prior versus after) and the other was the types of gameplay (digital versus non-digital game). The dependent variables were learning outcomes and academic emotions. A sample of 134 seventh graders participated in the study. The results indicated that the timing of instructional materials resulted in significant differences on students' learning outcomes. Moreover, the effects of the timing of instructional materials in conjunction with the types of gameplay improved interdisciplinary learning outcomes and induced positive emotions. Discussions of the findings and pedagogical implications are provided.

AB  - There is growing interest in how to better prepare K-12 students to work with data. In this article, we assert that these discussions of teaching and learning must attend to the human dimensions of data work. Specifically, we draw from several established lines of research to argue that practices involving the creation and manipulation of data are shaped by a combination of personal experiences, cultural tools and practices, and political concerns. We demonstrate through two examples how our proposed humanistic stance highlights ways that efforts to make data personally relevant for youth also necessarily implicate cultural and sociopolitical dimensions that affect the design and learning opportunities in data-rich learning environments. We offer an interdisciplinary framework based on literature from multiple bodies of educational research to inform design, teaching and research for more effective, responsible, and inclusive student learning experiences with and about data.

AB  - Purpose: The study investigated how various school subjects can be integrated into archaeology teaching and how this could lead students towards empathy and a more sustainable worldview. Design/methodology/approach: To meet the purpose of this multiple-case study, optional archaeology course development (2011-2019) and students' questionnaires and feedback group A (2018) and group B (2019) and various empirical material, was analysed in cross-case methods. Findings: Archaeology interdisciplinarity and analysing long-term human behaviour supports an understanding of human nature, emphasizes empathy and tolerance, and encourages social cohesion. Research limitations/implications: The study was carried out in Estonia as a multiple-case study and further research, especially in the empathy part, is needed for further conclusions. Practical implications: Archaeology is interdisciplinary and therefore as a school subject it links together various and sometimes abstract subjects. It gives an understanding of long-term human behaviour, which allows developing students' empathy and tolerance.

AB  - STEAM education puts professional learning communities on the agenda by requiring teacher collaboration along with disciplinary integrity. In this study, a professional learning community in STEAM education was investigated by observing 49 teachers from different disciplines working in different districts during 16 weeks of interdisciplinary training and their practice with students. Teachers' perceptions of skills teaching self-efficacy, design self-efficacy and perceptions of interdisciplinary teaching were assessed using pre-post tests. The research concluded that the STEAM professional learning community study positively improved teachers' perceptions of skill teaching self-efficacy and interdisciplinary teaching, but was not sufficient to develop design self-efficacy. It was found that teachers' views of practice were positive and that interdisciplinary collaboration contributed to this. In light of the research findings, it was suggested that the use of professional learning communities in STEAM education may be an effective example of the interdisciplinary functioning of hands-on workshops.

AB  - STEM education is an interdisciplinary educational implementation, and can easily be designed via collaborative efforts of teachers in order to provide students with comprehensive, meaningful and unique learning experiences. For effective STEM practices, the role of teachers is very important. The teachers who are able to handle STEM education are supposed to integrate different disciplines in the teaching/learning situations in the achievement of course objectives. In this sense, awareness and intention of pre-service teachers have a very important place for their future professional implementations. In this study, pre-service teachers' awareness of and intention towards STEM education were examined. The study adopted one group pre-test post-test research design. The participants were composed of 192 pre-service teachers in the departments of Computer Education and Instructional Technology, Science Education, Elementary Mathematics Education and Turkish Language Education in a state university in central Anatolia. The results revealed that the participants who could adopt STEM education, make use of interdisciplinary activities, and who were interested in developing their interdisciplinary knowledge were more aware of STEM and had positive intention towards STEM education.

AB  - Group work is often used in university courses. This article examines group work in a widely interdisciplinary holography course that combines both art and science, for students from the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. In these interdisciplinary teams, how much specialization of labor (dividing work according to students' pre-existing abilities or personal interests) is acceptable? We present student survey responses regarding their attitudes toward interdisciplinary group work, and their practices in dividing the work, to determine how much specialization of labor is taking place within the interdisciplinary teams. The surveys indicate a mix of approaches among groups concerning the division of labor based on prior skills. In the presence of specialization of labor, students learned from their partners and displayed a positive attitude toward working with someone from a different discipline. We believe that the intriguing nature of the holography projects helped many students avoid dividing the work according to their prior skills, and helped them see the value of working in a widely interdisciplinary team.

AB  - Primary literature searching and the utility of research articles in chemistry teaching and instructions provide connections between conceptual understanding and the application of chemical knowledge. Article citation tracking, an often-neglected dimension in literature exploration, expands information seeking and provides opportunities to track how the reported breakthroughs of a research article are utilized and how the science behind the work progresses. Tracking published works that cite an article can be an effective methodology to gauge the impact of the work not just on the chemical sciences but also on other fields, thus highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of chemistry. The activity reported herein explores the utility of article citation tracking as an exercise for students to realize the potential impact of a published work and how the findings, whether infinitesimal or grand, contribute to creating knowledge and their applications in dealing with contemporary issues. The activity uses citation databases and indexing platforms for the learners to generate information such as the type of documents that cite a paper, the field or subject area of the citing articles, and the evaluation of the reasons for citing the work. Implemented among students taking introductory chemistry classes, encompassing psychology, medical technology, and nursing students, the exercise captures the enhancement of information-gathering skills, effectively incorporating research into classroom instructions and promoting critical thinking among students. Anchoring on an active cognition framework that weaves information and extracts related scientific concepts, this exercise addresses the adoption of strategies serving the global drive for sustainability in science education.

AB  - Education on sustainability is a crucial goal that requires a transformative shift in teacher education to drive meaningful changes oriented to action. A cross-sectional study with an exploratory design investigated preservice science teachers' perceptions regarding teaching sustainable citizenship, specifically focusing on the climate crisis and earthquakes-tsunamis. The study was conducted in two Chilean universities with similar teacher preparation programs. The team designed a podcast series, which was used and evaluated by the 13 participants through action research. Three group discussions explored their perceptions of the resources, as well as the aims and challenges of teaching sustainable citizenship and the podcasts. We used Grounded Theory steps, including triangulation by the researchers to ensure reliability, to qualitatively analyse the data. The results reveal a constraint on teaching in areas where the participants lacked the necessary preparation and background knowledge as students and preservice teachers. The main challenges were related to interdisciplinarity, the social dimension of socio-scientific issues and context-responsive teaching methods. The perceived aims were the development of students' critical thinking, informed positioning, and encouraging active citizen participation. Preservice teachers found the podcast series to be a valuable new epistemic and pedagogical resource that can support their efforts to teach sustainable citizenship and implement pedagogical strategies. The autonomous usage of the device triggered reflection processes, particularly regarding the human rights perspective, which unveiled the socio-political dimensions inherent in science education. It promoted personal re-positioning as active citizens and educators and empowered them to seek out and pursue the changes needed to reshape future classrooms. We discuss these findings in the context of teacher preparation and the use of educational technology in teacher education.

AB  - Science education has historically been viewed both as a tool to advance competitiveness as well as to improve the human condition. However, science education as it is enacted at a systemic level often presents itself in over-simplified (and typically Westernized) form that does not fully lend teachers and students the opportunity to explore the relationship between science and peace. This article explores science education literature through the lens of peace education frameworks to look for opportunities to explicitly acknowledge the possibility for the integration between these two fields. The review revealed four major themes in science education literature with connections to peace education, including (1) 'science for all' initiatives, (2) science-technology-society and socio-scientific issues movements, (3) decolonization and diversity, and (4) science education as political activism. This article provides recommendations for emphasizing these themes in the context of science education standards, teaching resources, and teacher education programs.

AB  - The integration of biology with mathematics and computer science mandates the training of students capable of comfortably navigating among these fields. We address this formidable pedagogical challenge with the creation of transdisciplinary modules that guide students toward solving realistic problems with methods from different disciplines. Knowledge is gradually integrated as the same topic is revisited in biology, mathematics, and computer science courses. We illustrate this process with a module on the homeostasis and dynamic regulation of red blood cell production, which was first implemented in an introductory biology course and will be revisited in the mathematics and computer science curricula.

AB  - Developing student self-efficacy and conceptualizing the importance of core ideas are seen as important learning areas in science education. Such core ideas can be elucidated with respect to the science discipline as well as interdisciplinary learning. Schools can be expected to promote high levels of students' self-efficacy in acquiring major disciplinary ideas and guiding students toward recognizing the importance of gaining work and life skills. This research sought to develop models describing students' gains in perceived self-efficacy and importance of work and life skills as well as indicating the relationship with both disciplinary and interdisciplinary core ideas in science education. Using a validated instrument, data were collected from Grade 8 (n = 218) (14-15 years old) and Grade 11 (n = 95) (17-18 years old) students. Models were created based on confirmatory factor analysis and parallel analysis. This research shows that there is need to make changes in secondary school studies so as to more clearly recognize a framework for both disciplinary and interdisciplinary core ideas, shown to be important for enabling students to prepare for their future life and careers.

AB  - Today's school students are faced with complex and harmful global challenges that they will need to address. The ability to think critically and creatively, to work in interdisciplinary teams and to understand the importance of a healthy planet for all life will be key to success. Education, including school education, has a major role in helping humanity achieve this. We argue that transformations in both the curriculum and teaching are required. We draw upon Young's (2008) 'powerful knowledge' and the rather different approach of an 'aims-based curriculum' found in Reiss and White (2013) to propose curricula and associated pedagogies that can potentially address the global challenges of our times. We offer examples of what learning might look like to achieve these aims, paying particular attention to school science education, as science will need to play an important role if these global challenges are to be successfully met.

AB  - The Advanced Interdisciplinary Research Laboratory (AIRLab) is a team-based multidisciplinary research course that focuses on the development of advanced skills including critical thinking, limits of knowledge awareness, metacognition, autonomy, professional capacity, and decision making in complex environments. For many students, AIRLab represents a first attempt at autonomous research, and as such, instructors emphasize teamwork skills development by way of the Kolb Learning Style Inventory and Agile project management techniques necessary for effective research progress. Recent AIRLab course refinements--by way of the introduction of weekly reflection reports, a new digital project management platform, a revised course marking scheme with greater focus on teamwork contributions, and the inclusion of the Earth Science discipline--has improved student learning and driven the course into new directions of interdisciplinary research. In this case, a novel decay-monitoring vessel was designed, permitting for continuous, multifaceted investigations of decay processes that govern fossilization.

AB  - This article describes the design and initial implementation of a multidisciplinary, integrative learning course on the art and science of virtual worlds. The course combines complementary disciplines -- Computing, Physics, and Narrative Art -- in a single general education course for first-year students. The course attempts to incorporate narrative design elements with the scientific considerations and technological tools necessary to create immersive environments. The intended outcome of this course is for students to have an engaging, team-based, interdisciplinary learning experience which will allow them to build their integrative learning skills. The initial offering of the course did not go as planned but provided insight into future course revisions (e.g. more emphasis on coding skills, a shift in technologies used) which may enable the course to better achieve its intended goals.

AB  - The importance of developing students' argumentation skills is well established across the curriculum: students should grasp how claims are made and supported in different disciplines. One challenge is to follow and thereby agree with or critique the arguments of others, which requires perspective-taking, in tracing these other reasons and reasoning. This challenge is increased when disciplines construct argumentation and perspective-taking differently. Here, we consider the role of perspective-taking in argumentation within and between science education and pluralistic religious education, where the former aims at the justification of scientific claims and the latter at both an empathetic understanding of different religions and worldviews, and personal reasoning. We interpretively analyze student data to identify salient features of students' strategies to perspective-taking within argumentation. Data from 324 pupils across nine schools are explored in relation to students' challenges in perspective-taking, strategies for perspective-taking within argumentation, and the use of perspective-taking to construct personal argumentation. The analysis shows some barriers to perspective-taking within argumentation, the range of students' perspective-taking strategies within argumentation, and how personal argumentation could hermeneutically build upon perspective-taking strategies. The importance and implications of perspective-taking within argumentation across the curriculum are considered highlighting challenges in the etic/emic shift, both within the individual subject as well as across them, and some reflections on how this provides a fresh pedagogical perspective on the science/religions debate are made. To end, we conclude with the wider challenges for disciplines and perspective-taking across schooling and university.

AB  - The inclusion of socioscientific issues (SSIs) in the science curriculum is a well-established trend internationally. Apart from claims about its innate value, one of the rationales for this approach is its potential for helping to counter declining interest and participation. SSIs involve the use of science and are of interest to society, also raising ethical and moral dilemmas. Introducing such problems presents a significant and usually cross-disciplinary challenge to curriculum developers and teachers. The aim of this paper is to examine how this challenge has been met when judged against contemporary views of the issues concerned. It first explores how SSIs have been interpreted in an important and innovative science course for students aged 14-16 in England, entitled Twenty First Century Science. This paper analyses the Twenty First Century Science textbooks, focusing in detail on two SSIs, reproductive genetic technology and climate change. For each of these issues, the key ideas present in the social science literature surrounding the problems are outlined. This review is then used as an analytical framework to examine how the issues are presented in the textbooks. It is argued in this paper that the perspectives the textbooks take on these issues largely do not include perspectives from social science disciplines. It goes on to suggest that the development of future SSI-based curricula needs to take account of these wider, often interdisciplinary, perspectives.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss the individuals' "roles", "responsibilities", and "routine activities", along with their "goals" and "intentions" in two different contexts--a school science context and a university research context--using sociological lenses. We highlight the distinct characteristics of both contexts to suggest new design strategies for STEM learning environments in school science context. We collected our research data through participant observations, field notes, group conversations, and interviews. Our findings indicate that school science practices were limited to memorizing and replicating science content knowledge through lectures and laboratory activities. Simple-structured science activities were a means to engage school science students in practical work and relate the theoretical concepts to such work. Their routine activities were to succeed in schooling objectives. In university research settings, the routine activities had interdisciplinary dimensions representing cognitive, social, and material dimensions of scientific practice. Such routine activities were missing in the practices of school science. We found that the differences between school and university research settings were primarily associated with individuals' "goals" and "intentions", which resulted in different social structures. In school settings, more authentic social structure can evolve if teachers trust their students and allow them to share the social and epistemic authorities through establishing mentorship. We do not expect school science students to perform the tasks of scientists in the same manner, yet the desired school science activities should include mentorship roles and interdisciplinary perspectives and encourage school science students to pursue unanswered questions without looking for the right answer.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the formulation of science education curriculum in Indonesian Islamic universities through an integrated paradigm of science and religion. This study used literature review method to form a knowledge metaphor. Because this integration pattern covered philosophical, methodological, material, and strategic levels, it could not be normatively measured. The integrated paradigm of science and religion should be implemented in an interdisciplinary integrated curriculum. Both science and religion should be concentrically distributed to distinction courses to well-formulate the integrated curriculum.

AB  - Art and technology have always been very tightly intertwined, presenting strong influences on each other. On the other hand, technological evolution led to today's digital media landscape, elaborating mediated communication tools, thus providing new creative means of expression (i.e., new-media art). Rich-media interaction can expedite the whole process into an augmented schooling experience though art cannot be easily enclosed in classical teaching procedures. The current work focuses on the deployment of a modern-art web-guide, aiming at enhancing traditional approaches with machine-assisted blended-learning. In this perspective, "machine" has a two-folded goal: to offer highly-interdisciplinary multimedia services for both in-class demonstration and self-training support, and to crowdsource users' feedback, as to train artificial intelligence systems on painting movements semantics. The paper presents the implementation of the "Istoriart" website through the main phases of Analysis, Design, Development, and Evaluation, while also answering typical questions regarding its impact on the targeted audience. Hence, elaborating on this constructive case study, initial hypotheses on the multidisciplinary usefulness, and contribution of the new digital services are put into test and verified.

AB  - This research is a needs analysis study aimed at developing a curriculum based on an interdisciplinary context-based learning approach within the 10th-grade physics course, focusing on the electricity and magnetism unit. The research was designed according to the case study model and data were collected from expert, teacher, and student sample groups through questionnaires and interview forms. Descriptive statistics were utilized for quantitative data analysis, while content analysis technique was employed for qualitative data. The results indicated that the physics curriculum continued to maintain a disciplinary perspective and a classical understanding of physics, with insufficient connection with daily life and adaptation to contemporary conditions. Similar results were identified in the 10th-grade physics textbooks and in-class instructional practices concerning the unit of electricity and magnetism. In this respect, the research identified the needs for developing a curriculum based on an interdisciplinary context-based learning approach to address these negative results. These needs, while enhancing interdisciplinary context-based understanding, can also contribute to the emergence of various opportunities and different perspectives in physics education. It is recommended to identify needs in other subfields of physics as well and develop curricula designed with an interdisciplinary context-based approach for more effective and efficient physics education.

AB  - Purpose: This article argues that in social science teacher education general demands for teacher reflection overlap with subject-specific reflective demands. This calls for conceptual frameworks that account for an extended reflectivity, encompassing both teacher reflection and the subject-specific approach to representing controversial issues. Approach: Concepts of reflective practice and meta-reflexivity in teacher education are presented, and a discussion is provided regarding the challenges inherent in teaching social sciences as a multidisciplinary subject. Furthermore, aspects of meta-reflectivity are identified in a German teacher competence framework (PKP). To enable a broader analysis, frameworks from the field of epistemic cognition are introduced. Findings: Utilizing frameworks of epistemic cognition enables a detailed investigation of how social science teachers manage subject-specific challenges. Epistemic reflexivity offers a concept of teacher reflection that enables a new perspective on connecting theoretical reflection in pre-service teacher education programs with later reflective practice.

AB  - The Arts and Science Honours Academy (ASHA) is a unique interdisciplinary undergraduate honours programme at a large research-intensive university in Canada. Data were collected in early 2020 from 108 past and present students, representing the first eleven cohorts of the programme. Triangulating results from quantitative and qualitative analyses, we describe the ASHA students' educational and social experience during their time at university and, for those who have graduated, their post-graduate activities. Situating our investigation within previous literature examining interdisciplinary undergraduate learning communities and high impact practices, we assess whether students from arts and science disciplines experienced the programme differently, and which aspects of the programme were most impactful. We find that academically, students reported benefiting from the exposure to interdisciplinary thought, the opportunity to do research, and the study abroad requirement. Socially, students reported benefiting from the connections they formed with a small cohort of high achieving peers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. While science students reported benefitting the most from ASHA socially, arts students were more likely to indicate that the programme influenced their careers following graduation. These findings provide evidence to support the creation and design of future interdisciplinary undergraduate programmes.

AB  - Data science is inherently collaborative as individuals across fields and sectors use quantitative data to answer relevant questions. As a result, there is a growing body of research regarding how to teach interdisciplinary collaboration skills. However, much of the work evaluating methods of teaching statistics and data science collaboration relies primarily on self-reflection data. Additionally, prior research lacks detailed methods for assessing the quality of collaboration skills. In this case study, we present a method for teaching statistics and data science collaboration, a framework for identifying elements of effective collaboration, and a comparative case study to evaluate the collaboration skills of both a team of students and an experienced collaborator on two components of effective data science collaboration: structuring a collaboration meeting and communicating with a domain expert. Results show that the students could facilitate meetings and communicate comparably well to the experienced collaborator, but that the experienced collaborator was better able to facilitate meetings and communicate to develop strong relationships, an important element for high-quality and long-term collaboration. Further work is needed to generalize these findings to a larger population, but these results begin to inform the field regarding effective ways to teach specific data science collaboration skills.

AB  - In higher education, student retention challenges and advancing student diversity are not new. Such institutional student retention challenges and student diversity promotions continue to require more focus and effort. A means to help address student retention and improve student diversity through faculty engagement in classrooms is inclusive pedagogy. In this study, we inform researchers and practitioners about the current state of inclusive pedagogical research, including gaps addressing further needs of inclusive pedagogical research from a multi-disciplinary perspective, including science, technology, engineering, education, math, humanities, management, and economics. We also share a non_STEM-Focused versus STEM-Focused inclusive pedagogy literature perspective. Using the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) framework, we reviewed 304 articles to help shed light on existing inclusive pedagogy, focusing on three core competencies: inclusive communications, inclusive pedagogy practices, and the design of inclusive curriculum. Based on our discussion of findings and related implications for future research, we conclude that inclusive pedagogical research warrants improvement across all core competencies and academic disciplines to strengthen improvement of this research field. This study contributes to researchers and practitioners, especially those focusing inclusive pedagogy in classrooms, as well as the body of inclusive pedagogy knowledge.

AB  - Background: As the number of computer science (CS) jobs become increasingly available in this country and computing skills become essential tools for managing all aspects of our personal lives, CS is quickly becoming an essential element of K-12 education and recently, there has been increased attention to bringing computer science to the elementary grades. However, with a schedule that emphasizes literacy and mathematics, and other subjects competing for instructional time, creating opportunities for CS in the elementary school day is challenging. This study aimed to address this problem by investigating the use of problem-based transdisciplinary modules (i.e., "Time4CS" modules) that combined English language arts (ELA), science, and social studies lessons with the Code.org "Fundamentals" CS education program. Results: indicated that teachers who taught Time4CS modules completed more CS lessons than teachers who did not teach the modules. Further, across all classrooms, completing a higher percentage of non-grade level assigned Code.org Fundamentals lessons (i.e., Code.org lessons above or below grade level that were available to teachers, but not required for their particular grade level) was positively associated with students' achievement outcomes on state ELA and mathematics tests. Additionally, higher amounts of interdisciplinary teaching practices were associated with higher student achievement, specifically students' state assessment ELA scores. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that transdisciplinary problem-based modules that integrate the teaching of CS with other subject areas are a feasible way to bring more CS opportunities to younger learners. Moreover, it showed that implementing such modules is linked to more positive student academic achievement outcomes. With attentive revision, the modules featured in this study may be useful tools for elementary schools. These findings have implications for researchers, school district administrators, and those individuals who are in-charge of public policy initiatives seeking ways to bring CS to all elementary school students. Specifically, they highlight that it is possible to make time in the elementary school day for CS, and that there are no negative consequences for core subjects (e.g., ELA and mathematics).

AB  - A strong theoretical approach with a specific focus on disciplinary research characterizes the common science master's education in the Netherlands. However, a work-based learning (WBL) approach may as well be expedient and suitable for science education at master's level. In this paper, a case study is presented of a WBL-program designed for an academic setting: the one year Science, Business and Policy (SBP) master's track, offered at the Faculty of Science and Engineering of the University of Groningen. The paper describes the design and curriculum of the track, including its underlying theoretical framework, courses, multidisciplinary projects and work placements. Based on the SBP-track's design we identified six possible indicators of a successful elaboration of an academic WBL-program: the SBP-track (1) is designed in response to the Bologna process; (2) is offered fully within the curriculum of a master's program of a research university; (3) requires a sufficient academic level and disciplinary knowledge at entrée; (4) follows an educational project approach; (5) focuses on the integration and implementation of knowledge; and (6) applies learning objectives that are specifically formulated to match the WBL educational method. A directed content analysis of SBP work placements revealed an increase in the number of SBP-students between 2003 and 2019, with an overrepresentation of life science students, as well as a large variety of real-case problems addressed for both business and policy organisations diverse in sector, size and region. Students' grades showed a positive correlation between the initial theoretical preparation and the report made during the work placement. In conclusion, the societal interpretation of the Bologna process has been implemented successfully with SBP, by combining academic learning with gaining professional experience using a WBL-approach.

AB  - This article presents ideas and narratives of an experiment on the concept of energy developed for an honors seminar on energy and a mechanics course. We argue that energy is an idea best taught in an interdisciplinary manner. While most physics courses explore ideas such as mechanical energy and conservation of energy, it is imperative that a more practical view of energy as fuel be addressed since this has particular relevance to our students' future. We believe energy cannot be discussed without talking about entropy and that a proper introduction to energy can only be made by simultaneously discussing the idea of entropy. In this article, we present one lab activity related to carbon emissions from bicycling, designed to help elucidate this idea through the use of conceptual metaphors and embodied learning. The learning goals of the activity were to encourage students to understand that energy and entropy are intricately related and to have students gain a deeper understanding of the concepts by considering and discussing ways in which they apply to different contexts. We discuss the rationale, implementation, and outcomes of the activity.

AB  - Mathematics plays a crucial role in physics. This role is brought about predominantly through the building, employment, and assessment of mathematical models, and teachers and educators should capture this relationship in the classroom in an effort to improve students' achievement and attitude in both physics and mathematics. But although there are overwhelming amounts of literature on modeling in science and mathematics education, the interdisciplinary position is seldom addressed explicitly. Furthermore, there has been a striking lack of exposure of the question of how future teachers, who are largely educated in a mono-disciplinary fashion, can best become equipped to introduce genuinely interdisciplinary teaching activities to their future pupils. This paper presents some preliminary reflections upon a graduate course, which aims to prepare future physics and mathematics teachers for interdisciplinary teaching, and which has been designed on the basis of influential theoretical expositions of the concept of interdisciplinarity.
