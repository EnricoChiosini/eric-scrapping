AB  - This research addresses the problem of how to tackle STEM education and its transformation into STEAM education in an inclusive school. It highlights the need for communication competence in collaborative teaching supported by problem-based (PBL), project-based (PrBL) and game-based (GBL) learning. At the same time, it is necessary to highlight the importance of arts in all the listed innovative forms of learning and teaching, as teamwork and cooperation between the members of these teams are extremely important. The key competence of this participation in the mentioned forms of knowledge is communication competence, which is manifested in students' self-confidence/lack of self-confidence, in their level of well-being, collaboration, motivation, their active role and awareness. The empirical research was conducted on a sample of eleven classes from six Slovenian-inclusive schools, with at least one student with SEN in each class. The research focused on the differences between students with and without SEN regarding their perception of STEAM lessons supported by gamification elements. The results showed that using innovative teaching methods can connect and positively affect STEAM, which, with the help of technology, engineering and art, consequently, improves a deeper understanding of the field of Science and Mathematics (S-tea-M).

AB  - The Graduate Partnerships Program (GPP), established in 2000, links universities with National Institutes of Health (NIH) laboratories for predoctoral training. Several partnerships required that students create collaborative dissertations between at least one NIH and one university research mentor. More than 60 students have entered into these co-mentored research collaborations, and many others established them even though not required. Much was learned about the experiences of these and other GPP students by using structured interviews as part of a formal self-study of the GPP in 2005. Complications of trying to work with two mentors are managed through careful program design and mentor selection. In the collaborative model, students develop a complex set of scientific and interpersonal skills. They lead their own independent research projects, drawing on the expertise of multiple mentors and acquiring skills at negotiating everyone's interests. They develop high levels of independence, maturity, flexibility, and the ability to see research questions from different perspectives. No evidence was found that co-mentoring diminishes the normally expected accomplishments of a student during the Ph.D. Multi-mentored dissertations require skills not all graduate students may possess this early in training, but for those who do, they can promote rapid and extensive development of skills needed for collaborative, interdisciplinary research.

AB  - There are myriad understandings of design that have evolved over time and vary by the industries and disciplines that practice it. In the engineering context, design is often described as a process or problem-solving ability. Through interviews with 12 experienced engineers, it was found that there are diverse understandings of the relationship between design and engineering. This qualitative study presented a classification of their perspectives through three emergent categories: the relationship between design and engineering, the proportion of design tasks within a job, and the level or stage of development where design occurs. A synthesis of the data revealed that engineers demonstrate an ownership of design within engineering and there are diverse understandings of how design occurs within engineering. The implications of these findings were discussed and recommendations were offered for engineering educators, researchers, and industry. Engineering educators can help prepare designers as catalysts to produce a more inclusive, holistic, and sustainably minded profession.

AB  - Despite calls for investigations that explore the efficacy of integrating literacy into science instruction, few researchers have conducted this cross-disciplinary research. Therefore, this study focused on determining the impact of a literacy-based approach to teaching science on secondary students' attitudes toward science and their achievement and engagement in physical science. This inquiry also focused on determining any differential effects for girls since females are often marginalized in science instruction and discouraged in choosing science careers. This mixed-methods study used quantitative measures and methods to determine the efficacy of integrating science and literacy and qualitative methods to describe the instructional activity in three experimental teachers' chemistry classes. Findings demonstrated the positive impact of integrating literacy into science on students' inquiry skills and improved attitudes toward science for girls. Appealing elements of the instructional activities are identified and described. Implications are provided for instruction and recommendations are offered for future research. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - The purpose is to contribute knowledge to the field regarding the role of aesthetic experience when young students participate in intertwined science-art activities in science class. More precisely, we scrutinise how science suggestions are shaped in students' processes of imagination when exploring animal's ecology. Data corpus comprises audio recordings, photographs, drawings and field notes. The school is located in Sweden and the participating students were between 6 and 7 years old (Swedish grade 1). Seven students and their teacher participated in the study. The dialogues were analysed by means of a practical epistemology analysis (PEA), based on Dewey and the later Wittgenstein. In addition, the analytical term pictorial relation is launched to analyse the visual language exposed in students' drawings. The results reveal that throughout the process, the young students in transaction with the contextual features, imagined suggestions and solutions to science-related issues. Facts and fiction, sense and nonsense blended when new solutions of pleasurable hiding-places for prey were aesthetically and imaginatively explored and designed. In addition, the students owned the problem throughout and developed agency, which resulted in novel science-art outcomes and the students' communicative repertoire was extended when involved in intertwined dialogues and art activities.

AB  - This study describes the development of a climate change SSIBL-STEAM program that was aligned to the Grade 6 elementary school national curriculum using the ADDIE model for design. The efficacy of the climate change SSIBL-STEAM program was investigated by measuring the impact of the program on cultivating elementary students' personalities (sociality, morality, emotion) and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics) competencies (convergence, creativity, challenge, caring). Twenty-five Grade 6 students and three public elementary school teachers participated in this study. Data were collected using two instruments designed to examine character and STEAM competencies before and after the program. Additionally, field notes and student learning outcomes were collected and qualitatively and quantitively analyzed. The results indicated that students improved significantly in their character and STEAM competencies, especially morality, emotion, and convergence factors. This study was expected to be an example of the combined approach with SSIBL and STEAM.

AB  - This article describes an undergraduate simulation that formulates Iraqi regimes following the removal of Saddam Hussein's Baathist regime. This exercise reinforces student comprehension and awareness for a range of legal and political topics--including group decision making, international law, diplomacy, and human rights--by actively engaging the students in policy formulation and group to group negotiations. In addition to presenting individual course concepts, this activity presents the advantages of multidisciplinary approaches by integrating related disciplines at the United States Air Force Academy. Contemporary social problems, foreign or domestic, require multifaceted solutions presented by particular specializations. Concerning the question of postwar Iraqi justice, political science students use their class expertise to design political institutions and legal studies. Students design the main legal apparatus as students from these respective disciplines then join together to execute the simulation. The four key components of active learning approaches--educational objectives, design parameters, procedures, and assessment and debriefing--are employed providing a full understanding of the goals, set-up, process, and advantages to synergizing across the curriculum for the issue of post-war Iraqi justice. The simulation has been successfully implemented three times with United States Air Force Academy cadets with feedback indicating positive results and providing inputs that modified the initial construct of the simulation.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of instructional methods based on a one-day informal science field experience comparing a teacher-centered methodology versus a student-centered (inquiry-based) methodology. The 5E learning cycle was selected as the framework for implementing the inquiry-based learning for the treatment groups as it provides the structure of the constructivist learning cycle (Duran & Duran, 2004). The research design followed a quasi-experimental design with a total of three control and three treatment groups representing two individual schools. Each school included at least one treatment and one control group. The study included 117 third grade students. Both groups were given a pre and post assessment measuring the impact of the instructional method of inquiry presented in the 5E format. An independent-measures t-test was used to analyze the results of the means for the post-test assessments (treatment and control) and the means of the retention assessments. Pre-tests indicated variations of prior knowledge between the control and treatment groups. Post-tests indicated similar results of knowledge gains. However, the retention tests for the treatment groups revealed students increased their knowledge from the time of their post-test. The control groups' retention results were similar to their post-test results indicating knowledge was maintained.

AB  - "Forensics," in its most universal sense, is defined as the use of science or technology in the investigation and establishment of facts or evidence for determining identity or relatedness. Most forensic reasoning is used for arguing legal matters. However, forensic studies are also used in agronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, and physics to identify the properties of materials or compare two different materials. The interdisciplinary nature of a forensics-based demonstration encourages science majors to move beyond their own narrow fields of study. This article presents a forensics-based demonstration that emphasizes the interconnectedness of biology, chemistry, and geology. This demonstration asks students to determine the purported origins of three soils collected from three different regions on a Hawaiian island. Students are guided step-by-step through a forensic analysis procedure using two data sets for determining each sample's origin. The 10 steps to be conducted to embed inquiry-based learning during the demonstration are presented. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - The defining task for undergraduate departments is the design of a major, including the number and content of courses as well as other requirements. Department members must weigh the desire to produce graduates superbly prepared for further study against the charge that the major requires too large a share of an undergraduate's course options. This dilemma is particularly striking for the sciences at undergraduate institutions where faculty are committed to the breadth of the liberal arts but also pride themselves on the number of students going on to graduate school or employment in scientific fields. Biochemistry and molecular biology (BMB) are often among the most demanding majors in terms of course requirements. In addition to the linear nature of all science programs, which hinders the flexibility of a major, BMB are interdisciplinary fields that integrate material from courses in different departments. Tension between contributing departments often leads to an increase in the number of required courses. Since 1992, the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) has supported a recommended curriculum for the bachelor's degree in BMB. In the years since it was developed, this curriculum has been modified to emphasize skills rather than coursework. In addition to defining core content in chemistry, biology, and allied fields, the society has published a list of skills to be achieved. Although expressed in language specific to the sciences, these skills mirror the learning outcomes recommended by the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) in its 2007 report, "College Learning for the New Global Century." Mapping the two sets of skills onto one another indicates where the ASBMB guidelines are strongest and where they might be supplemented. Through a survey of department chairs and instructors, the researchers sought to learn how widely the ASBMB-recommended curriculum and skills are understood by departments, at what levels the skills are introduced, what methods of pedagogy are employed, and how often open-ended research problems are presented to students. Broader-ranging questions about the role of BMB in liberal education were explored through interviews and open sessions at the 2007 ASBMB national meeting. This article reports the findings of the survey. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - It is becoming increasingly difficult to keep graduate students in forage and range science connected to producers and grazingland resources in the USA. Students must take an integrated systems approach to understanding the complexity of our grazinglands and their role in addressing critical issues. This can best be conveyed to the student by bringing together an array of expertise and providing exposure to diverse sites for these learning opportunities. Thus, a multidisciplinary graduate course was developed for students at U.S. universities that transports students to professionals in different ecoregions, and provides a hands-on approach to grazinglands education. In the first 5 years of the course, 59 students from 12 countries have represented 8 universities in the USA and Mexico. Student responses to the course have been positive. We believe this course fills a niche currently lacking in most graduate programs and provides a unique opportunity for students to interact with experts in every aspect of forage and range science. The personal and professional contacts, cross-cultural interactions, photographs, and potential for career direction are tangible items seldom attained in graduate education.

AB  - Biotechnology is an expanding area of scientific and community interest, one that it is important students understand because of its potential to impact on them and their communities. The issue for teachers and science and technology educators is how to provide learning experiences in this area. This paper draws on classroom-based research to describe the challenges teachers face and the successes they can achieve when teaching an interdisciplinary subject such as biotechnology. It describes the components of pedagogical content knowledge that teachers require to teach such a subject and highlights planning strategies to enhance teachers' PCK and subsequent classroom interactions. Evidence is provided that biotechnology engages student interest and that students can develop an understanding of the nature of biotechnology and associated conceptual and procedural learning outcomes.

AB  - In "The two cultures and the scientific revolution," C.P. Snow (1959) described the chasm between pure and applied science, on the one hand, and the arts and humanities, on the other. Snow was concerned that the complete lack of understanding between these "two cultures" would hamper the spread of the scientific/industrial revolution from rich nations to poor. Because of his conviction that this revolution had made lives longer and more comfortable for people of developed nations, he forcefully argued that the two intellectual cultures must be bridged--the sooner the better. The gap between these two cultures, of course, still exists. Meanwhile, the arts are neglected in primary and secondary schools. Further, the science vocabulary of adults in the U.S. appears to be so poor that a scientific theory is considered suspect simply because it is "just a theory". Such problems may create increased competition between the two cultures. A probable result would be short-sighted prescriptive measures that are at best worthless and at worst dangerous to the mission of bridging the two cultures. A better approach may be to examine interdisciplinary fields where this gap seems less wide, for clues to a bridge.

AB  - This study investigates the motivation of African American master's degree students in computing to pursue a PhD in Computing. Specifically, we sought to understand the motivation of those students attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the United States. Our framework was founded on the premise that an adequate theoretical rooting of broadening participation calls for reflections on the nature and practice of justice. Motivation, nonetheless, remained the core factor, albeit addressing it within a context of justice or lack thereof. The study shows that while most students seem intrinsically motivated by a desire to learn, leading to a likelihood to pursue a PhD, extrinsic factors such as funding and employability constitute the highest hindrance to such likelihood.

AB  - This paper describes how a second grade science unit on penguins became the ideal content to integrate with the physical education curriculum. The movement experiences reinforced the information students learned about penguins and helped students to gain a deeper understanding of penguin behaviors. Together, the physical education teacher and the classroom teacher collaborated on what content about penguins could be physically experienced by the students while also increasing their motor skills, strength, and flexibility. The activities also required students to apply their knowledge of the different types of penguins, the predators, and penguin habitats through participating in problem solving tasks and by using teamwork. This interdisciplinary lesson is a great way to integrate movement and science concepts and provide an exciting kinesthetic learning experience for students.

AB  - In this article, the authors explore how the 3C Model can be used to integrate other curriculum areas with mathematics, namely digital technologies. To illustrate the model, they provide a practical example of a teaching sequence. T he 3C Model is designed to create opportunities for applying reasoning and problem-solving skills and learning coding and algorithmic thinking using digital and physical devices. The model comprises three stages: Context of the problem (learning curriculum content within a contextual problem); Capabilities of the device (students are exposed to capabilities of software or physical computing devices in an exploratory or play-based activity); and Computational focus of the unit of work (an intentional and gradual shift in language from child-familiar terms to the more abstract representations of coding). The three stages are situated as the first three lessons of a 5 or 6 lesson sequence.

AB  - This quasi-experimental study aimed to examine content-area literacy instruction in comparison to a science-infused literacy instruction (SILI) to determine how these two approaches influenced 2nd grade students' ability to read and write science informational text and the students' attitude and motivation towards reading. After professional development, five teachers taught their classes twelve thematic lessons designed using either the content-area literacy (N = 37) or the SILI (N = 40) instruction to 2nd grade students. Teachers in both groups implemented thematic lessons that taught the life cycle of plants and included interactive read-alouds, graphic organizers, watching time lapse videos of plant growth, and reading digital texts independently and in small groups to support students in building the content knowledge and vocabulary necessary to write science informational texts. Students in the SILI group also participated in hands-on science activities including planting seeds and documenting plant growth, exploring the parts of a live basil plant, and taking walks outdoors to observe plants at various stages of the plant life cycle. Lessons took place over four weeks to assist students in acquiring science content knowledge so as to transfer this knowledge into science informational texts and to determine the influence of both instructional approaches on reading comprehension and reading attitude and motivation. Findings resulted in the content-area literacy instruction producing higher and statistically significant reading comprehension and writing rubric scores than the SILI group with medium effect sizes reported. The SILI group produced higher reading attitude and motivation scores, but these results were not statistically significant. Implications for both early childhood science and literacy classroom instruction as well as multiple implications for future research are discussed.

AB  - We developed an interactive online textbook that interleaves R programming activities with text as a way to facilitate students' understanding of statistical ideas while minimizing the cognitive and emotional burden of learning programming. In this exploratory study, we characterize the attitudes and experiences of 672 undergraduate students as they used our online textbook as part of a 10-week introductory course in statistics. Students expressed negative attitudes and concerns related to R at the beginning of the course, but most developed more positive attitudes after engaging with course materials, regardless of demographic characteristics or prior programming experience. Analysis of a subgroup of students revealed that change in attitudes toward R may be linked to students' patterns of engagement over time and students' perceptions of the learning environment.

AB  - Drawing is a long-standing tool in the natural sciences, but training in this skill set has lapsed. We describe the impacts of field sketching instruction on the teaching practices of faculty and the experiences of students in two sections of a freshman-level course on natural history. We examine self-reported data from participating faculty and students. We focus on their perspectives of drawing and natural history practices before and after drawing training and a field journal requirement. Faculty reported positive shifts in their views of the value and feasibility of incorporating drawing in their courses. We observed positive shifts in students' attitudes about drawing and appreciation of nature, as indicated by students' field journal entries and survey responses. Given the sample size (n = 26 students, n = 2 faculty), our ability to draw inference is constrained. Thus, we present these results to provide context for the overall process of efforts to integrate drawing more fully into natural science courses. For university instructors interested in incorporating drawing into their natural science courses, we also provide advice rooted in the literature and best practices of art-science integration. Our results suggest that on-going, artist-facilitated training for faculty and students can enhance the experience of using drawing in natural history courses and reconnect natural scientists at all career levels to drawing as a valuable, professional tool.

AB  - This article explores how English-language learners' writing evolved during a first-year seminar in science course aimed at developing students' argumentation skills. We highlight how a science communications course was paired with a weekly academic English course in the context of a highly coordinated and enriched first-year experience program for international students. This collaborative model provided students with multiple opportunities for discussion and feedback about their writing. An analysis of the data, including student grades and reflections, revealed significant improvements in students' writing structure and abilities to construct evidence-based arguments. Students also perceived positive changes in their critical thinking and specific writing skills for science. This research is a promising example of how collaboration between science and language faculty leads to the development and facilitation of targeted activities and assignments that improve English-language learners' science communication skills in their first year of study at a university.

AB  - This study employed a multi-phased process to guide the development of an approach for integrating socio-scientific issues (SSI) and science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education in a way that can reform how science is taught in schools to improve scientific literacy. This approach can help teachers connect science authentically to real-world issues that have social and cultural relevance to students' everyday lives. To demonstrate how the approach could be used for curriculum development, the authors defined the dimensions and key principles of SSI-based STEAM teaching and translated the approach into a climate change program by using a 6E inquiry model, which emphasizes an "enactment" stage. This program was used to discuss the benefits and challenges of employing an SSI-based STEAM approach in classroom contexts. We conclude by discussing implications for using this approach to improve science learning opportunities in cross-cultural contexts, and we raise questions about the need for future research.

AB  - Integrating science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) education has become an emphasis in many countries' K-12 curricula. Design-based learning is an instructional approach that allows students to learn STEAM in more integrated ways than the traditional method. Using design thinking as a pedagogical framework, design-based learning engages students in designing solutions to real-life and human-centred problems. In this process, students must use creativity, visual arts, and design thinking as well as disciplinary knowledge and skills. Of great importance here is creative confidence -- a belief in one's own creative ability. However, research investigating the influence of design-based learning on students' creative confidence is still scare. This mixed-methods study examined 31 eighth-grade students' creative confidence before and after being challenged to design user-friendly tables. This design-based learning lasted for 12 50-minute periods that were scheduled over four weeks. We used a Likert-type questionnaire to collect quantitative data and recorded classroom discourse to gather qualitative data. Using non-parametric statistics, we found that the students significantly improved their creative confidence. Using a content analysis method, we identified crucial sources of this improvement and thus formed recommendations for how to foster students' creative confidence within the context of design-based learning.

AB  - Several studies have shown significant improvements in the attitudes and perceptions of healthcare professional students toward interprofessional education (IPE) immediately following intervention with IPE courses. However, there remains little evidence on the lasting effects of IPE courses and the long-term influences of these IPE experiences are poorly documented. The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term effects of an intensive, ten-week interprofessional gross anatomy dissection course at McMaster University. Attitudes and perceptions of past participants towards interprofessional learning were evaluated, now that they have started working with other healthcare professionals outside of the IPE course setting. Thirty-four past participants who have clinical experience working in interprofessional settings or are currently working in the healthcare field completed a follow-up questionnaire consisting of a modified Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) and open-ended questions. Quantitative analysis revealed a significant decrease in their attitude towards teamwork and collaboration and respect for other health professions, but a significant improvement in their understanding of roles and responsibilities compared to their results immediately after the IPE intervention. Qualitative analysis of open-ended questions revealed several themes such as developing interprofessional competencies, developing relationships, and remembering the strengths of the IPE dissection course. The results of this study indicate that the IPE experience in anatomy was highly valued by the students and that past participants maintain a clear understanding of their scope of practice, but the reality of clinical practice may have eroded gains made in the program.

AB  - In the United States, culturally responsive computing is a framework that aims to support broadening the participation of racially and linguistically diverse children in computing and technology education through bottom-up interventions that are community-oriented, technology rich, and culturally dynamic. Despite the important role that youth sports play in many local neighborhoods and communities across demographic groups there is only a small amount of research on developing culturally responsive computing education that incorporates these activities. We report findings from a culturally responsive computing collaboration between computing education researchers and coaches, mentors, and academic staff who ran a youth boxing program that predominantly served African American children. The purpose of the collaboration was to learn about and represent the adults' expertise and knowledge in the co-development of culturally responsive computing activities. Using an emergent mixed methods research design, we collected qualitative data (i.e., interviews and group discussions) and quantitative data (i.e., pre- and post-surveys) throughout the collaboration. We analyzed these data to study how coaches, mentors, and staff members brought their knowledge and expertise to bear on the co-development of culturally responsive computing activities for the youth boxing program. Our findings show how the coaches, mentors, and academic staff used their expertise and knowledge in ways that leveraged boxing culture to go beyond boxing itself in the co-development of the activities. In addition, even when connections between computing and boxing did not appear authentically motivated this did not negate the adults' engagement with the culturally responsive computing project. These findings have implications for anti-deficit theorizing about authenticity and inauthenticity in the co-development of culturally responsive computing in youth sports contexts. The construction of authenticity in culturally responsive computing might be less understood as a direct translation from community into education and more so as a negotiation between locally defined demarcations of what is considered authentic and inauthentic.

AB  - Connections among the mathematics, science, and engineering disciplines have been recognized and affirmed in national standards. For example, the application of mathematical ideas and skills within science has been highlighted in national science standards for over 20 years. More recently, the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS; NGSS Lead States, 2013) incorporated computational thinking (Wing, 2006), engineering design, and a K-12 strand of performance expectations in engineering, technology, and applications of science. To ensure opportunities for mathematical development within a science context, a focus on mathematical modeling can be productive (Stohlman, 2018): a process of using mathematics to represent, analyze, and make predictions regarding complex, reality-based phenomena (Garfunkel & Montgomery, 2019). The importance of developing students' capacities for mathematical modeling at every grade level is underrealized, yet it offers noteworthy advantages for deep mathematical learning while also charting a way forward in mathematics and science integration. This article examines how an elementary teacher integrated mathematics and science to engage fourth graders in an authentic inquiry exploring sustainability solutions for their school.

AB  - Vertical connections, constructed using inquiry, give students the skills to reach new heights in both their academic and local communities. In this article, the authors present inquiry projects, developed by middle level teachers, to ensure that students use higher-level thinking skills to improve the community. Each project is connected to the previous year's to give students a deeper understanding of how research can help citizens build a sustainable community. Teachers work together to plan field studies and guide students in presenting their findings to others in the community using models, PowerPoint presentations, a web accessible database, and reports from field investigations. The projects are as follows: (1) healthy marine ecosystems--sixth grade; (2) interdisciplinary science: biodiversity and development--seventh grade; and (3) collaborating to create a better biosphere--eighth grade.

AB  - This study aimed to recognize upper-secondary school science teachers' perceptions of the meaning, importance, and integrating mechanisms of science, technology, engineering, math (STEM) education, taking in to account the differences between the science teachers' perceptions according to their specialties, years of experience, and degrees. A closed-ended questionnaire was distributed among 700 science teachers (biology, physics, and chemistry) in Riyadh, and 255 teachers responded. The results showed a strong alignment in the upper-secondary school science teachers' perceptions of the meaning and the importance of STEM education, although there was less of a consensus regarding the integrating mechanisms. There were statistically significant differences in the physics teachers' perceptions of STEM meaning, although there were otherwise no significant differences by specialty in the science teachers' perceptions of the importance of STEM education and its integration mechanisms. Furthermore, the teachers showed no statistically significant differences in STEM's meaning, importance, or integrating mechanisms according to their years of experience. Based on the results, recommendations included intensifying professional development programs on utilizing technology, engineering, and mathematics in learning science concepts and application.

AB  - Practice-based interprofessional education (IPE), a key feature in developing a collaboration-ready workforce, is poorly integrated in healthcare curriculums. This study aimed to synthesise educator perspectives on implementing practice-based IPE and develop recommendations to inform sustainable practice-based IPE. An ethnographic case study was carried out at a school of allied health. Data collection involved six observations, 11 interviews and a review of eight documents. Reflexive thematic analysis, informed by Normalisation Process Theory, established two key themes. First, we found that strategic planning is needed, with a coherent implementation agenda and planned reflection on activities. Second, building partnerships with placement partners was identified as essential. This can be achieved by supporting and championing practice-based IPE activities developed by placement sites and establishing how university and clinical educators can work collaboratively to deliver sustainable practice-based IPE. These conditions create a favourable environment for normalising practice-based IPE in healthcare curriculums, benefitting students, patients, and the overall healthcare service.

AB  - Using findings from a 4-year research and development effort, we propose an updated model of sheltered instruction for science classrooms that leverages the opportunities provided by the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) to better support multilingual learners in middle and high school science. Using data from teacher implementation logs and interviews, we examine how secondary grades science teachers' participation in our professional learning framework and subsequent enactments of an initial set of project instructional practices led these teachers to articulate nuanced and strategic adaptations to the initial practices to better meet the needs of the multilingual learners in their classrooms. We found that teachers moved away from implementing sheltered instruction practices based on general principles or formal classifications, such as students' English language proficiency level, instead taking a more nuanced approach to adopting, adapting and rejecting practices based on perceived needs, assets, and personal knowledge about individual multilingual students in the specific disciplinary context of science. Based on this analysis, we conceptualize and refine what we now see as a new and exploratory set of Next Generation Sheltered Instruction practices for integrating science and language to support multilingual learners in secondary science classrooms in the age of the NGSS.

AB  - Secondary school educators are told to teach more mathematics and science to their students to help them become more proficient in the two subjects. Coordination of mathematics and science teaching is recognized as another means of improving proficiency. The National Science Foundation has funded the "Mathematics, Science and Technology Partnership" at Hofstra University and Stony Brook University to enhance mathematical proficiency of middle school students through coordinated teaching of mathematics, science, and technology. Involvement in this project has inspired the author to incorporate mathematical concepts in her own college classroom. In particular, she used mathematical concepts to enhance the teaching of a biological course in Molecular Immunology, the study of the immune system. This course is taught to undergraduates and to perspective biology teachers at Stony Brook University. Three areas in the course have become enriched through the introduction of mathematical concepts. These areas are also covered briefly in other biology courses such as Molecular and Cellular Biology, Microbiology, and in various laboratory courses at Stony Brook University. The incorporation of mathematical concepts in these three areas is described in this article. The author has found that using mathematical concepts to enhance the teaching of immunology has enriched students' grasp of the subject and makes teaching more rewarding.

AB  - Incorporating engineering instruction into the elementary curriculum is not without challenges. Traditionally, researchers investigated using engineering design to promote students learning science concepts. More recently, researchers have conducted qualitative investigations to measure students' learning of engineering concepts after engaging in engineering design. In this study, we extended work on elementary engineering instruction by implementing an integrated engineering and writing unit with 58 third-grade students. Using stratified random assignment based on pre-intervention engineering vocabulary assessment scores, we assigned students to treatment (n = 28) or comparison (n = 30). During a 10-day unit, all students participated in design challenges, emulated the practices of actual engineers, and used writing to support and document their learning, as they designed and authored their own five-page pop-up books. Students in the treatment condition participated in additional writing during 8 of the 10 unit lessons. During this time, they responded to journal prompts related to lesson objectives. At the same time, students in the comparison condition participated in small-group discussions during which they discussed journal prompts orally. We found that all students made statistically significant gains from pre- to posttest on an engineering vocabulary assessment; total words written, number of different engineering concepts used, and depth of understanding of engineering concepts in a written essay response; and number of different engineering concepts used in an oral interview response, regardless of their incoming writing skills and regardless of whether they participated in additional writing or small-group discussion of lesson objectives. This study is the first to quantitatively document the effectiveness of a combined elementary engineering and writing intervention for promoting students' learning of engineering concepts in multiple ways (rote recall, written representation, and oral representation). We argue that literacy, particularly writing, provides an effective and feasible method for incorporating engineering instruction into the elementary curriculum.

AB  - For graduation, high school students with learning disabilities and other high-incidence disabilities need sufficient science credits. For many students, their success is dependent on how well they learn in co-taught classes. However, students seldom have a voice about co-teaching in science. In this study, high school students with and without learning disabilities and other high-incidence disabilities provided their perspectives about co-taught science classes. Disproportionate stratified random sampling was used to select students from 17 co-taught science classes. Ninety-nine students completed the Co-Teaching Student Questionnaire (CTSQ) about science co-teachers' roles and level of agreement with statements about co-taught instruction. Additionally, students' written responses about co-teaching benefits and suggestions for improvement were analyzed. Results indicated similarities and differences in perceptions from students with and without disabilities. More than half of all students accessed both co-teachers when they needed help, and almost all students agreed the teachers seemed comfortable sharing responsibilities when co-teaching. Students were divided about whether co-teachers distributed tasks evenly. A benefit noted in qualitative themes was having support and help from co-teachers, whereas an improvement was ensuring special educators had sufficient science content knowledge. Implications for practice and future research, including eliciting and using students' perspectives, are presented.

AB  - An Introductory Information System (IIS) course is an opportunity for Information System (IS) programs to clarify business students' understandings of IS disciplines and help them prepare for careers requiring IS skills. The course is also essential to attract students into the IS major and mitigate declines in IS enrollment. This paper provides a roadmap and description of implementing an IIS course as part of the business core curriculum at a public university in the Midwestern United States. The roadmap is rooted in both generalizable and institution-specific contexts and includes the identification of key stakeholders, institutional challenges, and nine course design principles. The core principles are outlined and recognized as the foundation of the success of the course. Following course implementation, we present the evaluation of the success of our roadmap and reflect on lessons learned in the process.

AB  - Slideware applications (e.g., PowerPoint) have become more prevalent in instruction across disciplines. This is especially true at post secondary institutions where many instructors are using slideware as a sole instructional tool. This study evaluated the relative effectiveness of scientific visualization in two PowerPoint delivery strategies on science learning for preservice teachers. Twenty-five preservice teachers enrolled in an undergraduate introduction to science education class were stratified into two PowerPoint delivery strategies. The strategies were: PowerPoint with instructor voiceover narration and PowerPoint without voiceover. Post-test Mann-Whitney U suggested no differences (p greater than 0.05) in science learning across the two strategies. Further, eye tracking analysis suggests voiceover guides the PowerPoint user to graphics and text, but voiceover does not significantly affect learning. Results suggest immediacy with technology doesn't necessarily produce meaningful learning. Good teaching still is the key component of meaningful learning.

AB  - Introductory undergraduate science courses are traditionally offered as distinct units without formalized student interaction between classes. To bridge science courses, the authors used three Honors Organic Chemistry projects paired with other science courses. The honors students delivered presentations to mainstream organic course students and in the general chemistry laboratory course, and collaborations with computer science course students produced animations of organic reactions. Honors students were prepared for project work through weekly assignments designed to teach navigation and use of primary scientific literature.

AB  - Education for sustainability -- understood as efforts to equip people with the knowledge and skills necessary to make environmental, social and economic decisions that consider the needs of present and future generations -- has been incorporated in the official curriculum of Australia as a 'cross-curriculum priority'. This research sought to understand practising primary school teachers' integration of the sustainability cross-curriculum priority into the curriculum. In this study, nine primary school teachers in the Perth metropolitan region (five generalist; four specialists -- including two science specialists) were interviewed about the extent to which the Western Australian Curriculum has guided and supported their teaching practices in relation to sustainability and the sustainability cross-curriculum priority. Through detailed and rich examples of classroom practice, the participants illustrated the web of interrelated factors that characterise the implementation of the sustainability cross-curriculum priority across various learning areas, including science. Participant experiences also alluded to the idea that the sustainability cross-curriculum priority is a valuable avenue for re-emphasising science concepts across learning areas. Overall, the most salient take-home message of this work is that, in addition to the various influences contributing to the implementation of the sustainability cross-curriculum priority (such as whether a school is considered sustainably built), teachers are the main actors in the implementation of sustainability and making informed decisions about how sustainability is to be incorporated in their teaching. However, in order for teachers to drive this implementation, their required level of support goes beyond the curriculum and includes active engagement from their school leadership teams.

AB  - Plants are crucial parts of ecosystems but are traditionally considered boring and difficult by students. It is therefore not clear whether factual knowledge about plants contributes to building positive attitudes and interest in botany. We investigated whether factual knowledge about monocotyledonous plants is associated with secondary students' attitudes toward and interest in plants. Furthermore, we examined whether self-reported plant cultivation experiences and gender differences exist in attitudes toward plants. Factual knowledge about monocotyledonous plants significantly correlated with attitudes toward plants and these attitudes were greatly influenced by interest in botany, ecology, evolution, and zoology, but not with other, more distant biological disciplines (e.g. microbiology, or health and nutrition). Females received better scores in knowledge and attitudes toward plants, but interest in plants was similar between males and females. We suggest that (1) factual knowledge in botany is essential in building positive attitudes toward plants and that (2) inter-connections between botany with zoology, ecology and evolution may help with elimination of plant blindness and building positive attitudes toward plants.

AB  - Similar in scope and intent to the National Science Education Standards, the Standards for Technological Literacy were conceptualized as a way to bring more consistency and accountability to the varied technology education K-12 content in the United States (International Technology Education Association, 2000). The organization's goal was to continue the reform of technology education from its industrial arts past to an interdisciplinary and academic future, thus ensuring continued support from educational and political leaders. The future of technology education is uncertain. Technology is changing so rapidly that it is difficult for schools to keep up-to-date technologies in the classrooms (Dugger & Naik, 2001). States are using strong local programs to build a case for technology education as a basic core requirement for graduation (Newberry, 2001). These challenges persuaded leaders of the Technology for All Americans Project and the International Technology Education Association to follow the direction of leaders in science and mathematics in developing standards for the field of technology education. The central problem this paper examines is how content standards devised at the national level filter down into classrooms where teachers make the decision to implement or not. A critical element in dissemination of "top-down" standards is the role of district content area supervisors. There is a paucity of research that explores district-level factors that contribute to or hinder facilitation of education reform. Educational leaders have a lack of understanding about how attributes of the supervisors and districts themselves affect implementation of content standards in classrooms. Two potential results from the study are more efficient ways of disseminating educational innovations in the future and identification of districts that will require more concerted training in the standards. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between school district and technology education district-level supervisor variables and the technology education teachers' perceived levels of classroom implementation of the Standards for Technological Literacy in their respective districts.

AB  - In this conceptual paper, I put forward an argument about the conceptualization of science identity as a landscape of becoming by placing emphasis on "recognition" and "emotions," as core features of identity, through an intersectionality lens. These constructs intertwined, I argue, can give meaning to the process of becoming a science person or forming a science identity, and at the same time shed light on issues related to power, inequality, racism, and exclusion. In the context of these bigger issues, I argue that forming a science identity is not only personal, but also political. The need for intersectionality as a conceptual framework for studying science identity is underscored by the dearth of theory and empirical evidence that addresses classroom inequalities, as well as the multiple and interlocking influence of systems of privilege and oppression in science, such as racism and sexism. Recognition, which refers to how individuals are recognized by others as certain kinds of people, is an ineradicable part of our social world; it is bound within sociopolitical contexts and tied to specific cultural norms, values, beliefs, and stereotypes. Hence, recognition becomes of paramount importance in science identity research. However, critical questions still remain unanswered, such as who is allowed in the world of science and who is recognized as a science person in specific contexts? Directly linked to recognition, I argue, are different types of emotions which can offer a valuable lens for studying inequalities within the process of forming a science identity. What this means for science identity research is how important it is to explore the emotionality of science identity given that emotions are not just dialectically related but inextricably bound with (mis)recognition as well as with various systems of oppression.

AB  - This article focuses on the need for universities as teaching and research organisations, to recognise and act upon a more culturally inclusive interpretation of "sustainable development" and "sustainability". It argues for the valuing of indigenous worldviews as a means of achieving a more holistic and interdisciplinary way of thinking about the Earth as the home of all people and as a complement to the beliefs of western science and rational objective thinking. At a more personal level, it challenges readers, especially academics, to re-examine their own ways of thinking and knowing for the sake of creating sustainable futures that are inclusive in its processes, contexts and outcomes.

AB  - Integrated STEM learning is an appropriate approach to improve students' abilities and skills needed in the 21st century. Therefore, this literature study aims to discuss the effectiveness of integrated STEM implementation in science learning. The focus of this research includes integrated STEM implementation, effectiveness, and analysis of abilities and skills that can be improved through STEM integration. The method used in this literature study is a Systematic Literature Review, which includes several stages, namely Identification, Screening, and Included. The databases used include Springer, Taylor & Francis, ERIC, and Google Scholar. This literature review article is limited to the last 8 years, from 2016 to 2023. After screening, 35 articles were obtained, which were used as literature material regarding the effectiveness of integrated STEM learning in science. The results of the study show that STEM implementation can be integrated with various learning models such as PjBL, PBL, Jigsaw, 5E-EDP, and 6E-Cycle. In addition, it can also be integrated with media, including interactive video, virtual labs, and mobile augmented reality. Integrated STEM has proven to be effective in improving students' abilities and skills. The student's abilities and skills include 4C skills, concept understanding and cognitive abilities, motivation, ICT and computational literacy, spatial and geographic thinking skills, and mathematical thinking skills.

AB  - Given the growing evidence of academic language demands embodied in science practices, this study aimed to design and evaluate the effectiveness of a literacy-science integrated program that emphasized the incorporation of academic vocabulary instruction and collaborative discussion of a socio-scientific issue in sixth-grade science classrooms in an urban school. The treatment students (n = 73) who participated in the intervention had significantly higher academic vocabulary knowledge and scientific argumentation posttest scores than the control students (n = 62). The effect on academic vocabulary knowledge was particularly greater for bilingual students than their monolingual peers. Mediation analyses revealed that the intervention effects on science content knowledge and scientific argumentation were mediated by academic vocabulary knowledge. Findings indicate that science teachers' instructional scaffolding for academic vocabulary and authentic discourse can not only improve students' academic vocabulary knowledge but also indirectly affect science content knowledge and scientific argumentation via academic vocabulary knowledge.

AB  - In writing science summaries, student writers frequently borrow language fragments from source texts. While taking a text's ideas verbatim is commonly considered a failure in writers' expected use of their own words or even plagiarism, imitating "linguistic chunks" from skilled speakers is also an effective practice in language development. This study argues for the need to investigate textual borrowing (TB) from a developmental perspective. A total of 956 U.S. upper-elementary and middle school L1 students were administered a reading comprehension test, a written summary task, and a receptive academic language assessment. Multiple indices were generated to capture TB frequency, length, and one particular function of TB (i.e., definitions). Results revealed that 68% of summaries contained at least one incidence of TB. As expected, both TB frequency and length were negatively associated with reading comprehension and academic language skills. However, students in higher grades demonstrated significantly more and longer TB in comparison to their younger counterparts when summarizing the same passage. In addition, the frequency of borrowed word strings and the ratio of definitional borrowing were positively associated with summary writing quality, and the latter association was found to be stronger for students with higher academic language skills. Implications for pedagogy and future research are discussed. [For the corresponding grantee submission, see ED614239.]

AB  - Educational practice today encourages interdisciplinary teaching as teachers address important basic themes from a variety of angles. In this article, the author talks about one of her successful projects that focuses on "sense of place" as one such theme, with the more specific charge of viewing Earth from both scientific and artistic perspectives. The project combines satellite imagery and the technique of silk painting in batik, which allows students to record their geospatial understanding in a visual way. Here, she explains how geospatial technology can help students visually investigate Earth's surface and how art can become a vital aid in that understanding. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - An academic career at a community college is in a number of ways quite different from a career at a four-year university. From the emphasis on teaching and pedagogy to the absence of the "publish or perish" imperative (at least in most parts of the country), community college professors often navigate an array of challenges different from those navigated by university professors. Indeed, this is certainly the case with political scientists at community colleges. In this article, I address two important issues that are common in academic life at the two-year institution: (1) the role of contingency faculty and the transition from that to full-time/tenured status and (2) the importance of teaching across the subfields in political science at the two-year level.

AB  - Calculus is typically one of the first college courses encountered by science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors. Calculus often presents major challenges affecting STEM student persistence, particularly for students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM. For life sciences majors, calculus courses may not offer content that is relevant to biological systems or connect with students' interests in biology. We developed a transformative approach to teaching college-level math, using a dynamical systems perspective that focuses first on demonstrating why students need math to understand living systems, followed by providing quantitative and computational skills, including concepts from calculus, that students need to build and analyze mathematical models representing these systems. We found that students who complete these new math courses perform better in subsequent science courses than their counterparts who take traditional calculus courses. We also provide evidence that the new math curriculum positively impacts students' academic performance, with data that show narrowing of the achievement gap, based on students' math grades, between student subgroups in the new math courses. Moreover, our results indicate that students' interest in the concepts and skills critical to the quantitative preparation of 21st-century life sciences majors increases after completing the new contextualized math curriculum.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is being recognized as a critical component of student success in the digital era. Many contend that integrating CT into core curricula is the surest method for providing all students with access to CT. However, the CT community lacks an agreed-upon conceptualization of CT that would facilitate this integration, and little effort has been made to critically analyze and synthesize research on CT/content integration (CTCI). Conflicting CT conceptualizations and little understanding of evidence-based strategies for CTCI could result in significant barriers to increasing students' access to CT. To address these concerns, we analyzed 80 studies on CT education, focusing on both the CT conceptualizations guiding current CT education research and evidence-based strategies for CTCI. Our review highlights the code-centric nature of CT education and reveals significant gaps in our understanding of CTCI and CT professional development for teachers. Based on these findings, we propose an approach to operationalizing CT that promotes students' participation in CT, present promising methods for infusing content with CT, and discuss future directions for CT education research.

AB  - Over the last three decades many universities have offered various programmes related to Information Systems. However, the rapid changes in recent years demand constant evaluation and modification of education programmes. Recent challenges include, for instance, the move towards programmes that are more applied and professionally-orientated. The Bologna Declaration in Europe with its three level study structure as well as the increasing pressure to ensure funding within most departments adds further pressure to many universities. Despite attempts being made to provide reference to curricula and guidelines, many universities and faculties struggle with the proper direction and design of the information systems curricula. Common reference curricula related to information systems are, for example: the IS 2002; Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in information systems; the MSIS 2000: Model Curriculum and Guidelines for Graduate Degree Programs in Information Systems. Although these guidelines have existed for many years, many discussions and disagreements exist on the content and direction of information systems curricula and information systems as a discipline. Recently a joint task force of the Association for Computing Machinery and Association of Information Systems is aiming at revising the IS 2002 undergraduate curriculum (Topi et al., 2007). At the same time we are experiencing decreasing enrolments in information system programmes worldwide (Granger, Dick, Luftman, Slyke, & Watson, 2007). This article views information systems study programmes from an engineering perspective and presents a framework for structuring information systems programmes within Europe. We amalgamated the IS 2002 and MSIS 2000 model curriculum with a recommendation for studying business informatics, published from the German Society for Informatics (Gesellschaft fur Informatik, 2003). The framework was used to identify differences between selected study programmes currently in place for information systems curricula. For the study we selected two historically different educational systems: the United Kingdom and Ireland as representative for the Anglophone area and Germany, Austria, and Switzerland as representative of a continental European approach. We collected data from 20 Universities and classified the studied subject areas along our framework. Our results show that even in the context of the Bologna Declaration and common credit transfer systems, the study programmes nationally and internationally remain very diverse. Indeed, this makes comparisons between study programmes difficult to ascertain. The analysis reveals indications that the controversy in information systems is often due to two related but fundamentally diverse streams, one being a technology and engineering-orientated focus and the other being a business- and management-orientated emphasis. The relatively strong inclusion of engineering principles appears to be typical for business informatics degrees, emphasizing both mathematics and structural science. Logistics, accounting, and economics are specific courses which are common to most business informatics curricula. The study led to the development and accreditation of a business informatics study programme at Dublin City University. In this article we summarize the curriculum and present experiences made during the accreditation process. Indeed the accreditation process confirmed our earlier result , that information systems have two fundamentally different streams: technology and managerial orientation. This programme was introduced in September 2006, with a relative low number of students enrolling in the programme, and we report on experiences made during the last two years of running the programme. Graduates from this programme were all recruited into related employment. Furthermore, practitioners confirmed the career relevant curriculum. Due to this success, we expect increased attractiveness of the programme. However, the lack of adequate funding to market and promote the degree could impact on the enrollment numbers of the degree. The final curriculum comprises a balanced and interdisciplinary structure that centers on engineering principles and focuses on transformation, models and methods. The engineering emphasis throughout the programme is seen as one important characteristic. This differentiates the proposed programme from other management oriented information systems degrees. Therefore the business informatics approach appears to us to be innovative with regard to its interdisciplinary character. Furthermore the engineering perspective and the integration of cultural studies and practical experiences in an international setting equip graduates with unique and career oriented capabilities. The paper concludes that business informatics is not just a new term, but instead offers an engineering oriented stream on information systems. As such, business informatics can complement the traditional managerial oriented study programmes. (Contains 3 tables.

AB  - Integrating computational thinking (CT) into STEM disciplines requires secondary teachers to develop their pedagogical content knowledge of computing and content integration. Experienced teachers who choose to integrate CT in their secondary STEM courses may struggle in the same ways as novice teachers as they learn about programming and its potential use within their content areas. This study describes these potential struggles as teacher re-novicing in the context of high school physics. The research team facilitated a week-long computing integration workshop for physics teachers (n = 24) from three countries. The teachers engaged with computational learning activities in Jupyter Notebooks with the goal of developing their capacity to integrate Python in physics applications. Qualitative analysis of teacher surveys supported our theorization of a pathway of CT integration knowledge development. We describe these professional learning needs in four illustrative cases, building a grounded theory for teacher re-novicing as a pathway beginning with computing knowledge, moving through physics applications of computing, and arriving at pedagogical knowledge for physics-CT integration.

AB  - Learning communities gained attention in 1984 after the publication of the "Involvement in Learning" report, which was sponsored by the U.S. Education Department. The authors of the report stated that active engagement in learning processes enhances learning and leads to two fundamental principles: (1) The amount of student learning and personal development associated with any educational program is directly proportional to the quality and quantity of student involvement; and (2) The effectiveness of any educational policy or practice is directly related to the capacity of that policy or practice to increase student involvement in learning (NIE 1984). In order to address these limitations, a mobile learning environment (MLE) is being developed. This MLE will provide communication and collaboration tools that enable virtual interactions to take place which are independent of time and location--replacing the need for common residence halls and face-to- face meetings outside of the classroom. MLE makes it possible to create virtual learning communities (VLCs) that incorporate all of the positive aspects of traditional LCs, but without their time and space limitations. This article presents an MLE to support VLCs in science and mathematics in its early stages of a multidisciplinary research project.

AB  - International curricular redevelopment and quality improvement efforts include integration within and across disciplines as a focal point. Definitions and applications of the term 'integration' vary routinely in health professions education literature, weakening opportunities to enhance our educational practice through collaborative, interprofessional knowledge-sharing. This systematic review examined recent health professions education literature for reported definitions, theories or frameworks, and educational activities around integrated learning, education, curricula, or teaching. A total of 35 articles representing learners from 12 different health professions, between 2017 and 2021, were analyzed through a literature search of seven databases: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, JSTOR, the Cochrane Library, LGBTQ + Life, and ERIC. Full-text retrieval and data extraction of the included studies were conducted. Of the 35 articles reviewed, 13 included explicit definitions of integration (an additional six alluded to a definition), 19 referred to an educational theory or framework used to guide integration design efforts, and 27 mentioned teaching methods by which integration was implemented. Misunderstanding what is meant by integrated, how others have planned for it, or how others have sought to bring it about practically, all threaten attempts to improve the cultivation of health professionals as integrated thinkers and holistic care providers.

AB  - As science and technology create an ecosystem that is becoming increasingly more knowledge-intensive, complex, and interconnected, the next generation science standards include systems thinking and systems modeling among 21st skills that should be fostered. We examined the effect of an online cross-disciplinary learning process on the development of systems thinking and modeling skills among engineering students and engineering and science teachers. The study, which used quantitative and qualitative tools, included 55 participants who performed four food-related learning assignments and created conceptual models in Object-Process Methodology. Their responses to online assignments were analyzed along with their perceptions, captured via a reflection questionnaire. The online learning process in this study effectively enhanced systems thinking and modeling skills of all learners, including those with no relevant background. One main conclusion that extends beyond the online learning was that imparting the basics of systems thinking and conceptual modeling skills can be achieved even within a short period of time--less than one semester. The contribution of the study is the formation of theoretical and practical frameworks for the integration of an cross-disciplinary model-based systems engineering online assignments into engineering and science curricula.

AB  - The need for employees in the exact and natural sciences sector with both work experience and academic qualifications, especially combined with an entrepreneurial mindset, is rising. The University of Groningen offers an alternative Master's program entitled Science, Business and Policy (SBP). SBP combines entrepreneurship education with the integration of a disciplinary science domain and thereby prepares students in science advising. This includes a work placement of 6 months, provided by companies, policy organisations and NGOs. To examine the impact of work placements from the perspective of the employer, this article analyses 20 semi-structured interviews with providers of placements. The results show that employers judge students who have undertaken a work placement as attractive future employees, and the quality of science advice given by students is seen as high. From a work floor perspective, work placements are a strong component in the optimal education of future employees. Integrating academic theory and experience in practice contributes to the employability of science students. The impact of work placements goes further than employability, since employers also indicate a direct effect on work dynamics and see the direct impact of advice reports in their organisation. The work-based learning approach chosen to achieve this specific entrepreneurship education fits the need of industry and other non-academic employers.

AB  - Knowledge transfer refers to the (1) recognition of overlap in past learning and new academic goals, (2) recollection of previously learned information, and (3) application of past learning in a new context or discipline. Promoting effective transfer remains a notorious challenge for chemistry educators. To address this need, the step back, translate, and extend (SBTE) instructional framework was designed based on principles derived from cognitive psychology and social cognitive theory. A comprehensive description of the SBTE framework is presented here, alongside a qualitative analysis of student interviews, revealing the long-term impact of a transfer intervention (OrgoPrep) designed using the SBTE framework. This six week summer preparatory program facilitating the transition from general chemistry was previously found to improve course grades in organic chemistry. The present study further elucidates the mechanisms through which the SBTE framework undergirding OrgoPrep strengthened transfer. Specifically, improvements in students' application skills were the most prominent, regardless of prior success in general chemistry. Of note, the SBTE framework also altered student learning approaches to prioritize more problem-solving, presumably inducing the long-lasting benefits of the intervention. Another key feature of the SBTE framework is its emphasis on incorporating instructional techniques for raising self-efficacy. Student feedback confirmed the impacts of the SBTE framework on several contributors to self-efficacy: mastery experiences (i.e., offering opportunities for successful problem-solving), vicarious experiences (i.e., offering opportunities for observing peers and instructors engage in successful problem-solving), and physiological and emotional states (i.e., creating a low-stress learning environment). Although the program assessed in this study focused on the transition from general chemistry to organic chemistry, the SBTE framework is well-poised to serve as a blueprint for designing knowledge transfer interventions across many disciplines.

AB  - The digital humanities (DH) is an emerging field of teaching and research that invites modern technologies to address traditional humanities questions while simultaneously making space for humanistic critiques of those technologies. A natural relationship exists between DH and the field of information studies (the iField), particularly surrounding their common focus on the interface between humans and computers, as well as subfields such as the organization of information, libraries and archives, data preservation, and information in society. Thus, we propose that iField programs in universities should take an active role in DH education. We are particularly interested in programs that are officially Information Schools (iSchools), members of the international iSchools Organization. Our research began as part of a DH curriculum committee convened by the iSchools Organization. To support iSchool engagement in DH education, we have inventoried and analyzed the degrees and supplemental credentials offered by DH education programs throughout the world. Our study deployed multiple data collection methods, which included conducting both ad hoc and comprehensive website surveys, querying an online DH catalog, and inviting members of the iSchools Organization to participate in an online questionnaire. This work has revealed several common patterns for the current structure of DH programs, including the various types of degrees or supplemental credentials offered. We observe that iSchools have a significant opportunity to become more engaged in DH education and we suggest several possible approaches based on our research.

AB  - Increasingly recognized as having significant economic and ecological impacts, non-native invasive species have become an important interdisciplinary topic in biological and social science courses. Oceanic island systems like Hawaii have been particularly susceptible to invaders and efforts to prevent further invasions focus on reducing the accidental and purposeful pathways by which harmful species arrive. A proposal that was initiated in 1988 to expand the airport at Kahului to allow direct international flights to Maui was embraced by some residents as a much-needed plan for expanding tourism and providing long-term economic improvements. Others predicted that if flights arrived from a variety of Pacific Rim countries, invasive species would be introduced that could find a suitable new home somewhere in Maui's diverse habitats. Such invaders would likely include new agricultural pests and threats to natural resource conservation, especially to the many endemic species in Haleakala National Park, and hence could have negative long-term impacts on the ecology and quality of life on Maui. We have developed materials based on this on-going, real-world scenario so that students can develop their research, communication, and critical thinking skills through examination of these conflicting ecological and social issues. Used either as a classroom role-playing exercise or as a case study for students working independently, participants will integrate information from biological, geographical, social, and political science  disciplines, while learning how local business and conservation interests can influence, and be influenced by, changes in global trade and transportation.

AB  - This research used mixed effects to construct a PBL-STEM (problem-based learning with STEM) questionnaire with high validity and reliability. The benefits of PBL-STEM focused on cross-disciplinary and longitudinal research to analyze students' self-efficacy in life science. All 175 university students who attended this course as an elective participated in this research. The purpose was to evaluate students' performance in the cake-baking practice experiential course and to use unpaired samples t-test, one-way ANOVA, and feedback analysis as quantitative and qualitative data. The following are noteworthy results: The t-test showed that five stimulated scales were significantly different and better after the cake-baking PBL-STEM activity. In one-way ANOVA, to engage with more students in STEM activities, improve conceptual learning, and close achievement gaps. The more enthusiastic students are, the more actively they study and think, and the more effectively they improve their PBL-STEM learning. Students' feedback analysis of this teaching activity is beneficial for improving technology, student-teacher engagement, process comprehension, and learning interest. The light of this research will foster a disposition of learning, enhance cake-baking skills, and encourage problem-solving based on their thinking.

AB  - Environmental education (EE) in elementary schools (6 - 15 years old) in Slovakia is not systematically defined, it is often dependent on the voluntary efforts and enthusiasm of teachers. Schoolchildren acquire environmental knowledge in a limited form during the teaching of individual subjects, especially Biology, Geography and to some extent, also Chemistry, Physics etc. In elementary schools, the school subject of EE is absent. Therefore, the aim of the presented study is to find out the current situation in formal and informal EE at elementary schools in Slovakia. We gathered data on formal EE in the form of a google questionnaire survey, in which only 18% of all elementary schools in Slovakia were willing to participate. Through some questions in the google questionnaire, these elementary schools also provided informations about the inclusion of formal, informal and non-formal education at elementary schools. Our SWOT analysis indicate a need for systematic EE in elementary schools, as well as improvements of teaching materials and teacher training in this area. At the same time, we present the EE model at the Rakovec nad Ondavou Elementary School with Kindergarten, which is included in the Green School Network and actively involved in Erasmus projects providing the opportunity to implement part of the study and internships abroad.

AB  - Biomimicry, the process of using nature to guide innovative thinking and development, can be useful in helping students grasp scientific concepts. Teachers interested in incorporating biomimicry into lesson plans might find that experiential learning at informal science institutions (ISIs) with natural models and artifacts is a valuable tool to accompany classroom learning. Visiting these ISIs, students have the opportunity to observe nature in real time and be immersed in inspiration. As students explore these natural models in habitats and exhibits, educators might ask students to consider the interesting features they observe and to creatively consider innovative designs that these features could inspire. For example, an elephant's trunk might inspire a robotic arm. These direct experiences at ISIs might draw upon students' innate biophilia to learn more about living organisms and lead to increased creativity and design output. I developed this guide based on my experiences as an informal biomimicry educator and my 2017 keynote address presented at the Annual Docent Conference at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo.

AB  - Professional development programs might affect teachers' perceptions of how STEM disciplines are interconnected. The purpose of this research was to examine the change in perceptions of science teachers particularly in disadvantageous schools, who participated in a practice-based professional development program offered in Turkey, about STEM, entrepreneurship, and E-STEM, and their experiences related to E-STEM. This qualitative research had a phenomenological design. The participants were totally 30 science teachers who were teaching in each of the seven geographical regions of Turkey. The data were collected through semi-structured pre- and post-focus group interview forms finalized after the expert review and pilot study. Furthermore, the science teachers were asked to keep a diary about the implementation process throughout the research. The data collected through focus group interviews were examined using content analysis and the data collected through the diaries were examined using descriptive analysis. The findings of the study indicate that the science teachers defined E-STEM as a process containing the aspects of entrepreneurship (communication, perseverance and determination, self-confidence, motivation, risk-taking, presentation, and marketing) more comprehensively compared to the pre-interviews.

AB  - Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) has been widely used in both industry and in schools over at least the last twenty years. The Industry Hothousing variant of CPS is an intensive, time-constrained workshop-based process to build mutual trust between customers and industry experts in order to synergically develop creative solutions. The main objective of this research is to determine whether and how Hothousing might be used in schools for developing Collaborative Problem Solving and then promoting industry skills. In particular, we seek to establish the degree of structure and support required to unleash student creativity and enhance learning, and the benefits to students and teachers in learning, cross-curricular applicability and time savings. Hothousing for students is based on an intensive series of workshops including face-to-face and on-line collaboration supported by a facilitator. It is student-driven and addresses an open-ended challenge such as: how do I get my friends to love STEAM? Three collaborative problem-solving case studies were examined with different groups of students. Concerning the degree of structure and support, the analyses revealed that student-led intensive collaboration within a trusted framework drives creativity, and it was a good opportunity to experience real life challenges. Positive benefits to students and teachers were the development of technology skills, and Personal Learning and Thinking Skills (PLTS) as well as the enhancement perception of self and STEAM education. These benefits were cross-curricular providing qualitative and efficiency gains including on-line learning.

AB  - For nearly four decades, researchers have explored the integration of arts and humanities content into health professions education (HPE). However, enduring controversies regarding the purpose, efficacy, and implementation of humanities initiatives suggest that the "timing" and "context" of trainees' exposure to such content is a key, but seldom considered, factor. To better understand the affordances of introducing humanities-based health curriculum prior to the HPE admissions gateway, we conducted a qualitative instrumental case study with participants from Canada's first Health Humanities baccalaureate program. Fully anonymized transcripts from semi-structured interviews (n = 11) and focus groups (n = 14) underwent an open-coding procedure for thematic narrative analysis to reveal three major temporal domains of described experience (i.e., "prior to," "during," and "following" their participation in a 12-week semester-long "Introduction to Health Humanities" course). Our findings demonstrate that perceptions of arts- and humanities content in health education are generated well in advance of HPE admission. Among other findings, we define a new concept--epistemological multicompetence--to describe participants' emergent capability to toggle between (and advocate for the role of) multiple disciplines, arts and humanities particularly, in health-related teaching and learning at the pre-professional level. Improved coordination of baccalaureate and HPE curricula may therefore enhance the development of capabilities associated with arts and humanities, including: epistemological multicompetence, aesthetic sensibility, and other sought-after qualities in HPE candidates. In conclusion, attending to the pre-professional admissions gateway presents a new, capabilities-driven approach to enhancing both the implementation and critical understanding of arts and humanities' purpose, role, and effects across the "life course" of health professions education.

AB  - Calls for reform in science education stress the need for inquiry-based, integrative methods that provide students with opportunities to solve authentic problems. Project INSITE, a four-year professional development effort in Indiana, was designed to help teachers integrate problem-centered science methods in their classrooms. This approach was characterized by use of a meaningful driving question anchored in a real-world context; student-conducted investigations that resulted in the creation of products; collaboration among students, teachers, and the community; and use of technology as a tool for gathering and sharing information. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the project suggest that it was generally successful in promoting positive teacher perceptions, fostering learner-centered classroom approaches, and leading to implementation of inquiry-based science in many classrooms.

AB  - Size and scale cognition is a critical ability associated with reasoning with concepts in different disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. As such, researchers and educators have identified the need for young learners and their educators to become scale-literate. Informed by developmental psychology literature and recent findings in nanoscale science and engineering education, we propose an integrated knowledge framework for characterizing and scaffolding size and scale cognition called the FS2C framework. Five ad hoc assessment tasks were designed informed by the FS2C framework with the goal of identifying participants' understandings of size and scale. Findings identified participants' difficulties to discern different sizes of microscale and nanoscale objects and a low level of sophistication on identifying scale worlds among participants. Results also identified that as bigger the difference between the sizes of the objects is, the more difficult was for participants to identify how many times an object is bigger or smaller than another one. Similarly, participants showed difficulties to estimate approximate sizes of sub-macroscopic objects as well as a difficulty for participants to estimate the size of very large objects. Participants' accurate location of objects on a logarithmic scale was also challenging. (Contains 8 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - We characterize the recently included programming content in Swedish mathematics textbooks for elementary school. Especially, the connection between programming content and traditional mathematical content has been considered. The analytical tools used are based on the so-called 5E's, a theoretical framework of action, developed within the ScratchMath project, and Brennan and Resnick's (2012) terms computational concepts and practices. The result uncovers "follow a procedure" as the dominating action, in which the concepts stepwise instruction and repeated pattern were frequent. Bridging between programming and mathematics is weak in the sense that the programming content does not enhance the possibility to explore mathematical concepts and ideas.

AB  - To address the problem of a serious Internet of Things (IoT) talent shortage, the Chinese government is encouraging universities and institutions to establish a major in IoT Engineering to train high-level IoT talent. Since 2011, 700 Chinese universities and institutions have established IoT Engineering undergraduate programs. We surveyed the history, status, curriculum, and problems of IoT undergraduate degree programs in China. Based on data collected from faculties, students, and graduates, we found that the IoT Engineering curriculum was an unsystematic patchwork and was deficient in practical platforms. We then provide suggestions for further development and exploration of IoT education by presenting a Technical Knowledge Map of IoT Engineering. This survey work on Chinese IoT education can prompt Chinese educators to reflect on its achievements and problems, which will contribute to IoT talent cultivation worldwide.

Novel interventions, especially within the K-12 space, call for a move from content acquisition to the formation of individuals' identity that particularly fosters science and math interest and persistence. Identity research has evidenced results, yet greater communication is needed between the research and practitioner communities to realize the potential of cultivating collective science and mathematics identities in the classroom. In this paper, we bridge these spaces by describing the potential student affordances beyond individual identity formation to that of collective (classroom-level) identity formation considerations by K-12 teachers' within mathematics and science. Specifically, we explore how traditional K-12 classroom structures may reinforce stereotypes and hinder collective mathematics and science identity formation, whereas reform-oriented classroom structures that employ legitimate peripheral participation within a community of practice enable them. Last, we recommend pedagogical interventions to practitioners that promote collective student opportunities to co-construct skills specific to mathematics and science communities as a strategy to foster collective mathematics and science identities. Collective identity formation can provide K-12 classroom teachers pedagogical strategies for additional opportunities or enhanced experiences for students to co-construct and reinforce individual identities in math and science.

AB  - As computational methods are widely used in science disciplines, integrating computational thinking (CT) into classroom materials can create authentic science learning experiences for students. In this study, we classroom-tested a CT-integrated geoscience curriculum module designed for secondary students. The module consisted of three inquiry investigations that were age-appropriately translated from the computational practices of volcanologists who study tephra hazards and risks. We developed a domain-specific, block-code-based computational modeling environment where students carried out 1 of the 3 science practices in each inquiry investigation: experimentation, data visualization and interpretation, and modeling. We examined (1) student learning outcomes using pre- and post-tests and (2) student reflections on the computationally supported science practices surveyed at the end of each inquiry investigation during the module. Results indicate that students made statistically significant gains in science content as well as in computationally supported experimentation, data visualization and interpretation, and modeling practices. Over 80% of students identified different ways in which block coding supported their practices during inquiry investigations. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for the future development of computationally supported inquiry investigations in science.

AB  - With the present forum contribution, I respond to the paper "Discerning contextual complexities in STEM career pathways--Insights from successful Latinas" by Alejandro Gallard Martínez, Wesley Pitts, Silvia Lizette Ramos de Robles, Katie L. Milton Brkich, Belinda Flores Bustos, and Lorena Claeys. I aim to augment the thoughts of Gallard Martínez et al. with a meta-analysis of the specific methodological approach. I point out the function and, likewise, the importance of metaphors for modelling and theoretically conceptualizing research. I argue, that metaphors have a clarifying function in accentuating the focus and perspective of research, which, in consequence, influences the theoretical modelling, and, in particular, the choice of research methods and the data interpretation. I focus on the three concept domains, PIPELINE, PATHWAY and INTERSECTION, as each concept provides knowledge structure, which, in current research, is projected on STEM careers of women. Further, I elaborate limitations of the leaky pipeline metaphor, as it does not provide adequate structural similarities to highlight the situated social, cultural, and historical dimensions of STEM, as well as their materialization in individual experiences and the positioning of human beings. I close my contribution by highlighting approaches of intersectional analysis in the field of STEM.

AB  - The paper describes an analysis of the questions posed by high school students regarding relationships between science and religion in a series of debates with scientists in public high schools of the northern part of Portugal. The exploratory interpretation of 171 collected anonymous written questions allowed for the detection of fragilities in the students' ideas about the nature of science and the nature of religion, connected with a trend to reject religion using scientism arguments. The findings reinforce a need of revising the fragmented teaching of nature of science and its connections with religion towards a more contextualized approach of diversified episodes of these social endeavours, anchored in life's 'big questions' that allow students to make cross-disciplinary connections. Our analysis also supports the need for more research on students' questions rather than on students' "answers" in more common research methodologies conducted to inform the development of a more meaningful curriculum.

AB  - From literature, we know that making the connections between mathematics and physics is not trivial for most students, even at the advanced level. In the specific context of partial derivatives in thermodynamics, research suggests that making explicit connections between the mathematics and the physics is necessary to foster student understanding. In this paper, we investigate how graphical reasoning can help undergraduate students in making connections between the partial derivatives of temperature with respect to position and to time and their respective physical meaning in the context of one-dimensional systems modeled by the heat equation. We conducted task-based, think aloud interviews with four pairs of undergraduate students majoring in physics or mathematics and use dynamic conceptual blending diagrams to analyze their reasoning processes and the role of the graphs therein. The results in this paper indicate that stimulating graphical reasoning is a promising way to promote the blending of mathematical and physical knowledge. Specifically, our data shows that constructing graphs can be a catalyst which helps students to give physical meaning to the partial derivatives ?T/?t and/or ?T/?x. Therefore, in teaching/learning activities, actively promoting graph construction and reasoning based on those graphs offers perspectives to support the blending of mathematics and physics.

AB  - The need to develop clean-energy storage systems, harvesting technologies, and new functional materials are but a few of the many contemporary challenges in the domain of science today. To address these challenges, problem solving has become a key skill of the 21st century. It is generally documented, however, that experts and students differ in terms of their problem-solving skills. Experts in a domain are fluent in the use of different resources to solve domain-specific problems, whereas students stumble when using formulas, devices, or measurement methods. In most cases, the students are not aware if and why the resources are appropriate to solve the given problem. To acquire expertise in a domain, it is necessary to become fluent in the domain-specific resources. This means being aware of various resources and how they can be used reflectively in problem solving. In this study, we investigated how students' awareness of various domain-specific resources developed within minimally guided, authentic research projects in an undergraduate materials chemistry course that focuses on crystal structures and its characterisation. By monitoring participants' problem solving through audio-diaries and in-depth qualitative interview data, we examined to what extent their awareness of domain-specific resources developed. We further characterised productive moments of failure and uncertainty during students' problem-solving processes that influenced their awareness. Thick descriptions of these moments facilitate understanding of how students' awareness develops in a minimally guided, authentic learning environment and how students can become fluent in a given domain.

AB  - When contextualizing educational methods, teachers can focus on constructivism to develop inquiry materials as STEAM subject matter for use in schools. However, there is little research concerning what STEAM teaching resources teachers view as inquiry with hands-on STEAM instructional material for use in kindergartens. Therefore, this research used a spiral developmental course design with action research to apply a teaching inquiry and hands-on STEAM model focusing on lesson development for kindergarten children via a one-year workshop. The lesson development process of this research included a total of six stages, allowing 24 participating teachers to analyse the STEAM elements from their original lesson plans, then make revisions according to a model, including: prediction, do/observation, quiz/discussion, and explanation/ transfer (PD/OQ/DE/T). After the initial lesson plan was completed, teaching experiments were conducted, and the lesson plan was adjusted through reflection and revisions based on the suggestions of domain experts during the implementation process. Finally, 48 PDOQDET inquiry and hands-on based STEAM lesson plans were developed. Thus, it is proposed that the inquiry and hands-on i-STEAM modules developed using the PDOQDET approach can represent exemplars illustrative of an enriched design constructivist paradigm to support students' i-STEAM learning in kindergartens.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this country report is to offer an overview of civic and citizenship education in Spain. Approach: The report analyses the Spanish curriculum and the current legislative framework, examining the way social and civic competences are integrated in both primary and secondary education. Additionally, the paper also examines the latest educational reform, establishing a comparison between how citizenship education was addressed in the curriculum until 2013 and the way a cross-curricular approach has been adopted since then. Findings: The paper has been able to establish a clear difference between two political and educational conceptions. On one hand, from 2006 to 2013, the Spanish government introduced "Citizenship and Human Rights Education" as a core subject linked to a broader approach to traditional civic education. After the 2013 reform, the new government favoured instead a cross-curricular orientation that avoided references to the idea of citizenship and limited the scope of civic education. A discussion is provided regarding what policy reforms can be expected in the near future in Spain.

AB  - In this article, the authors present a case study of preservice teachers engaged in service-learning in an after-school program while concurrently enrolled in science and language arts methods courses. Two interdisciplinary education faculty worked collaboratively to connect language arts and science methods content with service-learning experiences. Preservice teachers provided a service to elementary school students by developing and teaching integrated, inquiry-based lessons. The after-school program provided a service to preservice teachers by providing opportunities for them to interact with young children and teach integrated science and language arts lessons outside the constraints of a formal classroom setting. The preservice teachers' experience was considered "integrated" in this study because they were required to integrate language arts skills within every science lesson that they taught in the after-school program.

AB  - This study examines the use of narrative and paradigmatic modes of explanation in large group discussions about science in preschool classrooms. Participants comprised students and teachers in 29 preschool classrooms, 19 of which used the ScienceStart! curriculum, a hands-on, inquiry approach to teaching science with young children. Analyses of videotaped large group activities address two major research questions: (a) Does the use of a structured preschool science curriculum promote the use of paradigmatic explanations around science topics?, and (b) Where the narrative and paradigmatic modes are present, how are students socialized to understand and appropriately use these modes in science discourse? Results indicate that students in the science curriculum classrooms were exposed to a higher frequency of paradigmatic explanations than those in the comparison group. Children in this group also produced a higher relative frequency of paradigmatic explanations. Results of qualitative analysis reveal ways in which teachers socialized children to mix the narrative and paradigmatic modes, linking general principles with experienced events. Discussion of findings suggests that teaching scientific thinking with young children should involve a dialogue between abstract and experiential ways of thinking.

AB  - Purpose: This paper will examine the extent to which Economics education within the integrated Austrian subject of Geography and Economics delivered by teachers outside their own subject area differs from teaching delivered by those with a formal qualification in the subject. Design: Hypothesis testing was carried out using variance analyses, factor analyses and X[superscript 2] independence tests; qualitative content analysis was used to evaluate responses to the open questions of a questionnaire (Mayring 2000, Kuckartz 2012). Findings: The results show significant differences between the two teacher groups with regard to the popularity of Economics education, attitudes towards economics generally, and professional self-image. Limitations and implications: For resource reasons, the study had to be limited to Vienna. A further broader investigation seems necessary. Practical implications: In order to support teachers working outside their own subject area, two project networks have been launched which develop teaching materials for Socioeconomics education.

AB  - This paper investigates the perceptions of the heads of 12 Library and Information Science (LIS) schools on Knowledge Management (KM) education. These heads from North America, Europe and the Pacific region had either been offering KM courses or had an apparent interest in such programs. Data about perceptions were gathered on the nature of their KM coursework, KM positions their graduates might target, interdisciplinary partnerships, strategic partnerships with industry, and practical difficulties in the introduction of KM courses. They were asked to pinpoint difficulties in the areas of faculty availability, student enrollment, resource availability, creation of partnerships, working with professional associations, and interactions with industry. There existed a strong interest in offering KM courses, cultivating collaborations with business and computing schools, and developing strategic partnerships with industry. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Laboratory work in chemistry has been extensively researched in the last decade but the gap between research and practice is still broad. This "Perspective" shares 10 guiding principles relating to university laboratory education, drawing on research over the last decade. Written with an audience of practitioners in mind, the "Perspective" aligns with Hounsell and Hounsell's congruence framework, so that the 10 principles consider all aspects of the laboratory curriculum: design, teaching approaches, and assessment approaches as suggested by Biggs, but additional contextual factors relating to teaching context: backgrounds of students and their support, and overall laboratory organisation and management. After discussing the rationale for each guiding principle, examples of approaches are given from recent literature along with prompts to help enact the guiding principle in practice.

AB  - There are two main claims in this article. First, that the classic pillars of engineering education, namely, traditional mathematics and differential equations, are merely a particular, if not old-fashioned, representation of a broader mathematical vision, which spans from Turing machine programming and symbolic productions sets to sub-symbolic orderings such as artificial neural nets. Second, that the paradigm of equivalence ought to be extended to those non-traditional engineering disciplines that require at least the same dedication, such as music and its science, musicology, because they broaden the search and identification of structures, one of the most important tasks of creative engineering. Furthermore, an example of contemporary advanced technology will be given that favours these very claims. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - The use of innovative technologies in speech-language pathology is revolutionizing diagnostic and treatment approaches for individuals with communication disorders. This evolution has required educators to integrate the use of technologies into the clinical training pedagogy. Phonetic transcription is a foundational skill presented early in the undergraduate speech-pathology curriculum and serves as the basis for advanced course work in clinical diagnostic decision-making. Mastery requires regular practice and performance feedback. One factor that impedes the provision of more practice opportunities is the widely agreed-upon problem of grading phonetic transcription assignments by hand. The development of a computational tool that automatically grades transcription assignments served as the mechanism for an integrated learning opportunity between the departments of Communication Disorders and Computer Science and Software Engineering at Auburn University.

AB  - I argue that there is potential for collaborative work between science educators and citizenship educators. However, following comments about that potential, I raise a number of challenges. Those challenges relate to the public perception of science, narrow academic perspectives of some science educators, and problematic attempts to develop a form of science education that, at times, some have claimed is relevant to--or, even, a form of--citizenship education. The latter point is considered with reference to some science educators' perceptions concerning the nature of citizenship and citizenship education. I argue that the perceptions of some science educators seem to suggest significant differences in understanding from at least some of those who would regard themselves as citizenship education specialists. In the final main section of the article, I suggest, briefly, some ways in which further work to develop collaboration between science educators and citizenship educators could be considered.

AB  - This research aimed to investigate science learning in Tanfidz Boarding School. The focus of this research are: (1) Factors affecting students of a religious boarding school toward science learning, (2) Islamic boarding school students' perception and attitude toward science learning (value of science learning to religious boarding school students), (3) students' perception toward pleasant science learning. This was qualitative research. Method used in this research was phenomenology. Data collecting technique was an interview. Data analysis techniques applied were: collecting data, presenting data, and drawing conclusions. The results of this study were the school's vision and mission, parents, science teachers and religion teachers caused students to like or dislike science. Students assessed science as important because it was a provision to continue higher education, it was useful for carrying out daily activities, and it had historical considerations to restore the glory of Islam through science. Pleasant learning, creative packaging, being able to motivate, to connect science and religion, investigative activities, being humorous, being able to connect science with everyday life and to explain well were students' perceptions of a good teacher. The reasons students selected Tahfidz boarding school were the attitudes of science teachers, religion teachers, its school vision and mission, and attitudes of parents. Pleasant learning by a professional teacher was conducted by presenting creative learning, and having good emotional control. The implication of the results of this research is that the management of science learning in religious-based Islamic boarding schools needs to pay attention to the desires and needs of students in learning.

AB  - The study aimed to develop a cross-disciplinary integrative STEM (i-STEM) robotics curriculum by the thematic integration approaches of webbed and threaded models, and to understand high school students' cognitions, attitudes, and interests in robotics STEM after the instruction. The concurrent mixed methods including quantitative experimental design and embedded qualitative design were adopted in the present study. Participants were 42 students, with 17 females and 25 males in a high school class. The students were grouped with 2 members in each group, and there were totally 21 groups. The results revealed that cognition for seven fields were significantly improved. Among the seven fields, sailboat design improved the most, while mathematics and computer programming improved the least. The students' attitudes and interests in robotics STEM were significantly enhanced. The students' interests in engineering design were significantly enhanced the most, programming was the second; continuous study of engineering, science, or technology was the third; jobs related to engineering or programming was the fourth; and robotics was the least enhanced. Finally, the implications for teacher teaching and student learning practices were proposed.

AB  - A significant challenge to the community of chemistry education is the creation of materials that can be used in nonscience settings, including those of social science and humanities classrooms. As part of a larger effort to engage new communities in understanding how science data can impact such settings, including in the community, an experiment to detect the level of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the air was implemented in university sociology and history classrooms. The use of an authentic scientific method within these settings generated important data for classroom use in classroom sociological and historical discussions. The impact on student attitudes and learning was also determined.

AB  - Contribution: This paper quantifies the phenomenon of more versus better research output in computing research education and elaborates on how the organizational variable known as cognitive distance plays a fundamental role in mediating such more versus better research output relation. Background: To improve the current educational system, investigation and quantification is needed of the "silos." Cognitive distance--a measure of the differences in background, culture, and expertise between collaborators--may be a factor influencing the lack of quality and variety in research outputs. Addressing this is a key enabler for fruitful collaboration. Research Question: Does collaboration with similarly expert researchers yield better research? Methodology: A quantitative survey provides baseline data for cognitive distance while publication data allowed creation of a co-authorship network between 123 researchers in a European computing research department. The network was analyzed through quantitative and qualitative research methods. Findings: Increased expertise overlaps across sub-fields of computing is a strong predictor for further collaboration (quantity), but research impact (quality) decreases with larger overlaps. This reveals an educational silo effect in doctoral computing education and, consequently, a flaw in the connected research output. The lack of a single, agreed way to evaluate research impact across sub-fields further hinders cross-departmental collaboration among doctoral students. Conclusion: Three recommendations emerge for policy makers and educational leaders: 1) departments should be cross-functional and focused on societal interests; 2) communities of practice should be created at the level of doctoral education and upward; and 3) departments should hold matchmaking and speed-meeting events regularly within and across institutions.

AB  - Non-mathematics specialists' competence and confidence in mathematics in their disciplines have been highlighted as in need of improvement. We report from a collaborative, developmental research project which explores the conjecture that greater integration of mathematics and biology in biology study programs, for example through engaging students with Mathematical Modeling (MM) activities, is one way to achieve this improvement. We examine the evolution of 12 first-semester biology students' mathematical discourse as they engage with such activities in four sessions which ran concurrently with their mandatory mathematics course and were taught by a mathematician with extensive experience with MM. The sessions involved brief introductions to different aspects of MM, followed by small-group work on tasks set in biological contexts. Our analyses use the "theory of commognition" to investigate the tensions between "ritualized and exploratory participation" in the students' MM activity. We focus particularly on a quintessential "routine" in MM, "assumption building": we trace attempts which start from ritualized engagement in the shape of "guesswork" and evolve into more productively exploratory formulations. We also identify signs of persistent "commognitive conflict" in the students' activity, both "intra-mathematical" (concerning what is meant by a "math task") and "extra-mathematical" (concerning what constitutes a plausible solution to the tasks in a biological sense). Our analyses show evidence of the fluid interplay between ritualized and exploratory engagement in the students' discursive activity and contribute towards what we see as a much needed distancing from operationalization of the commognitive constructs of ritual and exploration as an unhelpfully dichotomous binary.

AB  - To address the lack of communication among scientists and teachers, the social media platform, Twitter, could be a useful tool. Over the years, Twitter has become an informal learning space for teachers (Rehm & Notten, 2016). Teachers use hashtags such as #scichat to collaborate with each other, share resources, stay informed about current educational practices, and hold conversations with people and organizations from around the world. Personal learning networks have emerged from these conversations. Twitter could be an excellent platform for science teachers to connect with scientists in order to assist them with their research via citizen science, but are they using it? In this investigation, the author explored the extent to which those involved in science teacher social networks are also involved in citizen science social networks. An overarching research question is "In what ways are K-12 science teachers involved in citizen science on Twitter?" The question was investigated with two sub-questions as follows: (1) What kind of overlaps exists between participants using science educator hashtags and citizen science hashtags?; and (2) What kind of overlaps exists between top influencers using science educator hashtags and citizen science hashtags? Findings from this study could assist researchers in determining the next steps for Twitter usage among science teachers who are interested in collaborating with scientists and pursuing citizen science in their classrooms.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how an intentionally planned learning environment, rich with material resources and inquiry questioning practices, supported young children's engagement with an integrated science and mathematics learning experience. A practitioner-researcher, named 'Jenny', from an Australian early year learning centre, partnered with the research team to explore how she could effectively provoke her Kindergarten (4-year-old) children's curiosity and engagement with integrated inquiry learning projects. To illustrate how Jenny used inquiry questioning frameworks to guide her children's engagement with a construction task as well as their development of science and mathematics concepts, we report and analyse a selected series of episodes from a 'Sun Protection' learning experience. Importantly, as an outcome of this study, Jenny reported an increase in her personal awareness of science and mathematics learning demands and opportunities in children's everyday activities and construction projects. She also reported that the use of inquiry questioning increased the time her children spent engaged with learning experiences and higher-order thinking.

AB  - Energy is considered both as a disciplinary core idea and as a concept cutting across science disciplines. Most previous approaches studied progressing energy understanding in specific disciplinary contexts, while disregarding the relation of understanding across them. Hence, this study provides a systematic analysis of cross-disciplinary energy learning. On the basis of a cross-sectional study with n = 742 students from grades 6, 8, and 10, we analyze students' progression in understanding energy across biology, chemistry, and physics contexts. The study is guided by three hypothetical scenarios that describe how the connection between energy understanding in the three disciplinary contexts changes across grade levels. These scenarios are compared using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results suggest that, from grade 6 to grade 10, energy understanding in the three disciplinary contexts is highly interrelated, thus indicating a parallel progression of energy understanding in the three disciplinary contexts. In our study, students from grade 6 onwards appeared to have few problems to apply one energy understanding across the three disciplinary contexts. These findings were unexpected, as previous research concluded that students likely face difficulties in connecting energy learning across disciplinary boundaries. Potential reasons for these results and the characteristics of the observed cross-disciplinary energy understanding are discussed in the light of earlier findings and implications for future research, and the teaching of energy as a core idea and a crosscutting concept are addressed.

AB  - The diversity and interdisciplinarity of computer science and the multiplicity of its uses in other sciences make it hard to define computer science and to prescribe how computer science should be carried out. The diversity of computer science also causes friction between computer scientists from different branches. Computer science curricula, as they stand, have been criticized for being unable to offer computer scientists proper methodological training or a deep understanding of different research traditions. At the Department of Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Joensuu we decided to include in our curriculum a course that offers our students an awareness of epistemological and methodological issues in computer science, and we wanted to design the course to be meaningful for practicing computer scientists. In this article the needs and aims of our course on the philosophy of computer science are discussed, and the structure and arrangements--the whys, whats, and hows--of that course are explained. The course, which is given entirely on-line, was designed for advanced graduate or postgraduate computer science students from two Finnish universities: the University of Joensuu and the University of Kuopio. The course has four relatively broad themes, and all those themes are tied to the students' everyday work or their own research topics. I have prepared course readings about each of those four themes. The course readings describe, in a compact and simple form, the cruces of the topics that are discussed in the course. The electronic version of the course readings includes hyperlinks to a large number of articles that are available on-line. The course readings are publicly available on the course home page, and they are licensed under the creative commons license. The first theme in the course is centered around a fundamental question--What is computer science? Students are introduced to the disciplinary history of computer science, to a number of characterizations of computer science made by the pioneers of the discipline, and to some methodological and epistemological viewpoints on computer science. The second theme is centered around the question--What is science? Students are introduced to, for instance, the concepts of pure and applied science, "hard" and "soft" sciences, the aims of science, the scientific method, scientific reasoning, the formation of scientific concepts and theories, and the Science Wars. The third theme concerns the division of computer science into its theoretical, engineering, and empirical traditions. The lecture notes introduce the students to descriptions of computer science that emphasize the mathematical tradition over other traditions and to descriptions that emphasize engineering or empirical traditions. The fourth theme is the philosophy of science. Throughout the course terminology of the philosophy of science is used, and the students are introduced to a number of central issues in the philosophy of science, to some of the most notable schools in the philosophy of science, and to some critical views of science. This course is aimed at providing a broad understanding of the different traditions of computer science, of the methodological differences between the branches of computer science, of the strengths and limitations of the different traditions in computer science, and of how the philosophy of science can be of help to computer scientists. In the course, critical reading and well-argumented writing are encouraged. The students learn that there are many problems that do not have clear-cut answers; they learn that there are many open problems where multiple incompatible, yet credible viewpoints can be defended. The students also learn to articulate their own positions, to defend those positions, to comment and criticize other positions, and to reflect and rethink their positions according to criticism. The students also get the chance to think about the intellectual foundations of their own work and their own research studies. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - Success in science and mathematics courses, and later in careers, requires more than disciplinary knowledge and general academic competencies. Students also need proficiency in certain key dispositions and life skills. This article is a systematic review of literature that examines what teachers believe about the non-academic skills necessary for student success in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classes and future careers in STEM fields. We report our results of the literature review and discuss these in terms of STEM SMART skills -- non-academic skills and dispositions that support students' learning across science and mathematics. These life skills and dispositions are usually not studied as academic skills; nevertheless, they are essential for long-term success in STEM fields. The acronym STEM SMART is intended to serve as a mnemonic to help educators and others remember and discuss these life skills and dispositions that support STEM learning.

AB  - In this paper, we present an activity to introduce the idea of public-key cryptography and to make pre-service STEM teachers explore fundamental informatics and mathematical concepts and methods. We follow the Theory of Didactical Situations within the Didactical Engineering methodology (both widely used in mathematics education research) to design and analyse a didactical situation about asymmetric cryptography using graphs. Following the phases of Didactical Engineering, after the preliminary analysis of the content, the constraints and conditions of the teaching context, we conceived and analysed the situation a priori, with a particular focus on the milieu (the set of elements students can interact with) and on the choices for the didactical variables. We discuss their impact on the problem-solving strategies the participants need to elaborate to decrypt an encrypted message. We implemented our situation and collected qualitative data. We then analysed a posteriori the different strategies that participants used. The comparison of the a posteriori analysis with the a priori analysis showed the learning potential of the activity. To elaborate on different problem-solving strategies, the participants need to explore and understand several concepts and methods from mathematics, informatics, and the frontier of the two disciplines, also moving between different semiotic registers.

AB  - This paper analyses the phenomena of co-existence of competing moral principles in a university merger. In doing so, the paper builds on Boltanski and Thévenot's theoretical framework of orders of worth to account for the ways in which different social actors, both inside and outside academia, actively engage in justification work to solve disputes arising from mergers between universities. This justification work is empirically explored through illustrative examples involving the university merger between the Universities of Joensuu and Kuopio, which resulted in the establishment of the University of Eastern Finland in 2010. Based on the findings, the paper offers a new micro-level insight into the composition of novel academic communities as well as academic personnel who have to cope with the plurality of moral principles and resolve legitimacy struggles on a day-to-day basis during and after the merger.

AB  - There is, in Greece, an ongoing attempt to breach the boundaries established between the different teaching-learning subjects of compulsory education. In this context, we are interested in exploring to what degree the teaching and learning of ideas from the sciences' "internal life" (Hacking, in: Pickering (ed) "Science as practice and culture," 1992) benefits from creatively coming into contact with theatrical education as part of the corresponding curriculum subject. To this end, 57 students of the Early Childhood Education Department of the University of Athens were called to study extracts from Galileo's "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, Ptolemaic and Copernican," to focus on a subject that the "Dialogue's" "interlocutors" forcefully disagree about and to theatrically represent (using shadow theatre techniques) what they considered as being the central idea of this clash of opinions. The results indicate that this attempt leads to a satisfactory understanding of ideas relating to the content and methodology of the natural sciences. At the same time, theatrical education avails itself of the representation of scientific ideas and avoids the cliches and hackneyed techniques that the (often) simplistic choices available in the educational context of early childhood education tend towards. The basic reasons for both facets of this success are: (a) Genuine scientific texts force the students to approach them with seriousness, and all the more so if these recount the manner in which scientific ideas are produced and are embedded in the historical and social context of the age that created them; (b) The theatrical framework, which essentially guides the students' activities, allows (if not obliges) them to approach scientific issues creatively; in other words, it allows them to create something related to science and recognize it as "theirs"; and, (c) Both the narrative texts describing processes of "science making" (Bruner, "J Sci Educ Technol" 1:5-12, 1992) and theatrical expression constitute fields that are characterized by what, for the students, is a common and understandable manner of expression: the narrative.

AB  - In this article I present a practical model that primary and secondary teachers might use to help students explore the intrinsic connections between science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The analogy of a Russian nesting doll (matryoshka doll) can be used to stimulate classroom conversations about the nature of STEM and lead to an understanding that there is more to the relationship between these discipline areas than is typically represented in policy documents or the media. The article also aims to provoke conversations among teachers about the strengths and limitations of these relationships and of the analogy itself.

AB  - STEM integration has attracted considerable attention in educational research, yet there has been a dearth of research exploring how STEM integration is perceived and implemented in regular school settings. The purposes of the study were to explore Taiwanese junior secondary teachers' conceptions of STEM integration with regard to their practices, investigate the ways STEM integration is implemented in the current school curricula, and analyze contextual supports and barriers to the implementations. This study adopted a qualitative research design. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 in-service teachers who delivered integrated STEM in their classrooms. The teachers' conceptions and contextual factors were analyzed using the constant comparison method, whereas the implementations were examined by the two-dimensional spectral framework proposed in the study: "disciplinarity" and "pedagogy." Three categories of teacher conceptions were identified that highlighted how STEM can bring different learning experiences to students. The implementations varied in the degree of disciplinary integration and the extent to which teacher guidance was provided. While school conditions and wider educational contexts posed challenges to STEM integration and implementation, school professional support plays a key role in facilitating integration and teaching across disciplines. This study provides insights into how teachers reconcile their conceptions with school conditions and educational contexts to implement STEM integration in regular classrooms. The two-dimensional framework remarks the values of diversity, namely, to appreciate the learning possibilities opened by varied integration approaches, promote diverse learning outcomes, and allow adaptations based on school contexts.

AB  - Conventional school science has often portrayed obesity as a self-inflicted problem. It tends to ignore perspectives at the systems level, such as social, political, marketing and economic factors that shape an obesogenic environment that determines individual eating and lifestyle patterns. Therefore, socioscientific decisions (e.g. fat tax) are likely to be biased against the obese and ultimately fail to overcome this global health challenge. Students should examine obesity from multiple perspectives to make informed decisions about it. Based on the concepts of adherence and prevalence in the conceptual change literature, this paper examines students' learning of multiple perspectives in terms of (i) a change in the number of references to different perspectives in making sense of obesity and (ii) a shift in adherence to and prevalence of different causes of obesity. A total of 114 undergraduate students from a diverse range of major subjects enrolled in a general education course about obesity participated in this study. The course design was guided by an SSI Teaching and Learning model. Pre-/post-course questionnaires, essays, and follow-up interviews were used to chart students' learning during the 12-week course and 6 months afterwards. The students became more able to explain obesity using perspectives from multiple dimensions. They adhered less strongly to personal-level causes of obesity and more accepting of systems-level perspectives. We conclude by arguing that it is not only important for teachers to enhance the number of perspectives considered by students, but also attend to their differences in weights to facilitate students' learning of SSI.

AB  - This paper summarizes our experience of teaching undergraduate robotic courses in the past ten years. The objective is to introduce students to the fundamental knowledge in robotics. Lecture topics covered subjects in both Autonomous Mobile Robots and Robotic Manipulator. In the lab sessions, students work on physical robots to acquire basic robotic design, integration, and algorithm implementation skills. The commercially-available VEX robotic kits, together with its extensions, are used as the robotic platform. By constructing an autonomous mobile base, students can explore topics pertaining to Autonomous Mobile Robots. By adding a simple robotic arm on top of the mobile base, students can investigate subjects in Robotic Manipulator. By further integrating the VEX robot with other devices such as Raspberry PI (with its camera module) and XBee modules, the enhanced VEX robots achieved onboard image processing and wireless inter-vehicle communication capabilities. More advanced topics, such as vision-based control and coordinated control, can then be brought to the undergraduate robotic classroom, boosting students' interest in robotics and the STEM fields in general. The course learning objectives of obtaining knowledge and skills in both Autonomous Mobile Robot and Robotic Manipulator were assessed using direct assessment methods via in-class exams. Students' acquired hands-on skills and their interests into robotics and general STEM fields were evaluated using indirect methods via surveys and Student Evaluation of Teaching (SETs). The combined assessment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed course content, projects, and the overall teaching approaches.

AB  - Global Public Health is a course that allows students to learn about the complexity of communicable and noncommunicable diseases, determinants of health, and delivery of health services. The Global Public Health course partnered with the Center for International Students to co-host International Education Week in November 2017. Specifically, the course held a "global successes" poster presentation event highlighting various initiatives including disease reduction, cash transfer programs, health system comparisons, and emergency preparedness. The project encouraged a dissection of the biological aspects while also focusing on the socioeconomic contexts, geo-political partners, and advocacy efforts to determine the factors that played into successful health initiatives. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected to assess project outcomes. The reach of the event was with the campus and local communities. Students reported that the project allowed them to develop an appreciation for the vastness of global health, while also identifying the importance of sustainability.

AB  - The Autonomous Vehicles (AV) are a self-driving vehicle capable of sensing its environment and operating with minimal or no human intervention converting into a fully or partially automated vehicle. These automated vehicles have great potential to revolutionize the automotive industry and our daily lives. Thus, they are receiving a lot of attention from automotive industries, governments, suppliers, educational sectors, researchers, and many other stakeholders. According to global financial service firm UBS, the AV market could reach more than $2 trillion by 2030. These projections will become reality if enough skilled workforces are produced with a high level of broad technical competencies specifically for the automotive environment. This will also require consumer education on AVs that could bring all the comfort and excitement across all segments of the population. This brings a substantial opportunity for the educational sectors in generating the workforce required in AV sectors by enhancing the existing curricula in the areas related to AVs or developing a cross-disciplinary course or capstone project that could expose students with a technical background in computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechatronics. Since AV has many technologies involved, it is challenging to design an appropriate curriculum and provide hands-on activities. Small-scale learning kits may be an affordable and effective solution for introductory courses on AVs or for beginners. This paper will discuss the use of those widely available small-scale learning kits, their benefits, and their challenges.

AB  - This study compared two versions of the same elementary science professional development (PD) and curriculum program that were offered face-to-face and completely online, while keeping all content consistent between the two. Using quantitative analyses of pre- and posttests of content knowledge (CK), we evaluated the extent to which the online version of the PD compared to the face-to-face PD for increasing the earth science and art CK of upper elementary teachers required to teach an earth science and art integrated curriculum. Additionally, we explored how the impact of PD modality (online vs. face-to-face) on teachers' CK learning outcomes differed for novice and experienced teachers. Findings revealed significantly higher CK learning gains for teachers who participated in online PD compared with face-to-face PD, but with a small effect size. Subgroup analysis revealed that compared with experienced teachers, the novice teachers had significantly higher CK gains from participating in the online PD compared to the face-to-face version with a large effect size. We also discuss the implications for the design of large-scale online teacher PD.

AB  - Employers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields report that recent graduates are deficient in important skills such as collaboration and professional writing. Scientific societies and science educators have responded to the gap between student skills and employer expectations by recommending that undergraduate STEM curricula focus on cross-disciplinary, workplace-related skills in addition to discipline-specific skills and content knowledge. This study examined the disciplinary cultures in which STEM faculty teach and STEM students learn. We developed and validated the Survey of Teaching Beliefs and Practices for Undergraduates (STEP-U), which assesses the extent to which students value specific cross-disciplinary skills, as well as their experiences with teaching practices thought to reinforce such skills. We surveyed > 2000 students majoring in biological sciences, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and computer science. We interviewed five students from each discipline to supplement survey data. Next, we surveyed faculty members (N = 147) within these disciplines regarding the extent to which they valued the same cross-disciplinary skills and how this influenced their teaching practices. Student values differed according to academic discipline, classroom experiences, and individual characteristics, such as prior research experience. We offer a conceptual framework by which the relationship between faculty values, faculty teaching practices, and student values can be studied. Specifically, it predicts that faculty values are embodied in their teaching practices, and student values are shaped by their classroom experiences, leading to transmission of disciplinary values from faculty to students. Future studies should examine these relationships across different disciplines and institution types.

AB  - Revisiting the seminal 2010 Nolan and Temple Lang article on the role of computing in the statistics curricula, we discuss several trends that have emerged over the last ten years. The rise of data science has coincided with a broadening audience for learning statistics and using computational packages and tools. It has also increased the need for communication skills. We argue that, for most of this audience, instruction should focus on foundational concepts and the early introduction of different types of data and modern methods through the use of interactive learning environments without programming prerequisites. We then describe Integrated Statistics Learning Environment (ISLE), a web-based e-learning platform and lesson authoring framework for teaching statistics. Built on top of computing and peer-to-peer technology, the platform allows collaborative data analysis and real-time interactions in the classroom. We describe how ISLE contributes to the three key Nolan and Temple Lang components: broadening the statistical computing curriculum, deepening computational reasoning and literacy, and expanding computing with data in the practice of statistics. We then present several advantages of using a computing-integrated environment such as ISLE, including promoting (cross-disciplinary) communication, supporting classroom-focused integrated development environments, and advancing the science of data science.

AB  - Various changes in the spheres of education policy and school management over recent decades have sparked a renewed interest in the issue of school culture and its potential to understand processes of leadership and academic performance. What are the contributions and potentialities of organizational culture for understanding school organizations and their leadership processes? This article has two goals: (i) to identify trends and theoretical particularities inherent to the major approaches to organizational culture, focusing on research carried out in the school setting; (ii) to debate the heuristic usefulness of a theoretical proposal for studying organizational culture in the school setting. The article presents a multidimensional analysis of school organizational culture, considering political, social and educational factors, aiming to capture the unique nature of school cultures and their links to processes of leadership and management. By linking these to different leadership perspectives, this model may inspire further comparative study of educational management in an international context. This approach demonstrates the need to tailor models for analysing organizational culture to the school environment, to achieve a deeper and more solid understanding of school life and leadership and management phenomena.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) is no longer a surprisingly novel technology. Most art educators have heard about VR, although they may not have a detailed knowledge of or experience with it. However, as VR has become commercialized, education researchers have also looked at using VR for teaching, and they have discussed its effects on students' learning. Here, the authors discuss how to adopt VR in art education and the important role of the arts in VR and VR-integrated lessons. This study proposed a new method of conducting arts-integration lessons using VR technology and shared the process and results of lessons with students who experience VR-, visual arts--, social studies--, and science-integrated lessons. This study also described how to effectively convert personal and transient VR experiences into sharable, everlasting forms of educational performance through visual arts creation. The authors provide art educators with the possibilities for immersive learning by integrating VR technologies with visual arts and other subjects. In addition, the study explains how students' experiences can be materialized within virtual and real spaces through VR visual arts integration.

AB  - This study explores benefits of studying two related subjects, mathematics and physics, in teacher education. German teacher students study two subjects as a major, which allows for investigating how the development of content knowledge in one subject, mathematics, benefits students' content knowledge in the other subject, physics. The sample included teacher students from 12 major teacher education universities in Germany. Each of the N = 104 physics teacher students, whose second subject was mathematics, answered two tests assessing their content knowledge in (1) mathematics and (2) physics. Our results reveal an influence of taking mathematics as a second subject on students' physics content knowledge. However, the effect size is only small. We found this influence increased over the course of study, indicating that the study of academic mathematics provided increasing opportunities to learn physics over the course of study. Even when controlling for general cognitive abilities, there remains substantial and significant effect of mathematics on physics content knowledge. Mathematical knowledge proves to be relevant in all physical subdomains except for optics and solid-state physics. Overall, the present study confirms benefits of studying physics when also studying mathematics, and thus a synergy effect in studying two subjects in scope of teacher education.

AB  - Background/Context: There were over 500,000 open computing jobs across the country in 2018, but only 35% of U.S. high schools offer computer science classes, and only 8-10% of STEM graduates study computer science (Code.org, 2018). In 2021, only 5.1% of all Bachelor's degrees conferred were in Computer and Information Sciences (IPEDS, 2018). STEM is the future, but the present pipeline is insufficient to meet demand. K-12 Computer Science course participation is the leading indicator of what happens in university. The College Board found that students who try AP Computer Science courses in high school are 6 times more likely to study Computer Science in college, and participation is 7 to 10 times higher for minority and female students, respectively (Wyatt, Feng, & Ewing, 2020). Purpose/Objective Research Questions: This study evaluates the impact of an intervention that integrates increased access to Computer Science Principles (CSP) with curriculum and professional development support for CSP teachers. Specifically, we examine how the design of a computer science-integrated math curriculum, the Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC), affects students' participation and performance in computer science in high school and in college. Sharing this knowledge will contribute significantly to the field, helping other secondary schools improve STEM preparation for underrepresented students nationwide. We aim to address three questions: what is the impact of enrollment in BJC Advanced Placement (AP) CSP curriculum on: 1) student AP CSP test scores, 2) student computer science attitudes and engagement, and 3) AP CSP enrollment at the school? Setting: This intervention was implemented at IDEA Public Schools, a network of charter schools based in Texas. Since 2000, IDEA has grown from a single campus serving 150 students in the Rio Grande Valley to its current enrollment of 44,653 students across 79 schools in two states and is the fastest- growing network of tuition-free, Pre-K-12 public charter schools in the United States. In spring 2021, IDEA high schools were randomly assigned to one of two AP CSP curricula in the 2021-2022 academic year, 15 schools to receive Code.org, the usual curriculum, and 15 schools to receive the Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC). Population/Participants/Subjects: IDEA's current student population across all schools is 89.2% Hispanic, 5.5% African American, 88.6% economically disadvantaged, and 32.9% English-language learners. Additionally, 45.9% are considered at-risk for dropping out of school due to multiple academic, social, and economic factors. Our target population is comprised of students, between the 9th and 12th grade, who requested to take the AP CSP course in the spring before randomization, students who did not make a spring course request, even if they enrolled into the course later, are not included in the evaluation. Intervention/Program/Practice: After randomization, teachers in schools that were assigned the BJC curriculum participated in a one- week training at the beginning of the school year. Throughout the year, teachers attended bi-weekly webinars facilitated by the CS curriculum manager at each school. Teachers were also able to collaborate and communicate through online communication channels. Teachers primarily taught with their school's adopted materials in fall 2021, but frequently used other supplementary materials in spring of 2021. Research Design: This study utilizes a Randomized Controlled Trail (RCT) design to estimate the impacts of the BJC AP CSP curriculum. Specifically, we first conduct school-level randomization blocks and then conduct a constrained randomization to balance covariates. This is to ensure that the treated and comparison schools are statistically similar at baseline. The school blocks are created based on schools' prior history of offering an AP CSP curriculum. We then implement procedures described by Morgan and Rubin (2012) to further constrain the set of possible randomizations and achieve optimal balance for two key continuous covariates: (a) prior mathematics standardized achievement and (b) prior overall grade point average (GPA). Based on the district's historical data, these two covariates emerged as the strongest predictors of our key outcome (i.e., AP CSP scores). Our main impact model is a two-level mixed-effects model estimating treatment-control differences for continuous AP CSP scores, controlling for baseline covariates and fixed effects of randomization blocks. We also conduct exploratory subgroup analyses based on student-level characteristics, such as student grade level, gender, or prior mathematics achievement. Data Collection in Analysis: We collect administrative records from IDEA public schools that include information on student enrollment, demographic characteristics, student test scores, as well as school-level demographics and prior achievement. We also conduct a survey in both the fall of 2021 and spring of 2022. In the survey, we collect data from students on their computer science engagement, computer science confidence and interests, and computer science postsecondary and career intentions. Findings/Results: About half of students initially enrolled in spring 2021 did not remain in the course or otherwise did not take the AP CSP test in spring 2022. Our baseline equivalence analyses focus on student who did remain in the AP CSP course (i.e., those with AP CSP test scores as outcomes). The main concern with attrition is that different types of students might have left the BJC and Code.org conditions, however, findings from our baseline equivalence tests provide evidence that the two groups overall remain comparable. Also, where there are some slight differences (e.g., limited English proficiency rates), we statistically control for them by including those variables as covariates in our regression model. The average AP CSP scores were low in both conditions (compared to the national average of 2.91). About one-quarter of test takers (25%) earned a passing score of 3 or higher (compared to national average of 64%). The results of our main model show that there were no statistically significant differences between the BJC and Code.org groups, nor do we find statistically significant differences for subgroups. Although the study survey response rates were low, the results of analyzing the survey data show that students in the treatment group responded more favorably on all student engagement constructs than comparison students, the size of the differences between the treatment and comparison condition were small and none were statistically significant. There were also no statistically significant differences for CS interests, confidence, or postsecondary and career intentions.

AB  - Recent studies have highlighted a fear or difficulty with the study and understanding of neuroanatomy among medical and healthcare students. This has been linked with a diminished confidence of clinical practitioners and students to manage patients with neurological conditions. The underlying reasons for this difficulty have been queried among a broad cohort of medical, dental, occupational therapy, and speech and language sciences students. Direct evidence of the students' perception regarding specific difficulties associated with learning neuroanatomy has been provided and some of the measures required to address these issues have been identified. Neuroanatomy is perceived as a more difficult subject compared to other anatomy topics (e.g., reproductive/pelvic anatomy) and not all components of the neuroanatomy curriculum are viewed as equally challenging. The difficulty in understanding neuroanatomical concepts is linked to intrinsic factors such as the inherent complex nature of the topic rather than outside influences (e.g., lecture duration). Participants reporting high levels of interest in the subject reported higher levels of knowledge, suggesting that teaching tools aimed at increasing interest, such as case-based scenarios, could facilitate acquisition of knowledge. Newer pedagogies, including web-resources and computer assisted learning (CAL) are considered important tools to improve neuroanatomy learning, whereas traditional tools such as lecture slides and notes were considered less important. In conclusion, it is suggested that understanding of neuroanatomy could be enhanced and neurophobia be decreased by purposefully designed CAL resources. This data could help curricular designers to refocus attention and guide educators to develop improved neuroanatomy web-resources in future.

AB  - Engineering is increasingly expected in elementary classrooms now that the "Next Generation Science Standards" have explicitly identified engineering disciplinary core ideas as well as engineering practices. To incorporate engineering into their elementary classrooms, the authors used building blocks (i.e., LEGOS) to help students begin to understand engineered products and how engineers work while engaging them in learning about the structure of matter. By integrating the science content alongside engineering content, the authors hope the students will better understand and apply both sets of ideas. In the lessons described in this article, students are asked to make observations and construct scientifically accurate views that objects are made of smaller pieces and how those small pieces can be used to create a new object (NGSS Lead States 2013). The authors incorporate the K-2 engineering standard that states students will create drawings or make models to illustrate how the shape of an object helps its function (NGSS Lead States 2013). Students learn how to work with constraints when incorporating engineering practices. To further expand on student thinking, both the nature of engineering and the nature of technology are included in the lessons.

AB  - Colleges are engaging students in collaborative design courses on diverse projects. More of the courses could be focusing on cross-disciplinary entrepreneurship projects including computer science and information systems students with other disciplinary students. The authors of this paper describe a course that is focusing on collaborative design and cross-disciplinary entrepreneurship on innovation projects by students as members of self-directed teams. The course is involving the students on crowdfunding projects of product prototyping, from which they are learning a marketable repertoire of skills. The findings of this paper will be beneficial to educators in colleges of computer science and information systems considering enriching pedagogical practices to be contemporary with the demands of industry.

AB  - While many university students take science courses in multiple disciplines, little is known about how they perceive common concepts from different disciplinary perspectives. Structure-property and structure-function relationships have long been considered important explanatory concepts in the disciplines of chemistry and biology, respectively. Fourteen university students concurrently enrolled in introductory chemistry and biology courses were interviewed to explore their perceptions regarding 1) the meaning of structure, properties, and function; 2) the presentation of these concepts in their courses; and 3) how these concepts might be related. Findings suggest that the concepts of structure and properties were interpreted similarly between chemistry and biology, but students more closely associated the discussion of structure-property relationships with their chemistry courses and structure-function with biology. Despite receiving little in the way of instructional support, nine students proposed a coherent conceptual relationship, indicating that structure determines properties, which determine function. Furthermore, students described ways in which they connected and benefited from their understanding. Though many students are prepared to make these connections, we would encourage instructors to engage in cross-disciplinary conversations to understand the shared goals and disciplinary distinctions regarding these important concepts in an effort to better support students unable to construct these connections for themselves.

AB  - Globalization, digitalization, and the permanent alteration of information have led to important changes in the world of work. This demands a realignment of essential skills in order to access job positions in the coming years. In order to face up to the digitalization process, education is one of the ambits that has most come to a tipping point. This adds an urgency to the need to bring skills in line with the new demands of the job market and the challenges posed in the 21st Century. The methodology was based on a systematic review of the most commonly-used databases. It analyzed and synthesized the existing information on the skills required for the future job market and educational proposals to facilitate their acquisition. At the beginning of the search, 2045 records were selected. However, following the application of the exclusion criteria, a total of 63 records were included. From this in-depth analysis, it was uncovered that the most in-demand skill for the job market relates to the management of technology. Different proposals were located which targeted these skills in educational settings. The majority of these pertained to innovative projects emanating from digital and technological phenomena.

AB  - Integration of computational data science (CDS) into the university curriculum offers several advantages for students, faculty and the institution. This article discusses the benefits to students of introducing CDS into the university curriculum with a focus on developing skills in cheminformatics, data analysis, structure--activity relationships, modelling and simulation. Moreover, CDS can enable students to engage with complex chemical and toxicological data in new and dynamic ways, helping them to develop a more nuanced understanding of the potential hazards and risks associated with different chemicals and substances. On the other hand, it can foster greater collaboration between students and faculty and with external partners in industry and government. This can lead to the development of more effective and efficient toxicological testing methods and tools to screen chemicals for potential hazards and aid the development of environmentally friendly chemicals. Overall, the integration of CDS into the university curriculum will help prepare the next generation of scientists giving them a competitive edge to make considerable contributions to green chemistry, designing safer chemicals and non-animal testing methods. It will enable them to tackle modern challenges facing society including identifying safer and more sustainable chemicals and predicting the health and environmental impacts of novel chemical substances.

AB  - Higher education has embraced integrative learning as a means of enabling students to tackle so-called "wicked" problems, i.e. problems that are sufficiently complex, contested, and ambiguous that conventional, disciplinary specific approaches are inadequate to address. However, challenges remain in defining integrative learning consistently and effectively, especially because the cognitive processes that make up an integrative learning experience are not understood fully. This mixed-methods study was designed to help understand how students perceive, navigate, and resolve challenges that require them to integrate knowledge of one "wicked" subject (sustainability) with the skills of a practice rooted in mathematical logic (computer programming); how they express their integrative learning through reflective writing; and how we gain a stronger understanding of this process through linguistic analysis. The findings suggest that some students demonstrated the ability to integrate computational reasoning skills into socially relevant contexts more successfully, confidently, and in more well-rounded ways than others, though success required ways of thinking that extended beyond programming. The findings also underscore the potential need for reconceptualizing integrative teaching and learning in fields that have problem-solving traditions rooted in less "wicked" solutions.

AB  - Morehouse School of Medicine elected to restructure its first-year medical curriculum by transitioning from a discipline-based to an integrated program. The anatomy course, with regional dissection at its core, served as the backbone for this integration by weaving the content from prior traditional courses into the curriculum around the anatomy topics. There were four primary goals for this restructuring process. Goal 1: develop new integrated courses. Course boundaries were established at locations where logical breaks in anatomy content occurred. Four new courses were created, each containing integrated subject content. Goal 2: establish a curriculum management team. The team consisted of course directors, subject specialists, and a curriculum director. This team worked together to efficiently manage the new curriculum. Goal 3: launch contemporary examination and question banking methods. An electronic system, in which images could be included, was implemented for examinations and quizzes, and for storing and refining questions. Goal 4: ensure equitable distribution of standardized examinations and course grading systems among all courses. Assessments included quizzes, in-course examinations, and National Board of Medical Examiners® (NBME®) Subject Examinations. A standard plan assigned the contribution of each to the final course grade. Significant improvement was seen on subject examinations. Once the obstacles and challenges of integration were overcome, a robust and efficient education program was developed. The curriculum is expected to continue evolving and improving, while retaining full regional dissection as a core element.

AB  - Nanoscience and nanotechnology are two key areas in the development of new technologies. However, scientific advances in these fields are still far removed from the contents taught in schools. But what if basic concepts within these areas were introduced in secondary schools? We believe science is an essential facet of culture and the most recent scientific advances should be within everyone's reach. With this in mind, we have developed and tested an educational toolkit to transfer complex scientific concepts in classrooms. The toolkit is based on design and creative thinking methodologies, and graphene is used as an example of a subject that is challenging to communicate within the area of nanoscience. This paper highlights the development of the toolkit and it being tested out in a secondary school by 93 students between the ages of 11 and 13. The testing was carried out through the creation of a workshop called "Graphene in the Classroom." We determined five evaluation categories: Acquiring Knowledge, Satisfaction, Challenges, Teamwork, and Facilitator's Role. The results show that integrating scientific content and design methodologies is a complex yet profitable strategy. The toolkit demonstrated to allow the translation of a complex language into friendlier, more approachable, and easier language. The classroom climate was positive and the presence of a facilitator enhanced motivation, empathy, scientific rigor, and adequate adaptation of contents.

AB  - This article describes a collaborative effort that included a botany professor, an art teacher, and a science teacher, called,"Plants, Pots, and Paints." This interdisciplinary project was successful in connecting content across disciplines (science to art) and for motivating fourth-and fifth-grade students to create something beautiful both they and the entire community could enjoy. Bulbs were chosen for this project because they are perennial, they bloom during the school year, and they can be "forced" to bloom in containers with proper cold treatment. Following instructions supplied with the bulbs, during October and November fourth-grade students planted an outdoor garden (an area of the schoolyard tilled by the district's building and grounds department) with crocus, iris, and daffodil bulbs purchased from a local garden center. Students were very motivated by their plant/art studies--and learning was enhanced in both subjects  because of the integration. Having learned more about plants' form and function in science class, students applied that knowledge to their drawings. Also, after dissecting plants in science class, their drawings were more informed and detailed.

AB  - According to the aims of the current junior science curriculum for Hong Kong, students are expected to master inquiry skills for problem-solving, understand the nature of scientific knowledge, and appreciate the limitations of science. These aims are, however, difficult to achieve because available science textbooks focus mainly on the transmission of scientific facts and concepts and most science teachers do not have a good understanding of the nature of science. In order to improve this situation, the Integrated Science course of the Postgraduate Diploma in Education Program of the Faculty of Education, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, has in recent years incorporated a unit that aims at facilitating teachers to construct understanding of the nature of science. This article reports a small-scale study of the effect of this unit on a group of in-service science teachers. The unit consists of a number of historical vignettes that illustrate the process of development of scientific ideas, through which teachers were guided to construct the key steps of the scientific methods and appreciate the nature of scientific knowledge. A pre-test was administered to the subjects to identify their alternative conceptions on the nature of science. Comparison of the scores of the pre-test and post-test indicates that the subjects were found to demonstrate substantial improvement in their understanding of the nature of science after intervention, but some alternative conceptions were still persistent in most subjects. Implications were made for ways to integrate the historical approach into science teaching in schools. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)

AB  - Increasing the inclusion of underrepresented individuals in coding is an intractable problem, with a variety of initiatives trying to improve the situation. Many of these initiatives involve STEAM education, which combines the arts with traditional STEM disciplines. Evidence is emerging that this approach is making headway on this complex problem. We present one such initiative, iLumiDance Coding, which attempts to pique the interest and increase confidence of students in coding, by combining it with a fun and physical activity: dance. The connections between dance and coding, while not immediately obvious, are authentic, and we hypothesize that this approach will increase student comfort level with coding. We used student surveys of attitudes toward coding and a variety of statistical approaches to analyze our initiative. Each analysis showed a positive effect on student comfort level with coding. These results are useful for both educators and researchers since they contribute to a deeper understanding of how to increase interest in coding, which we hope will lead to an increase in representation.

AB  - This paper presents research on how children aged 5-11 can create stories through computer programming (coding). A novel 'Story-Writing-Coding' engine is introduced where children realise their imagined stories through code that results in animations representing their stories. Analysis of how they manipulated code to represent story meaning is presented, together with a hypothetical model of the strategies they used in composition. Using the context of multimodal literacy, it is argued that coding can be thought of as a form of literacy and that taking this perspective may lead to benefits for children as both literacy learners and also learners of computer programming. While the authors have worked with 103 children, the results presented in this paper are drawn from an in-depth analysis of 20 stories with associated code together with observations by the authors. It was found that children are able to manipulate code creatively to obtain meaningful stories and successfully use the modes of print, static and moving images.

AB  - We report on the use of bilingual constructed response science assessments in the context of a research and development partnership with secondary school science teachers. Given the power that assessments have in today's education systems, our project provided a series of workshops for teachers where they explored students' emergent reform-oriented science meaning-making in our project-designed assessments. Within the context of these workshops, we used discourse analysis to explore how three different groups grappled with the new reform-oriented relationship between science and language: (1) the research team's emergent understandings of how to create improved resources for teachers to better integrate science and language; (2) students' emergent understandings as expressed in their assessment responses; and (3) teachers' emergent understandings of how to integrate science and language in their instruction as expressed in interviews in the teacher writing workshops. Implications for curriculum designers, assessment developers, and professional learning facilitators are discussed.

AB  - Providing challenging and engaging learning opportunities is one way to motivate students to learn. In this article, we discuss the contributions of the gifted education field to the development of enrichment pedagogy and identify several different types of these engaging instructional strategies, including interest-based learning pedagogy, differentiation and curriculum compacting, project-based learning, open-ended choice, and the application of creative productivity to students learning. We identify this specialized pedagogy and give examples of how these exciting pedagogical strategies can be implemented in classrooms and by enrichment specialists and school counselors, both for academically talented and for all students. We conclude with a brief overview of research that demonstrates longitudinal benefits for students who are exposed to this type of teaching, suggesting positive outcomes.

AB  - Constructing explanations of scientific concepts is one of the most frequent strategies used in the science classroom and is a high-leverage teaching practice. This study analysed the explanations provided by student teachers in STEM areas from a socio-materiality perspective focused on verbal and nonverbal language and representations. The study was conducted in a hybrid research format by scholars and a preservice teacher. First, the study compared the representational elements used by 86 student teachers to construct explanations about various concepts in a roleplay setting. Next, a positioning analysis was done by a preservice teacher, to a selection of five of these explanations focused on the concept of "force". The positioning analysis highlighted the embedded voices in the construction of explanations, with a focus on the intersection between science and language. The results showed that the student teachers created explanations as static artefacts, mainly using examples, graphs and images to clarify the concepts. The voices of learners and scientists were mostly absent from the explanations, which led to the presentation of explanations in STEM areas as finished and unquestionable artefacts, with references neither to nature nor to the history of science. We reflect on the meanings attributed to learning to be a practitioner in the context of interconnecting science and language through explanations, as a process of meaning (re)production within the classroom. Implications for teacher education are discussed in order to enhance student teachers' awareness about constructing knowledge by enacting explanations in the science classroom.

AB  - This study aimed to raise awareness of maker education for pre-service teachers and discuss maker education in their major subjects by developing and applying a maker education course for pre-service teachers with various majors based on novel engineering (NE), a teaching and learning method that combines humanities and engineering. Accordingly, the course was developed following the procedure of the Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation (ADDIE) model, and the educational effectiveness was investigated using test tools. The educational effect and difficulties were also examined through the analysis of reflective journals written by 20 pre-service teachers with various majors who participated in the course. To investigate the educational effectiveness of the developed course, the science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) literacy of the participants--before and after the course--was measured, with the results demonstrating a statistically significant improvement. Analysis of the reflective journals identified a recognition of sharing effectiveness, the joy of making, and an in-depth understanding of maker education as education effects, and a lack of understanding of techniques, the burden of prototype fabrication, and the limitation of majoring subjects as difficulties experienced during the activities. This study verified that NE could be used as a significant maker education measure for pre-service teachers with various majors. Based on this verification, this study also proposes a strategy to develop more effective NE-based maker education.

AB  - The use of integrated science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instruction has the affordances of combining harmonious content area connections into real-world experiences that are both engaging and challenging. This article introduces findings from a study that used an integrated robotics module to expose in-service and preservice teachers to the engineering design process, programming, mathematical connections and context, and problem-based learning. With participants ranging from novice to advanced user, this integrated module proved that given the appropriate scaffolding, anyone can successfully program a robot and have fun while engaging in STEM learning along the way. Implications lead to the conclusion that teacher preparation programs should integrate activities such as this to better equip teachers to engage students in the wonders of STEM in their own classrooms.

AB  - The image is the raw material of the twenty-first century. Images infiltrate all social and cultural spaces. Its digital-mediated realities drive communication, industry and knowledge. Images saturate life and adolescent learners are familiar with the participatory nature of image production and its social, educational and personal communicative realities. Vision and visibility, seeing and being now dominate how we inter-subjectively recognise ourselves and perform our world. We also find our aesthetic and embodied self increasingly constituted within imaging acts that are relational. Visual culture may have colonised the self and learning, but imagination is without borders. The current pictorial turn opens possibilities to explore truth in flux through visual artistic acts. This article embeds Deleuzian method, which is one of intuitions, going beyond the actual, or our limited forms of representing life, to recognising that life has future imaginative potential forms and is always becoming. The article discusses an arts-based inquiry project for gifted artist visualiser/learners at an Australian regional university who are given broad topics on science phenomena and asked to give them expression. It suggests that pedagogies of the visual with their performative acts can prise open curriculum where an art-science interchange between two disciplines is made difficult by the current siloed nature of curriculum knowledge. Drawing on an analysis of Anika's and Joel's artworks and visual diaries it aims to reveal how their learning events dwell and are performed in aesthetic borderlands and how visual pedagogies forge new fluid visual borderlands and new learning.

AB  - This paper explores how Engineering students and Work and Welfare students reflect upon their own engagement in a one-week cross-disciplinary project. To develop a better understanding of what unfolds during these activities we collected data through anonymous surveys two consecutive years. Data from these 141 respondents were analysed using a learning history approach and are presented as narratives. Results show major disruptions and conflicts driving the student projects, exposing inviting confrontations, social identity threats, managing diversity, and friction of ideas. Whereas this in many cases led to new and better project solutions, these real-world experiences raise awareness of the need for tools and methods for training students. The aim of the paper is to learn from students' experiences through narrative distance, and fill a gap in the literature between problem-based learning (PBL) and the learning history method. Discussing different experiences of cross-disciplinary teamwork through the explanations of these theories, we also lay out potential questions for future research on the topic.

AB  - This study explores boundary-crossing interaction between two grade 5/6 science classrooms that operated as knowledge building communities. The two classrooms studied human body systems with the support of the Knowledge Forum over a ten-week period. The knowledge building practice integrated student-driven inquiry and discourse within each community and cross-community interaction mediated through "super notes" posted in a cross-community meta-space. Students co-authored super notes as epistemic boundary objects, each of which synthesized knowledge progress in an emergent line of inquiry for cross-community sharing. Qualitative analyses of classroom videos, online discourse, and interviews provide a rich description of how the students conceived, generated, and interacted with the super notes for knowledge building. The processes to transcend student ideas toward the higher social levels for sharing through boundary-crossing further served as a larger context for idea development toward higher epistemic levels. Incorporating cross-community interaction is important for scaling CSCL-based classroom practices in a way that fosters high-level epistemic engagement.

AB  - At Tecumseh Middle School in Indiana the technology education teachers are part of a team consisting of language arts, math, social studies, and science teachers who work together on items of common interest and student needs. There is a scheduled period each day for instructors to meet to develop plans and activities to help students become more productive. Science teacher Doug Hauser wanted to develop an activity that would provide the students with hands-on, inquiry-based learning. He studied the Indiana State Science Standards and determined that the area least covered was physical science, specifically forces and motion. He remembered producing a Pinewood Derby Car when he was younger, and really liked its possibilities. He purchased two of the kits and started looking for grants to purchase kits for the students. This article describes the different activities that the students were able to perform with these car kits. The purpose of this article is to provide some ideas or methods to encourage students to try harder and learn more as they participate in class.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of task relevance instructions and topic beliefs on reading processes and memory for belief-related text. Undergraduates received task instructions (focus on arguments for vs. against) before reading a dual-position text. In Experiment 1 (n = 88), a reading time methodology showed no differences in reading time for task-relevant and task-irrelevant text, but participants recalled task-relevant text better than task-irrelevant text independently of whether the information was consistent with their topic beliefs. In Experiment 2 (n = 76), a think-aloud methodology showed that participants engaged in confirmation strategies when reading belief-consistent text and disconfirmation strategies when reading belief-inconsistent text, independently of whether the information was relevant to their task instructions. Nonetheless, participants recalled task-relevant text better than task-irrelevant text. The results indicate that task relevance instructions affect memory independently of beliefs but that beliefs affect processing independently of task relevance instructions. Thus, moment-by-moment reading processes and memory for text can operate differently as a function of topic beliefs.

AB  - Study abroad provides many opportunities for students. My own college's goals for international programs state that "students are expected to gain new perspectives on their fields of study, develop intercultural competencies and communication skills, learn others' perspectives, and reflect on their own assumptions and values while abroad" (Beloit College Office of International Education, 2005). Research abroad by students ideally provides these same benefits, better preparing them to function in their chosen fields. The views expressed in this essay come from my perspective as a biology and geology professor who has had the opportunity to travel and do research in a number of different and diverse countries. In addition, they stem from conversations with liberal-arts-college students, and with Sarah Davidson. Three aspects of research abroad are pertinent to this discussion: different approaches to science research, the need to have global coverage in our studies, and the site-specific nature of many scientific studies.

AB  - This article aims to identify the challenges and opportunities in cross-program problem-based learning (PBL) in higher education, based on an Industry 4.0 case with undergraduate and graduate students studying for engineering degrees. The method for this research comprised a cross-program course structured to bring together undergraduate and graduate students using a PBL approach. Five Industry 4.0-related projects were developed in collaboration with four multinational companies. The authors present the results of the projects and feedback from students, professors and industry partners. The results and feedback led to empirical findings on the challenges and opportunities of cross-program PBL in higher education. The findings contribute to the design and implementation of teaching and learning practices and educational policies at undergraduate and graduate levels. In the approach adopted, the undergraduate students acquired hands-on experience while the graduate students had the opportunity to supervise applied research and practice. The study highlights practices that can help to better prepare future industry professionals.

AB  - In many schools following the National Curriculum for England the teaching of science has been overshadowed by the demands of literacy and numeracy, with the focus on statutory testing (SATs) and emphasis on national targets. This has often led to increasing concerns around teachers' subject knowledge, the sapping of teacher confidence and reduction of interesting, engaging science lessons. However, in Wales the forthcoming return of science as a tested subject is seen in year 6 (ages 10-11) and new routes into this subject need to be developed. How is this relevant to UK schools more widely? The author provides examples of how poetry can be used to develop scientific enquiry and method, while inspiring scientific learning using rich tasks that open doors to fantastic worlds of wonder.

AB  - Science courses employ instructional strategies that are based on lecture, drill, and practice to help students memorize collections of facts and procedures of increasing complexity. These strategies emphasize the acquisition of knowledge through the development of logical-mathematical skills employed in problem solving and verbal-linguistic abilities to make sense of the concepts and jargon in the field. Due to its highly abstract character, these science courses deal with complex representations that require an understanding of the role of mental models. Learners need to develop their visual-spatial skills as a means of gradually acquiring visual literacy while grappling with the symbols and conventions displayed in the figures, diagrams, and charts in textbooks. The Art & Science Project started at Vanier College as part of the History of Science course in the liberal arts program and was later adapted for use in three core chemistry courses (General, Solution, and Organic Chemistry) in the science program. The project uses a cross-disciplinary integration between visual arts and the natural sciences to promote a deeper understanding of the role of models. The liberal arts students analyze the parallels between the evolution of modern scientific concepts and the art movements from the same historical periods. Science students create visual representations that portray core ideas and threshold concepts in the field. The goal is to portray these abstractions using visual arts as means of creating meaning through symbolic visual representations while developing new perceptions of visual forms.
