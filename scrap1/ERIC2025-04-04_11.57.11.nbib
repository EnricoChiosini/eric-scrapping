AB  - The old division of labour between fundamental and applied or problem-oriented research has almost disappeared, and with it, the functional distinctions between universities, public labs and industrial and other private research. Doctoral research training can then also become diversified in terms of its content and its location. Closer analysis of ongoing changes, in particular, the emergence of a regime of strategic science, is necessary to specify requirements for a career in science in the coming decades. Disciplines as we know them may not be of major importance, but interdisciplinarity as such is not the answer. For universities, the key challenge is to diversify and recombine, both cognitively and institutionally, into what I call a post-modern university, which includes overlaps and alliances with centres (of excellence and relevance), public labs and various private organizations. In such a university, a doctoral student can wend his or her way through the types of locations, just as is to be expected of his or her later career.

AB  - In this paper we report on the sustained research and development work at the AMSTEL Institute of the University of Amsterdam to improve mathematics and science education at primary and secondary school level, which has lead amongst other things to the development of the integrated computer working environment Coach 6. This environment consists of integrated tools for data collection (through measurement with sensors or collection of data on video clips and digital images), for control of processes and devices, for processing and analyzing data, for construction, simulation, animation, and validation of computer models, and for authoring of activities by teachers and students. It is meant to facilitate the students' construction of in-depth and integrated understanding of mathematics and science concepts and processes through inquiry. This is realized by offering students the opportunity to work directly with high-quality, real-time data by means of tools that resemble technologies used by "real" scientists. We review the R&D work at AMSTEL in the Dutch perspective on introducing learning technologies in school mathematics and science. We also present an illustrated review of the principled design and implementation of Coach 6. (Contains 6 figures.)

AB  - One of the major teaching challenges of higher education is helping students to bridge knowledge with real life practice. This is especially important in applied fields including medicine, social science, education and engineering. Traditionally, practicum and internship programs are the only means for students to step outside of classroom learning and to connect with the outside world, and a chance to apply what they learn to real life problems. Increasingly, information and communication technology (ICT) is being used to create yet another dimension for authentic learning beyond the boundaries of the classrooms, and in addition afford collaborative and flexible learning mode. This paper details a collaborative effort between the engineering and the education disciplines, in using ICT to support students' professional growth in teacher education. An eLearning platform was created as a result of the joint effort for the training of student teachers in developing their professional knowledge in teaching and learning and gaining understanding of the work of a teacher. Through the platform, student teachers gain understanding about the teaching profession from different people of the education sector; and they can reflect and share their teaching practicum experiences with each other using the online communication tools.

AB  - The question of where to locate teaching about the relationships between science and religion has produced a long-running debate. Currently, science and religious education (RE) are statutory subjects in England and are taught in secondary schools by different teachers. This paper reports on an interview study in which 16 teachers gave their perceptions of their roles and responsibilities when teaching topics that bridge science and religion and the extent to which they collaborated with teachers in the other subject areas. We found that in this sample, teachers reported very little collaboration between the curriculum areas. Although the science curriculum makes no mention of religion, all the science teachers said that their approaches to such topics were affected by their recognition that some pupils held religious beliefs. All the RE teachers reported struggling to ensure students know of a range of views about how science and religion relate. The paper concludes with a discussion about implications for curriculum design and teacher training.

AB  - I begin by examining the natures of science and religion before looking at the ways in which they relate to one another. I then look at a number of case studies that centre on the relationships between science and religion, including attempts to find mechanisms for divine action in quantum theory and chaos theory, creationism, genetic engineering and the writings of Richard Dawkins. Finally, I consider some of the pedagogical issues that would need to be considered if the science/religion issue is to be addressed in the classroom. I conclude that there are increasing arguments in favour of science educators teaching about the science/religion issue. The principal reason for this is to help students better to learn science. However, such teaching makes greater demands on science educators than has generally been the case. Certain of these demands are identified and some specific suggestions are made as to how a science educator might deal with the science/religion issue. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of an integrated science and mathematics methods course on preservice early childhood teachers' efficacy beliefs for integrating these content areas. Thirty-four preservice teachers participated in this study, which utilized a quasi-experimental design with two treatment groups. Participants in two cohorts were tested to assess their efficacy beliefs for teaching science, mathematics, and integrated science and mathematics before and immediately after instruction that lasted 8 weeks. Results indicated a statistically significant change in preservice teachers' efficacy beliefs scores from pre- to posttest measures. These results provide evidence that the methods course utilized in the present study was effective in enhancing preservice teachers' efficacy beliefs for integrating science and mathematics.

AB  - Gender is an essential determinant of health and illness. Gender awareness in doctors contributes to equity and equality in health and aims towards better health for men and women. Nevertheless, gender has largely been ignored in medicine. First, it is stated that medicine was "gender blind" by not considering gender whenever relevant. Secondly, medicine is said to be "male biased" because the largest body of knowledge on health and illness is about men and their health. Thirdly, gender role ideology negatively influences treatment and health outcomes. Finally, gender inequality has been overlooked as a determinant of health and illness. The uptake of gender issues in medical education brings about specific challenges for several reasons. For instance, the political-ideological connotations of gender issues create resistance especially in traditionalists in medical schools. Secondly, it is necessary to clarify which gender issues must be integrated in which domains. Also, some are interdisciplinary issues and as such more difficult to integrate. Finally, schools need assistance with implementation. The integration of psychosocial issues along with biomedical ones in clinical cases, the dissemination of literature and education material, staff education, and efforts towards structural embedding of gender in curricula are determining factors for successful implementation. Gender equity is not a spontaneous process. Medical education provides specific opportunities that may contribute to transformation for medical schools educate future doctors for future patients in future settings. Consequently, future benefits legitimize the integration of gender as a qualitative investment in medical education.

AB  - Causal mechanistic reasoning is a thinking strategy that can help students explain complex phenomena using core ideas commonly emphasized in separate undergraduate courses, as it requires students to identify underlying entities, unpack their relevant properties and interactions, and link them to construct mechanistic explanations. As a cross-disciplinary group of biologists, chemists, and teacher educators, we designed a scaffolded set of tasks that require content knowledge from biology and chemistry to construct nested hierarchical mechanistic explanations that span three scales (molecular, macromolecular, and cellular). We examined student explanations across seven introductory and upper-level biology and chemistry courses to determine how the construction of mechanistic explanations varied across courses and the relationship between the construction of mechanistic explanations at different scales. We found non-, partial, and complete mechanistic explanations in all courses and at each scale. Complete mechanistic explanation construction was lowest in introductory chemistry, about the same across biology and organic chemistry, and highest in biochemistry. Across tasks, the construction of a mechanistic explanation at a smaller scale was associated with constructing a mechanistic explanation for larger scales; however, the use of molecular scale disciplinary resources was only associated with complete mechanistic explanations at the macromolecular, not cellular scale.

AB  - Extracurricular campus activities mirror the effects of associational life on political participation (Kuh 1995; Pascarella, Ethington, and Smart 1988; Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995). As encouraging student participation in such activities can be difficult (Kuh, Schuh, Whitt, Andreas, Lyons, Strange, Krehbiel, and MacKay 1991), this project describes an effort to promote peer enhancement of campus life. Students in a persuasion course developed a campaign to increase participation on campus. Pre- and postsemester questionnaires, as well as focus groups, reveal that students anticipated participating in more campus and community activities, and their attitudes toward the purpose of college broadened. Self-efficacy regarding several political tasks also improved. Students in a control group experienced no similar changes, suggesting that classroom activities can address current college students' political apathy. The conclusion calls for political scientists, who are the most familiar with declining political participation and the ameliorating effects of associational life, to initiate interdisciplinary interventions with the potential to reach the most alienated college students.

AB  - Reconceptualized Family Resemblance Approach to Nature of Science (RFN) explains science as a cognitive, epistemic, and social institutional system. The aim of this study is to examine the inclusion of Nature of Science (NOS) in the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th grade Turkish middle school science textbooks. The "content," "activity," and "assessment" sections of each science textbook were traced based on RFN categories which are "aims and values (AV)," "scientific practices (SP)," "methods and methodological rules (M)," "scientific knowledge (SK)," and "social institutional systems (SI)" through content analysis. As a result, the total frequency value of the codes regarding RFN categories was found to be 196 in the 5th grade, 548 in the 6th grade, 284 in the 7th grade, and 427 in the 8th grade science textbooks. Most references to NOS were found in the "activity" sections of the textbooks. Although there are some references to NOS in each textbook, some of the RFN categories in the whole textbooks are missing. Furthermore, a consistent progression for the frequency of NOS related keywords was not found throughout the grade levels. In conclusion, there is a need to integrate NOS into science textbooks holistically and in a balanced way to provide a vertical articulation throughout the grade levels.

AB  - Finnish early childhood education can be defined as practical educational activity, as a discipline, or as a field of science. This study focuses on the academic connections of early childhood education and concentrates on the identification of actors according to Bourdieu's field theory. The roots of academic early childhood education go back only a short way, to the 1970s. The study is of current interest as early childhood education established its position in the field of education as late as the middle of the 1990s when a number of chairs were founded. The material of our study consisted of documents in connection with the appointments of professors, in particular the expert statements. Our study method was material-based content analysis. The mainstream of early childhood education can be defined, in the same way as sciences of education, as a multidisciplinary field of science where the most favoured substance of educational psychology approaches and is integrated into the social capital; early childhood education is always linked to the family, lifespan and society in a complex way.

AB  - What happens when an old farmstead, native tall-grass prairie, and middle school students are mixed together? Would one guess learning? That is exactly what is happening in Fergus Falls, Minnesota, where students from a rural middle school have joined with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to restore native tallgrass prairie. In the process, the lines between traditional subject areas are blurring as the local environment becomes the context for integrating science, math, and writing. Growing out of a dream of developing a school located on the prairie where children learn about the natural environment, this partnership is proving that integrated science makes sense. Today, 100 students attend school daily at the Prairie Wetlands Learning Center (PWLC), a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service site. These students, known as the Prairie Science Class, are discovering that using their local environment helps learning come alive and brings new meaning to their study of basic subject areas.

AB  - Ask many elementary school teachers or principals, and they will say that science and music are not the top priority in their classrooms. Teachers need to know "how" they can incorporate the necessary mathematics and reading goals and objectives while still engaging students in the critical and aesthetic thinking developed through science and music. It was this concern that brought the authors--science educators and a music educator--together to develop a lesson to integrate their subjects for classroom instruction. A natural link between science and music--sound--also provided a nice backdrop to highlight students' backgrounds. To integrate science, music, and culture may seem complex. However, one way that this may be accomplished is through a systems approach to teaching. A systems approach allows for a single system to be more fully examined in isolation. "A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts and Core Ideas" (NRC 2012) defines the "Systems and System Models" as a small group of related components that is isolated from the larger system. The focus of a systems approach is on the relationships and connections between the parts as applied to a specific context while moving away from focusing on the individual parts (Llewellyn and Johnson 2008). Taking a systems approach allows scientists and students to investigate a small portion of a concept to understand the forces acting on that system. The lesson described in this article demonstrates how sound waves can be seen as a subsystem of musical acoustics or the physics of music (Sullivan 2008). Within this system, sound waves are analyzed in terms of the pitch (high and low), loudness (loud or soft), and timbre (quality of sound). However, music is more than individual notes played in isolation. Music is organized notes in sequences that tell a story about the feelings and ideas the composer wants to invoke in the listener. It is this nature of music that makes it a cultural experience; each culture shares its own beliefs, ideas, and experiences through a variety of instruments and sounds. The objectives of the lesson described here are for fourth-grade students to learn about sound waves as created by a variety of musical instruments in order to develop a model of sound waves by recognizing the similarities and differences in patterns caused by a series of sounds. One of several goals is for students to develop a model of the relationship between loudness and pitch with respect to a stringed instrument (e.g., guitar) in order to apply this knowledge to building their own instrument. With regards to the National Standards for Music Education (MENC 1994), the teachers wanted their students to listen to, analyze, and describe music by identifying the properties of sounds created by a variety of instruments using appropriate terminology (i.e., "timbre" and "sound quality") in explaining the sounds heard as well as develop perceptual skills about music from various cultures. They also wanted to capitalize on the cultural diversity of students by highlighting each individual's unique experiences and knowledge of music. Building on the students' everyday context is important for providing a meaningful experience by celebrating the diversity among students in the classroom.

AB  - The rationale for the first-year seminar is to introduce freshmen to the university. The basic components of a first-year seminar are academic integrity, skill development, a sense of community, active and collaborative learning strategies, and technology. All freshmen must take a first-year seminar that consists primarily of freshmen, although upperclassmen may take the seminar depending on the course number. In this article, the authors present an interdisciplinary study of the SARS virus which provides opportunities for students in different disciplines to discuss the origin; spread; and global, economic, chemical, and biological aspects of the disease. Students benefit from these active discussions with each other and share their knowledge with others in a semester-end poster session. The authors conclude that teaching a first-year seminar on the SARS virus was exciting and enjoyable. Moreover, the academic and intellectual challenge of preparing to teach a new course is rewarded many times over by the sharing and learning that occurred with the students on a daily basis.

AB  - Although argumentation is a critical historical component of scientific literacy, the recent coronavirus pandemic and associated issues have highlighted the importance of argumentation in science practice. Argumentation that aligns with functional scientific literacy requires gathering evidence and reasoning to support or refute claims related to socioscientific issues (SSI)--those informed by science but also affected by society. In this article, we present a 5E module that models argumentation instruction while scaffolding preservice elementary teachers' argumentation practice in the context of SSI. To do so, we introduced the claim-evidence-reasoning argumentation framework. In this approach, students responded to potential solutions to SSI related to the coronavirus (claim), supported their responses with data (evidence), and justified how the evidence they provided supported their responses (reasoning). Specifically, preservice elementary teachers completed diverse argumentation tasks--starting with more traditional scientific argumentation and building toward recognizing and addressing nonscientific, cross-curricular issues--to develop effective argumentation practice concerning contemporary SSI.

AB  - This article describes dance/STEAM-based educational workshops for 3rd and 4th graders at a local science museum led by the artistic director and members of a professional dance company and supported by a large university research community. The overarching pedagogical goal was to use dance to learn about science and science to learn about dance. The workshops were part of a large multimedia dance project inspired by human microbiome research. Mirroring the dance company's process, students explored various methods of embodied investigation. Using their whole bodies, they manipulated props to physicalize scientific concepts such as homeostasis and symbiosis. Microbes, viewed on video, led to students creating microbe-inspired movement phrases. Community skill building, discussion, and concepts from science and Laban Movement Analysis were woven throughout. Culminating "microbe performances" for teachers and facilitators allowed students to assimilate and celebrate their new holistic knowledge and to make meaning by integrating dance and science.

AB  - The new Science and Technology Curriculum Framework recently issued in Taiwan advocates the teaching of integrated science and technology with greater emphasis on basic skills. Science teachers are not used to teach in this way, they need different abilities and skills in order to do so. Using various effective professional development strategies, including a collaborative action research approach, the aim of this study was to help science teachers develop professionally through the development of instructional modules on integrated science and technology. A research team was formed consisting of science educators/researchers, graduate assistants and science teachers from six junior high schools in the central area of Taiwan. In order to involve teachers collaboratively over an extended period of time, the entire study went through preparatory, elaborative and disseminative stages for three consecutive years. Various professional development opportunities were built-in. The instructional modules developed were discussed by participants of this study and evaluated by external experts before they were tried out in actual classroom settings. Both qualitative and quantitative methods, including field notes, interviews, observations, video-taping, audio-taping, document analysis, and surveys of students' and teachers' opinions were used to collect data for a closer examination of the effectiveness of the instructional modules and of the increase in teachers' instructional proficiencies. Overall, teachers' interdisciplinary experiences and knowledge increased. They were more flexible and resourceful in using instructional strategies that best fit the instructional settings. Their knowledge and skills in using information and communication technologies in science classrooms also increased considerably.

AB  - The implementation of science reform must be viewed as a systems-level problem and not just focus on resources for teachers and students. High-capacity instructional leadership is essential for supporting classroom science instruction. Recent reform efforts include a shift from learning about science facts to figuring out scientific phenomena in which students use science practices as they build and apply disciplinary core ideas. We report findings from a research study on professional development (PD) to support instructional leaders' learning about the science practices. After participating in the PD, the instructional leaders' familiarity with and leadership content knowledge of the science practices significantly improved. Initially, principals used their understandings from other disciplines and content neutral visions of classrooms to make sense of science instruction. For example, they initially used their understandings of models and argument from ELA and math to make sense of science classroom instruction. Furthermore, some principals focused on content neutral strategies, like a clear objective. Over the course of the PD workshops, principals took up the language of the science practices in more nuanced and sophisticated ways. Principals' use of the language of the science practices became more frequent and shifted from identifying or defining them to considering quality and implementation in science classrooms. As we design tools to support science, we need to consider instructional leaders as important stakeholders and develop resources to specifically meet their needs. If the science feels too unfamiliar or intimidating, principals may avoid or reframe science reform efforts. Consequently, it is important to leverage instructional leaders' resources from other disciplines and content neutral strategies as bridges for building understanding in science. We argue that the science practices are one potential lever to engage in this work and shift instructional leaders' understandings of science instruction.

AB  - Anatomy is one of the leading subjects in health science, and students need a strong anatomy background in these fields. Traditional lecturer-oriented anatomy education is based predominantly on passive learning methods. In recent years, alternative educational methods like hands-on art and 3D atlas-based education methods have become more popular as competitive alternatives to traditional approaches. This is a prospective, randomized, longitudinal, interventional study, and a total of 181 undergraduate students participated in this study. A comparative design was used with two groups: Artwork and Atlas. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of creative and artistic approaches in improving undergraduate students' attitudes and self-efficacy toward anatomy courses. A Pearson correlation, an independent t-test, and a paired t-test were used to analyze the results. Both groups experienced a negative mean score on the anatomy self-efficacy scale, suggesting an increase in anatomy self-efficacy, and showed significant self-efficacy improvements (p < 0.005). An independent t-test analysis found no statistically significant difference between the Atlas group and the Artwork group on the anatomy self-efficacy scales (pretest and posttest) and the anatomy attitudes scale (p > 0.005). Artwork-based education and learning methods can be used as active learning methods to improve students' self-efficacy toward anatomy. This method allows learners to employ their creative abilities in order to express their ideas visually, making complex concepts easier to comprehend. It can also help students develop practical, problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork skills. It is cost-effective and engaging since it does not need any expensive equipment.

AB  - The decrease in urban green spaces limits the opportunities for adults and children to experience nature and learn about the environment. Yet, it is only when children experience nature in the outdoors that they can learn best to love it and strive to preserve it. As such, the need to include biodiversity studies in the curriculum becomes a pressing demand on today's teachers. In this article, the authors describe how they established a long-term plant biodiversity study of a forested urban green space and suggest how other teachers and students could implement this study. In their study, the authors worked with middle school and high school students, both within a classroom setting and as a part of extracurricular activities. The authors found that the effectiveness was uniform across the entire spectrum of age groups and settings; the level of motivation and enthusiasm among students was very high in all groups. In this article, the author provides details of how they set up plots and initially collected data for their long-term plant biodiversity study, as well as suggestions for how such data may be analyzed. The authors also show how their project tied in with the "National Standards for Science Education" and its interdisciplinary connections. In the second part of the article, the authors highlight changes to conduct the study even with limited resources. Their guidelines can be used to set up plots in any forested green space in any school's vicinity. (Contains 5 figures and 3 tables.)

AB  - Teachers' lack of knowledge abound computational thinking (CT) and limited opportunities to incorporate CT in existing curricula pose unique challenges at the elementary level. Despite the crucial role of professional development (PD) in preparing elementary school teachers to integrate CT in classroom instruction, there is little research documenting PD programs that focus on integration in literacy and mathematics compared to other subject areas. In this work, we present a PD program that integrates CT with disciplinary content to support teachers as they integrate CT with literacy and mathematics in elementary school classrooms. Using data from multiple sources, we present findings from two case studies to examine the impact of PD on teachers' integration of CT with content in lesson planning and implementation. Findings have implications related to the integration of CT in elementary school and teacher PD.

AB  - Interprofessional education (IPE) in clinical practice is believed to improve outcomes in health care delivery. Integrating teaching and learning objectives through cross discipline student interaction in basic sciences has the potential to initiate interprofessional collaboration at the early stages of health care education. Student attitudes and effectiveness of IPE in the context of a combined gross anatomy course for first-year students in Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) and Doctor of Medicine (MD) degrees curricula were evaluated. Integrated teams of MD and DPT students participated in part of the gross anatomy dissection course at Mayo Medical School. A survey was administered to 42 MD and 28 DPT students that assessed their attitudes toward IPE and cooperation among health care professionals. Pre- and post-experience surveys were evaluated. Positive comments were related to opportunities for developing a better understanding of the nature and scope of each other's programs, encouraging teamwork and communication, mutual respect, and reducing the perceptual divide between disciplines. Ninety-two percent of the students agreed that interprofessional learning would help them in becoming a more effective member of the health care team. This initial experience with IPE in gross anatomy provides a basis for continued development of interdisciplinary educational strategies. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Highly interesting but unimportant seductive details are commonly added to scientific texts, harming reader comprehension and memory for important content while also potentially evoking a strong emotional response. In two experiments, the effects of seductive details on participants' memory and emotional responses to seductive and nonseductive scientific texts were explored. In Experiment 1, participants read two scientific texts on related scientific topics with embedded seductive details and rated the sentences for importance and interest. In Experiment 2, participants read and then recalled one seductive and one nonseductive scientific text and rated the emotional responses they experienced during one reading task and one recall task. Participants rated seductive details as more interesting than important and recalled fewer scientific concepts from seductive texts compared to nonseductive texts. Although negative emotions were predictive of better recall of scientific concepts, the presence of seductive details and positive emotions were predictive of a reduced recall performance.

AB  - Discipline-based education research (DBER) conducted by faculty within geoscience departments can address identified needs in undergraduate geoscience education. This study explores the evolution of undergraduate geoscience education research (GER) from 1985 to 2016, primarily in terms of the types of published research and secondarily in terms of the insights this literature offers on the evolution of GER as a scholarly discipline. Stokes' (1997) quadrant model of research types is used as a theoretical framework for the former and Kuhn's (1970) model of disciplinary paradigm for the latter. An exploratory sequential mixed-methods approach to a systematic literature review of 1,760 articles is utilized. The period 1985-2000 is characterized by proto-research as evidenced by the abundance of instructive and informational education articles rather than research articles. From 2000 to 2011, GER underwent a growth period characterized by the presence of applied, use-inspired, and pure basic research. The period 2011-2016 appears to be a period of relative steady-state conditions in the normalized number of GER publications per year. Existing gaps in knowledge about geoscience education, the evident unfamiliarity with education and social science research methodologies among authors of GER articles, and efforts to build consensus about what GER is and how to conduct it suggest that GER is preparadigmatic or at a low paradigm state. That is, GER is an immature discipline as far as the evolution of a discipline goes. A path forward is proposed for the continued evolutionary growth of GER. This study provides new perspectives on the emergence of GER as a discipline that can be used as a basis for studies on cross-disciplinary DBER comparisons.

AB  - It is generally accepted that the environmental education deals with a wide range of environmental experiences, methods and processes. Teaching the subject of the environment should not be considered as an easy task. It should not only cover pure ecology education; but also include the citizenship responsibilities and the problems that are sourced from other interdisciplinary factors. Therefore teachers should have the responsibility to facilitate environmental issues. Hitherto no researcher has undertaken a comprehensive study that focuses on environmental education in teacher training programs. This study aims to detect basic environmental knowledge of Turkish teacher candidate at the onset of their studies. This study has been conducted during in the fall of 2007 with a heterogeneous group of 248 teacher candidates from Education Faculty in Turkey, 82 students chosen from randomly from biology, science and 84 students from classroom teacher departments. To detect respondents' basic knowledge about environmental pollutants we administrated the questionnaire during the 1st month of their last academic year. The results found in this research have shown that teacher candidates possess less pro environmental knowledge. An interpretation of these results is that the teacher candidates do not fully comprehend the underlying ecological and environmental concepts related to environmental issues. Therefore, the design of pre service programs should take into account the characteristic of the student population which are the outcome of their social, cultural, and physical environments, and include all the necessary components for adequately preparing future educators to effectively address the environmental education of their future students. This may reflect into pupils' attitudes during teaching process in primary and secondary schools. (Contains 5 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - Nanoscience and Technology (NST) have revolutionized the world. It has led to many innovations since it entered our lives. Meanwhile, the number and quality of people trained in this field gained importance. Currently, initiatives are being taken to integrate this field into the primary education curriculum in many countries. This study focuses on integrating NST into the curriculum as a primary education topic. In this context, meta-synthesis research was used. First, developed countries' well-known initiatives on adapting NST to the curriculum will be discussed in the paper. Then, the works on NST in the literature, especially experimental ones, will be addressed. Finally, based on the results, some suggestions will be made for creating a curriculum in this field. Although there are differences in countries' curriculums, the basic knowledge necessary for education in this field is also outlined.

AB  - The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) delineate three interrelated dimensions that describe what students should know and how they should engage in science learning. These present significant challenges for assessment because traditional assessments may not be able to capture the ways in which students engage with content. Science simulations engage students with science phenomena while collecting data on student simulation use. However, there are limited guidelines on how to analyze this type of complex data for assessment. This study aims to investigate how two statistical approaches (Bayesian Networks and Item Response Theory) model student learning in a science simulation. The simulation data included process data, embedded table responses, and open-response reflection answers. The results did not suggest a best model for this data, but highlighted uses and challenges of the different models and illustrate a method for utilizing complex data to help understand both what and how students are learning.

AB  - As evidenced by national data, a large proportion of students in middle school, content area classrooms in the United States (U.S.) may be considered developing readers. Evidence-based literacy practices and explicit instructional practices can support these students' literacy development. Yet, research suggests that teachers often miss opportunities to integrate evidence-based literacy practices to support students' access to text, and little is known about middle school teachers' use of explicit instructional practices. In this observation study, we document 17 U.S. middle school teachers' use of both explicit instructional practices and evidence-based literacy practices across 51 lessons in general education language arts, science, and social studies classrooms. We find that most explicit instructional practices and literacy practices were infrequently utilized across all content areas; within some content areas, some of these important practices were not used at all. We discuss the contexts in which explicit instruction and/or evidenced-based literacy instruction did occur, and the importance of school-wide literacy models and related professional learning opportunities to increase middle school content-area teachers' ability to support developing readers.

AB  - Michel Serres is a provocative and unorthodox thinker, very little known in the English-speaking world, although he is one of the best-known contemporary French philosophers. Serres' interdisciplinary writing constructs themes that can be traced across literature, philosophy, science, mythology and painting, borrowing ideas and approaches from them and transforming those into original and synthetic voices in the world of knowledge. By grounding the sciences into everyday life, Serres wants to eliminate the distance that is perceived to exist between the two. Serres' mode of thinking and writing is undoubtedly inventive and provocative and his project truly admirable, if one considers the recent debates over the "science wars". As Maria Assad (1999) points out, Serres "brought a radical twist to the controversy over the degree to which scientific discourse and literary and philosophical theories can coincide without weakening the persuasive force of their respective models" (pp. 1-2). What is this radical twist brought by Serres? Simply put, his aim is to bridge the sciences with literature and philosophy. Serres' "will to synthesis", as he described his philosophy, is particularly important for education, culture and science in the new century. In this essay, the author undertakes the task of examining some major themes that organise Serres' philosophy about science, philosophy, and literature and he explores the implications of his ideas for science and education. His main argument is to show that Serres can promote refreshing ideas that will provoke educators to rethink some of the views they take for granted. (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - College honors courses provide an opportunity to tackle controversial topics in an atmosphere that encourages active learning, critical thinking, and open discussion. This venue is particularly appropriate for examining the debate about teaching intelligent design (ID) in public school science classes. A one-credit honors enrichment seminar taught at the University of North Carolina Wilmington provides a model, with associated successes and challenges, for addressing the controversy. This interdisciplinary course consisted primarily of discussions based on a set of weekly readings that presented contrasting viewpoints on evolution and naturalism, ID, theology, and educational issues. In preparation for each class, students constructed charts contrasting the views of each writer on key points presented in the readings and summarizing their own responses. Discussion focused on a set of questions arising from the readings and designed to provoke debate. The "Kitzmiller v. Dover" decision served as a final case study; each student prepared a final paper defending or criticizing Judge Jones' decision in the Dover court case. Prior to the course, some students had not heard of ID and many had limited knowledge of evolution. The course improved student knowledge of evolution, ID, and the issues involved in the controversy, preparing them to make informed political decisions. Challenges included the uneven level of knowledge about evolution among students in this non-science course and the time constraints of a 1-credit course. In addition, because I had decided to serve as a facilitator and not press my opinions, misconceptions were more difficult to correct, although the variety of disciplines represented by the students allowed them to correct one another.

AB  - Reading texts can prompt intense emotions, and these emotions profoundly influence learning from texts. I first discuss the findings from the eight studies reported in this special issue. The studies represent pivotal advances in research on reading. Focusing on learning from science texts, they show that different emotions and different types of text influence reading in different ways. Furthermore, they document how the interplay of emotions, text features, and reading processes impacts knowledge acquisition, conceptual change, and attitude change. I then outline core directions for future research. We need to: (a) expand current theories to adequately explain the multiple links between emotions, cognitive processes, and motivational processes during reading; (b) use causal designs to disentangle the cause-effect relations linking these processes to antecedents and outcomes, including reciprocal causation; (c) complement between-person designs with intra-individual analysis; (d) use dynamic measurement and multichannel indicators to capture emotional processes; and (e) investigate the generalizability of current findings across diverse groups of learners and sociocultural contexts.

AB  - Over the past few decades, the practice of education and training has been shifting from traditional knowledge transmission approaches to constructivist approaches of knowledge construction. This evolution is supported by research in cognitive science, education, and discourse processes. Constructivist theories of learning assume that students use their prior knowledge to construct new knowledge that is relevant to their individual experiences and the texts that they read. There also is a widespread belief that knowledge construction is facilitated by technology and multiple channels of communication. Given the enormous increase of networked multi-channeled technologies, researchers have been exploring how people construct knowledge in an interactive environment. The aim of this special issue is to identify some models of the cognitive discourse and linguistic processes that underlie knowledge construction and to analyze how such processes are supported in technologies with diverse channels of communication.

AB  - In the framework of a curriculum reform in the Netherlands, an interdisciplinary open inquiry assignment has been introduced as a part of the final secondary school examinations. We developed and evaluated a preparatory open inquiry assignment to be used in science and mathematics departments of schools, in collaboration with each other: the falling cones assignment. However, teachers encountered two content problems, that hindered the (guiding of) the open inquiry process. Physics educators solved the problems and showed how the solution can be used in guiding students for inquiry learning.

AB  - This study examined 57 learners' emotions (i.e., joy, anger, confusion, frustration) as they engaged with scientific content while learning about microbiology with Crystal Island, a game-based learning environment (GBLE). Measures of learners' prior knowledge, in-game text comprehension, facial expressions of emotion, and posttest reading comprehension were collected to examine the relationship between emotions and single- and multiple-text comprehension. Analyses found that both discrete and non-discrete emotions were expressed during reading and answering in-game assessments of single-text comprehension. Learners expressed greater joy during reading and greater expressions of anger, confusion, and frustration during in-game assessments. Further results found that learners who expressed a high number of different emotions throughout reading and completing in-game assessments tended to have lower in-game comprehension scores whereas a higher number of different expressed emotions while completing in-game assessments was associated with greater posttest comprehension. Finally, while increased prior knowledge was associated with higher single- and multiple-text comprehension, there was no interaction between prior knowledge and emotions on multiple-text comprehension. Overall, this study found that (1) learners often express more than one emotion during GBLE activities, (2) emotions expressed while learning with a GBLE shift across different activities, and (3) emotions are related to demonstrated comprehension, but the type of activity influences this relationship. Results from this study provide implications for how emotions can be examined as learners engage in GBLE activities as well as the design of GBLEs to support learners' emotions accounting for different activity demands to increase comprehension of single and multiple texts.

AB  - Integrating advanced biological techniques into instruction at non-R1 institutions can prove to be a challenge. Here, we report the creation of a model for the introduction of gene expression microarray technology into a research laboratory. A student assessment tool was used to evaluate: (1) technical skill development; (2) cross-disciplinary issues; (3) development of trouble-shooting skills; and (4) career evaluation. The exposure of "Saccharomyces cerevisiae" yeast cells to three plasticizers served as a template for the introduction of this technology. Cells were harvested at mid-log phase, and RNA was extracted. The mRNA was converted to cDNA by using reverse transcriptase primers containing a capture sequence that was later recognized by a fluorescent dendrimer by using cyanine (Cy)3 or Cy5 dyes. cDNA was hybridized onto yeast microarray chips provided by the Genome Consortium for Active Teaching. Exposure to phthalate plasticizers revealed genes with differential gene expression. Trouble-shooting approaches were used as learning opportunities for the evaluation of RNA extraction methods, and data analysis highlighted the use of mathematics in a molecular biology context. This article describes a promising model for the introduction of interdisciplinary, student-based projects involving microarray technology at non-R1 undergraduate institutions.

AB  - This paper describes a pedagogical technique employed for an interdisciplinary course on Cold War America. Students had to "become" a fictional person and discuss how political and social changes during the Cold War era would have impacted that person. By doing a semester-long project that required primary source research, this "quasi-experiential" technique helped students gain a greater appreciation for Cold War culture and a more thorough understanding of the major political events of the era. (Contains 1 table and 4 notes.)
