AB  - Employing student-driven project work in a higher education setting challenges not only the way in which we understand students' learning and how we define the expected learning outcomes, it also challenges our ways of assessing students' learning. This paper will address this question specifically and illustrate with a case that highlights some of the challenges that may arise in practice when assessing student-driven, problem-based projects. The case involved an assessment situation in which a discrepancy arose between the internal and external examiner in relation to what was valued. The discrepancy had consequences not only for the concrete assessment of students' work, but also for the validity of the problem-based university pedagogy in general, and it raised the question of how to assess students' work adequately. The research focus of this study was to explore the implications of assessing student-driven projects within a progressive approach to higher education teaching, along with the potential underlying issues. We found a need for clear assessment criteria while insisting on a space for students' creativity and reflexivity as essential parts of a learning process. The paper thus makes a case for the notion of reflexivity as an assessment criterion to be integrated into learning objectives.

AB  - Technological innovations have led to an increase in demand for information technology (IT) skills in contemporary library and information agencies. This in turn has created an increased need for pedagogical skills on the part of library and information science (LIS) professionals for them to empower users with knowledge and skills to navigate a complex digital information terrain. Hence LIS professionals with both technology and pedagogical skills have become increasingly critical in a digitized information environment. In the context of this confluence of knowledge and skills requirements for the LIS professional, this article draws early findings from a global phenomenological probe into curriculum design and development directed at the blended or hybrid LIS professional located in a pluralist information environment and requiring cross-disciplinary competencies spanning LIS, IT, teaching and learning, and perhaps even other cognate areas. It explores, in this context, challenges, ideas, and thinking in LIS education from preliminary empirical findings from parts of Africa, Asia, and South America (representing the Global South) and from parts of Europe and North America (representing the Global North), with a view to stimulating debate and discourse on the repositioning of the LIS discipline toward staking an intellectual claim on the broadening of its disciplinary space resulting from a natural evolution of the LIS discipline in response to a technology-driven information environment. Shank and Bell's concepts of "disruptive innovations" and the blending of traditional librarian skills with information technology and pedagogical skills, together with Corrall's "content, conduit, and context" approach to educating for a pluralist digital information environment, are used to frame this reflection.

AB  - Integrating content and language (ICL) has been a widely applied methodology of language learning and teaching in the last 20 years. However, ICL studies for first-year undergraduate students of science and engineering are scarce. This study examined perceptions of incoming students and professors who participated in ICL classes at a Korean science and engineering school. Most of the participants found the ICL classes helpful for students to develop a better understanding of content lectures and what to expect in regular content lectures. Also, many students found student-centered activities, consisting of group work, particularly motivating and effective. The study recommends a formula of ICL instruction for students entering a university with an EMI policy and concludes with suggestions for the successful implementation of ICL classes for content lectures in the areas of science and engineering.

AB  - This study was conducted to confirm the specifications of the laboratory and the list of practice tools for technology education in elementary schools in Korea. For effective technology education, standardized laboratory specifications and a list of practice tools are needed. However, there were no standardized laboratory specifications and a list of practice tools for elementary school students in Korea, so there were many difficulties in practicing related to technology education at the elementary level. In particular, elementary-level technology education is combined with home economic and agricultural education within the subject of practical art subjects in Korea. Therefore, the laboratory should have a complex function so that it is not only for technology education but also to enable practice in other fields. The name of the lab is "The Practical Arts Laboratory" in elementary schools in Korea. The study design and method to achieve the study purpose are as follows. First, in the theoretical analysis stage, the concept of the laboratory and considerations for designing the laboratory were confirmed through the review of previous studies. Next, a list of practice tools was derived using the big data analysis method. Then, in the actual design stage, the practical arts laboratory was designed and an expert feasibility study was conducted. The results of the study are as follows. First, the minimum area of the practical arts laboratory is 13,600mm√ó12,450mm, which is twice the size of a general classroom. In addition to the practical arts laboratory, a preparation room for storing practice tools is also required. The minimum area of the preparation room is 12,450mm√ó3,500mm, which is 1/4 the size of practical arts laboratory. Second, the practice table in the practical arts laboratory was designed as a comprehensive practice table that allows various types of practice, and the area was designed to be 600mm√ó1,200mm in consideration of the Korean work area. Third, the number of practice tables was set to six considering the size of the practical arts laboratory and the number of people per class in elementary schools in Korea. As of 2018, the number of people per class at an elementary school in Korea was 23.1, so four people were set to use one practice table. Practice is a key element in technology education. Thus, it will be said that the practical arts laboratory plays a very important role in Korea's elementary level technology education as an environmental background that makes the practice effective. For this reason, the standard specifications of the practical arts laboratory and the list of practice tools presented in this study are expected to contribute to the development of elementary-level technology education in Korea. Also, our results can be a reference for other countries in the world that have a similar situation to Korea.

AB  - Purpose: This article aims at presenting the original design of the teaching of Economic and Social Sciences (SES) in the French High School and at demonstrating that the issue of pluralism lies at the core of the various controversies surrounding it since its creation. Approach: This article is based on more than 40 interviews with SES teachers and key personalities, on curricula and official reports analyses and on a ten years participating observation in the SES teachers professional association. Findings: This text strives to display how the defense of pluralism has become a core issue to SES teachers, as a "mobilized group" as well as in their individual professional practices. Research implications: Such statements may be deepen in two directions. The first consists in comparing the French situation to that in other countries as regards the teaching of economics and social sciences in high school. The second may imply to investigate deeper about teachers' training and practices about such issues. Practical implications: The other aim of this text is raising debates about the objectives of teaching economics and social sciences in general in high school in a context where school is more and more committed to strengthening citizenship as well as preparing for higher education and professional life.

AB  - The "Next Generation Science Standards" and other educational reforms support the formation of deep connections across the STEM disciplines. Integrated STEM is considered as a best practice by the educational communities of the disparate disciplines. However, the integration of non-STEM disciplines is understudied and generally limited to the integration of art (STEAM). Humanistic STEM blends the study of STEM with interest in and concern for human affairs, welfare, values, or culture. This study looks at an infusion of the humanities into an online chemistry course to see if there is an influence on student connection between course content and cross-disciplinary perspectives. Specifically, students were asked about the course making clear connection to STEM disciplines, between science and non-science, between science and the real world, and a widened perspective of science connection other courses in their degree programs. Items on a Likert scale were presented as part of the end of course evaluations and yielded 59 responses. Although no statistically significant difference in the pre- and post-infusion agreement, it is evident that the additional perspectives did no harm. The positive movement in this pilot study encourages further investigation with stronger infusions of both STEM and humanities content.

AB  - Advances in nanotechnology have drawn attention to nanotechnology education. The aim of this study is to determine awareness, exposure, and knowledge levels of science (physics, chemistry and biology) teachers about nanoscience and nanotechnology. Teachers (N=624) from secondary schools in Turkey comprised the working group. Descriptive methods were used in data analyses. Awareness and exposure subscales were adopted from the "Nanotechnology Awareness Instrument" developed by Dyehouse et al. (2008), and the knowledge subscale, developed by the authors, was added to the Turkish version. Differences among or between the teachers' awareness, exposure, and knowledge levels regarding nanoscience and nanotechnology were determined. No significant differences were found in levels of awareness, exposure, and knowledge of teachers in terms of subject specialisation and educational levels; however, some significant differences were found in gender, tenure, grade and type of school, in-service training participation, following scientific publications, documentary watching frequency and school localisation variables. In general, nanoscience and nanotechnology awareness, exposure, and knowledge levels of the teachers were at a "neutral" level. This study shows needs for further training of science teachers in nanoscience and nanotechnology, to increase their level of awareness and knowledge and to ensure their preparedness for teaching this topic.

AB  - STEM integration holds significant promise for supporting students in making connections among ideas and ways of thinking that might otherwise remain "siloed." Nevertheless, activities that integrate disciplines can present challenges to learners. In particular, they can require students to shift epistemological framing, demands that can be overlooked by designers and facilitators. We analyze how students in an 8th grade mathematics classroom reasoned about circles, across math and coding activities. One student showed evidence of shifting fluently between different frames as facilitators had expected. The dramatic change in his contributions gauge the demands of the activities, as do the contributions of other students, who appeared to work within different frames. Our findings have relevance for the design and facilitation of integrated STEM learning environments to support students in navigating such frame-shifts.

AB  - Background: This introductory guide presents the main two analytical approaches used by molecular geneticists: linkage and association. Methods: Traditional linkage and association methods are described, along with more recent advances in methodologies such as those using a variance components approach. Results: New methods are being developed all the time but the core principles of linkage and association remain the same. The basis of linkage is the transmission of a marker along with a disease within families, whereas association is based on the comparison of marker frequencies in case and control groups. Conclusions: It is becoming increasingly clear that effect sizes of individual markers on diseases and traits are likely to be very small. As such, much greater power is needed, and correspondingly greater sample sizes. Although non-replication is still a problem, molecular genetic studies in some areas such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are starting to show greater convergence. Epidemiologists and other researchers with large well-characterized samples will be well placed to use these methods. Inter-disciplinary studies can then ask far more interesting questions such as those relating to developmental, multivariate and gene-environment interaction hypotheses.

AB  - Nanotechnology is an emergent technology that holds much promise and excitement. The ability to control and manipulate matter at the most basic level--atoms and molecules--offers possibilities that transcend traditional science discipline boundaries. This interdisciplinary nature of nanotechnology provides many avenues for teachers to connect the field to their courses. The science community is interested in nanotechnology primarily because the scale of the work opens new and largely unexplored terrain. To understand the reason for the excitement and promise related to nanotechnology, students must be able to conceptualize the nanoscale. Although there is not a rigid boundary of the range of sizes encompassed by the nanoscale, a common definition is that it is from 1 nm to 100 nm. The concept of how scale affects systems and organisms is central to many science disciplines, and it serves as one of only four unifying themes that Project 2061 has identified as important for all students. However, students and adults have difficulty conceptualizing nanoscale. Relative scale is easier to grasp than absolute scale, and the dominant reference benchmark for relative scale is one's own size. One strategy for enhancing students' understanding of nanoscale is to shift students' existing understandings of relative scale by helping them conceptually transport their strongest scale benchmark--themselves--into the nanoscale world. This article describes a set of activities to scaffold high school students' nanoscale conceptions and to help them appreciate the scale at which nanotechnology operates, both in a relative and an absolute sense.

AB  - This article presents a rejoinder to the commentaries on the authors' article titled, "Instructionally Supportive Accountability Tests in Science: A Viable Assessment Option?" The commentaries offer a series of well warranted cautions regarding the adoption of any form of large-scale accountability testing. However, the authors contend that, taking these cautions into serious consideration, science education in the United States will soon be influenced greatly by 50 sets of NCLB tests. The authors assert that instructionally supportive accountability tests represent the most appropriate way to cope with the realities of the current NCLB-governed educational scene in the United States. Here, the authors briefly discuss a few specific points in the comments. They stress that instructionally supportive accountability tests can, in today's world, play a useful role in stimulating suitable science instruction.

AB  - In this article, the author presents a two-week evolution unit for his biology class. He uses Maria Sybilla Merian (1647-1717) as an example of an Enlightenment mind at work--in this case a woman recognized as one of the great artists and natural scientists of her time. Her representations of butterflies, caterpillars and their pupae, and the vegetation on which they are found are examples that show she was looking closely and intently at nature. Merian is a particularly good example of an Enlightenment individual because she not only rendered her subjects with great precision, she also included life cycle stages and food sources, linking insects and plants with ecological insight well over a century before the word "ecology" was first defined. The author uses Merian's work to inspire students to make careful drawings of anatomy, which raise questions that echo the evolutionary questions of the 19th century. Students learn that evolutionary science--whether based on old-fashioned natural history or modern ecology, genetics, and molecular biology--can be a profoundly rewarding aesthetic experience. A unit outline of this two-week interdisciplinary study of evolution is also included in this article. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - School instruction is critical for helping students use energy as a lens for making sense of phenomena, however, students often struggle to see the usefulness of energy analysis for interpreting the world around them. One reason for this may be an over-reliance on the idea of energy forms in introductory energy instruction, which may unintentionally suppress, rather than prompt, insights into how and why phenomena occur. We argue that an approach to energy instruction that emphasizes energy transfers between systems, and does not require the idea of energy forms, provides students with a more consistent and useful set of tools for interpreting phenomena. Such a perspective requires connecting the energy concept to the notion that fields, which mediate interaction-at-a-distance, are a real physical system that can transfer energy -- an idea that is rarely presented in middle school science. We outline an instructional approach in which middle school students learn to interpret phenomena by modelling energy transfers between systems of interacting objects and fields. We argue that this approach presents a more physically accurate picture of energy, helps align energy instruction across disciplines, and supports students in seeing the value of energy as a lens for making sense of phenomena.

AB  - The College of Health, Psychology, and Social Care at the University of Derby has transformed its Interprofessional Education (IPE) offer from a top-down standalone event into a five-year strategy designed and delivered in genuine collaboration with students. Across the higher education sector, IPE has been a struggle, tokenistic at best, with limited buy-in from students. When academic-led it prevents deep learning; however, by utilising an informal education approach students bring their life, programme, and practice learning together to genuinely break down barriers between professional disciplines. This paper will use an autoethnographic case study to explore the challenges and opportunities of genuine collaboration based on youth work principles in the creation of a 'value-added curriculum', not aligned to modules or assessments. It found that buy-in from academics and students comes when students are empowered to take the lead. This is based on youth work pedagogical principles of group work, relationships with shrinking professional distance, critical pedagogy, genuine agency, and an emotional connection made between the professionals and service users. It suggests the potential is considerable as youth workers bring their pedagogical practice to a broader range of spaces within and beyond higher education.

AB  - This study, in which the explanatory mixed design was used, has two aims. The first aim is the development of a scale to determine teachers' beliefs about the integration of mathematics and children's literature. The second one is to examine the beliefs of teachers on children's literature and mathematics teaching, with the data collected through the scale. The items of the scale developed within the scope of the study were created based on the literature and the opinions of 56 teachers who were aware of this topic (phase 1). The draft scale was applied to 392 teachers. After the validity and reliability studies, the scale was finalized. Accordingly, the scale has four dimensions and 33 items: positive pedagogical effects of the integration, the role of resources influencing the integration process, teacher competencies that make the integration process difficult and social norms, and teacher competencies that facilitate the integration process (phase 2). The data were collected from 772 pre-school, primary, and middle school teachers (phase 3) to reveal teachers' beliefs about the mathematics and children's literature integration through the final form of the scale. The results indicate that pre-school teachers have much higher scores in contrast to the primary and middle school teachers except for the dimension of the role of resources influencing the integration process, and novice teachers have more positive beliefs about the positive pedagogical effects of integration and their competencies in this regard. Also, the beliefs about the integration process significantly vary based on the awareness levels about integration.

AB  - Addressing honors education and undergraduate research at the community college level is a question that is becoming more prevalent in the teaching landscape. Undergraduate research is encouraged as literature supports the role it plays in developing engaged students who are interested in the field of political science and academia in general. Applying this concept to the community college level requires shifting in understanding regarding the types of students that are mentored and the expectations assigned to the research. Upper-level students have the advantage of more years in school and a connection to the discipline by majoring in the field; expanding on this approach at the community college level requires a shift by the professor or mentor to meet academic standards. This reflective essay recounts the implementation of mandatory original methodology research in a general education state government course within a community college honors program. Experience working with students at this level in political science has revealed a need to be flexible and challenging regarding curriculum and level of methods training if community college undergraduate research in the discipline is to be successful.

AB  - This theoretical paper explores the need for enhanced, intersectional computing identity theory for the purpose of developing a diverse group of computer scientists for the future. Greater theoretical understanding of the identity formation process specifically for computing is needed in order to understand how students come to understand themselves as computer scientists. To ensure that the next generation of computer scientists is diverse, this paper presents a case for examining identity development intersectionally, understanding the ways in which women and underrepresented students may have difficulty identifying as computer scientists and be systematically oppressed in their pursuit of computer science careers. Through a review of the available scholarship, this paper suggests that creating greater theoretical understanding of the computing identity development process will inform the way in which educational stakeholders consider computer science practices and policies.

AB  - This study explored the organization of contents in the junior secondary science curriculum of Bangladesh. The research questions of this study focus on how science content is sequenced and integrated in the intended curriculum. Document analysis within a qualitative approach has been followed to conduct this study. Both junior secondary science curriculum and textbooks have been analyzed to address the research questions. This study finds that the current science curriculum at the junior secondary level is not well-organized in terms of sequencing and integration. No principle of sequencing content is followed in most cases. It is noted that in the case of intergrades vertical sequencing, "spiral sequencing" is partially followed in a few cases. This study also finds that the current science curriculum does not integrate the content adequately. Intradisciplinary integration, i.e. integrating different subdisciplines of science, has been tried but the level of integration is not adequate rather it is very low. This study recommends that curriculum developers make efforts to make the content better organized in both curriculum and textbooks by following the principles of sequencing and integration.

AB  - Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) entered the general lexicon in the United States within the last ten years. Both Presidents Obama and Trump emphasized STEM education as a priority for the United States because the number of college graduates with STEM degrees is perceived as an important factor contributing to the global competitiveness of the United States. STEM refers to four disciplines but the acronym is generally interpreted to mean science or math rather than technology or engineering because only science and mathematics are included oftentimes in the school curriculum. In this paper, we describe our attempts to teach integrated STEM units to grades 3-8 students based on five different articles. The first two articles describe how we engaged grades 3-5 elementary students, in two different engineering design challenges (soda can crusher design and trash grabber design) by using our engineering design model. The third article summarizes how we taught epistemological aspects of engineering using picture books within an engineering design challenge. The fourth article illustrates how students in groups of two or three created biomimetic robots with coding. The fifth article details how students built an animatronic zoo showcasing a particular biome and animals living in it by using computational thinking.

AB  - There is currently significant interest in 3D fabrication in middle school classrooms. At its best 3D printing can be utilized in authentic design projects that integrate math, science, and technology, which facilitate deep learning by students. In essence, students are able to tinker in a virtual world using 3D design software and then tinker in the real world using printed parts. We describe a professional development activity we designed to enable middle school teachers who had taken part in a three-year Math Science Partnership program to authentically integrate 3D printing into design-based lessons. We include some examples of successful design-based lesson plans.

AB  - In recent years, Australian schools have become increasingly multilingual, with students needing targeted support to develop academic English, yet¬†also bringing rich linguistic and cultural resources to the classroom. Policymakers have recognised the critical role of identifying and describing the language and literacy demands in all disciplines, highlighting an essential role for pre-service teacher training. This article presents various components of teacher learning made available to 11 Australian science¬†pre-service teachers (PSTs) enrolled in a Masters language and literacy course, which included a practicum component and explicit training in elements of translanguaging pedagogy. It analyses the ways in which the training contributed to PSTs' developing scientific pedagogical language knowledge. In doing so, it charts their emerging professional identities as teachers as they are trained to analyse core scientific content for opportunities to provide targeted language and literacy support, as well as their growing understanding of the diversity of language and literacy strengths and challenges faced by their multilingual learners. Furthermore, this paper outlines PSTs' evolving self-reflection as they come to assume responsibility for their students' language and literacy development as a key way of facilitating their access to scientific curriculum content knowledge.

AB  - In the United Kingdom, the number of mature students studying in higher education is diminishing. This is also the case within the subject of art and design. This article reports on a project "Mature Students Matter," a study that aims to widen participation in art and design education within a small specialist university. The approach was developed from a Research Development Fellowship, which provided a model for the project. A case study is used as a method of inquiry through which the project is described and evaluated using a form of narrative inquiry. The study found that the principles of Joint Practice Development (JPD) underpinning the design and development of the project enabled practitioners from different parts of the university to work together and to share similar aims, objectives and values in their research. Drawing some tentative conclusions, the project also found that the wider institutional context was important in the success of the project.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of a mixed format, experiential course on changes in Honors students' attitudes about various issues of inequality. Methodology: Students enrolled in the course (N = 75), taught during the 2016 Presidential election, were asked about their opinions on a variety of inequality topics using a pre- and post-test survey, with the post-test survey including questions on how perceptions of inequality had changed over the course of the semester. Findings and implications: Results indicate that some students became more self-aware of their position in society and were less sure that people in general, and they themselves in particular, would be responsible for their own success. Importantly, students were less likely to believe that people faced fair and equal opportunities in the labor market and their overall level of support for unions increased during the semester. Most students agreed that the outside speakers, a key component of the course, provided new information on various aspects of inequality and impacted their overall perceptions of inequality. However, students were much less agreed on how they felt both about the future of the country and the future of inequality.

AB  - To promote social consciousness and a sense of responsibility, educational proposals organised around the principles of technology-enhanced project-based language learning (Dooly & Sadler, 2016) should engage students in a process of reflecting upon and responding to crucial social issues. Thus, in this paper we will present a project carried out by two groups of primary education students who launched a solidarity campaign to collect money for four Syrian children living in a refugee camp in Greece. The project was implemented in a cross-disciplinary Arts and Crafts class taught through English and resulted in significant outputs in English (those addressed to the Syrian children) and in Catalan (those targeted at the local community). First, we outline the student-led project and then we analyse some fragments of student plurilingual practices during the project development that demonstrate their learning gains. Our findings reveal that our meaningful contextualised cross-disciplinary project favoured the natural integration of multiple skills, competences, and field knowledge form various disciplines while promoting a sense of social consciousness and empathy. First, it enabled children to put their plurilingual competence into play and take decisions regarding language choices to meet particular communicative objectives. Second, it contributed to the acquisition of 21st century knowledge, competence, and skills, while helping the learners gain social values. Third, it engaged learners in processes of problem solving, decision making and creative thinking that lead to the development of entrepreneurial competencies. To conclude we argue that when young learners are given responsibilities and opportunities to take up socially relevant challenges learning becomes meaningful for them and those around them.

AB  - This article describes a visual approach to integrating observational data into self-evaluation and peer review of teaching, practices that can lead to adoption of evidence-based active-learning strategies in STEM. This approach was designed to be implemented for undergraduate courses across disciplines. The presentation of observational data in a timeline provides a "big-picture" view of an observed class that captures the sequencing of instructional strategies and the "ebbs and flows" of student participation--in a chronological format that coheres with how instructors often visualize a class session.

AB  - Trends toward short-term academic service-learning abroad necessitate programs designed to maximize effectiveness and measurement of outcomes. The current study sought to strategically foster and measure increases in global mindedness during an immersive community-based global learning program abroad. University students studying either Computer Science or Spanish collaborated to design curriculum and host a technology summer camp for junior-high students in the Dominican Republic. The semester before the two-week travel experience included extensive pre-departure preparation, collaboration, reflection, and communication among students, program directors, on-site program coordinators, and stakeholders in the host community. Results of pre- and post-tests using the Global Mindedness Scale indicate perceptions of five dimensions of global mindedness (i.e., responsibility, cultural pluralism, efficacy, global centrism, and interconnectedness) were significantly increased after participating in this program. Pre-departure activities, curricular design, and logistical elements of the program are discussed, along with recommendations for future research.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: This paper investigates the factors contributing to student IT self-leadership in online education using an exploratory study. Specifically, our goal was to understand whether the instructors' transformational IT leadership and the students' personal innovativeness with IT contributed to student IT self-leadership. Background: The study was conducted in an online course. While today's students are expected to be IT natives, they still lack the skills to find and learn technologies on their own. This is problematic for both online education and students' future careers. Directed-teaching methods are not appropriate to solve this kind of problem, a more constructivist teaching method is appropriate. We recommend that instructors adopt transformational IT leadership to set norms around technology use, to be role models in using online course technologies with utmost knowledge, and to encourage and support the students in their use of IT. Methodology: An exploratory research is conducted with 46 students in an online management information systems course at a public university. The data were analyzed using PLS structural equation modeling technique. Contribution: This paper introduces the unique concepts of student IT self-leadership and instructors' transformational IT leadership by adapting concepts from the self-leadership and transformational leadership theories. IT self-leadership refers to the ability to intentionally influence one's own thinking, feeling, and actions toward the use of IT to reach one's work and life goals. To increase IT self-leadership, students should try new technologies as much as possible. Instructors should set up norms about trying new technologies, troubleshooting one's own issues, and play a supportive and encouraging role, rather than employing directed-teaching methods. Findings: IT self-leadership skills are the ability to intentionally influence one's own thinking, feeling and actions towards the use of IT to reach one's work and life goals. The findings show that instructors' transformational IT leadership as well as students' innovativeness with IT contributes to students' IT self-leadership. Recommendations for Practitioners: Practitioners may consider exhibiting transformational IT leadership skills including: (1) giving encouragement about IT use; (2) fostering trust; (3) encouraging thinking about IT problems in new ways; (4) being clear about their values about IT by practicing what they preach in their IT use; and (5) inspiring students by being highly competent in IT. Potential ways that the instructors can exhibit these skills are discussed in the paper. Recommendation for Researchers: Researchers are recommended to include IT-self leadership of both students and instructors in their investigations on learning success. Furthermore, the inclusion of transformational IT leadership in new studies of teaching and learning success is recommended. Impact on Society: This paper includes students as part of the solution to challenges students face in online courses rather than treating them like passive recipients of educational changes. Thereby, it helps teachers and students to work together for a better solution to educational disruptions. Future Research: Studies should be conducted to determine other antecedents and outcomes of IT self-leadership. Research is needed on specific ways practitioners can increase their IT transformational leadership. While this paper introduced how the instructor of the exploratory study provided transformational IT leadership, more than one way of reaching each goal was practiced. Future research should test the connection between each transformational IT leadership behavior presented here and its outcome.

AB  - Learners of English as a new language and the teachers who find these young people in their classrooms face many challenges. For secondary science educators, this is often rooted in a general lack of professional development models for the design and implementation of science/language integrated instruction. To address this issue, the present study examines how participation in a paired professional development initiative with focus on multimodalities impacts teachers' pedagogical expertise in both language and science learning. We specifically examine the expert understandings and pedagogical skills developed by two teachers, one chemistry, one English to Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), who co-designed and co-taught science/language integrated lessons. Analysis of the pair's collaborative processes, resulting lessons, and their reflections on these reveals expertise gained in three main areas: attending to both content and language, seamless integration of multimodal technology, and formative assessment. Implications for the pairing of language and science educators along with roles and impacts of multimodal teaching strategies are discussed. Lastly, a language/content pairing model with emphasis on multimodal teaching strategies is recommended as an effective means for meeting the challenges of linguistically diverse science classrooms.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to provide other developing countries in the region a reference on the successful design education reformation in Taiwan. The study first reviews Taiwan's economic and design development to show their interconnection with local culture and the global market. Next, the study explores Taiwan's design education development which transforms from adopting STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) to STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, mathematics) in secondary school, and understands how it overcomes challenges by the help of both public and private sectors. Last, a conceptual framework is proposed to present and study Taiwan's design education development. The result from case studies validates that STEAM can reach SAD (science, arts, and design) in higher education and CHEER (collaboration, humanity, empathy, ecology, and renaissance) in design practice. Therefore, the result and implications provided by this study can serve as a reference for other countries in the region who share similar cultural and socioeconomic development and future goals as Taiwan.

AB  - We describe a third-year undergraduate course that focuses on multiscale modeling and protein folding and has as its primary goal the encouragement of students to integrate thinking across and beyond disciplinary boundaries. The ability to perform innovative and successful research work in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields is often dependent on being aware of the multiple connections between the sciences, but how to develop such an integrated perspective is rarely taught in college classes. Designed for STEM majors, the course combines laboratory sessions and lectures, assessed through student journals and oral presentations. We report on some of the activities we developed for this course and on the associated outcomes. A syllabus, an assessment, and interview questions, as well as examples of student responses, are provided as supplementary materials. The course topics discussed in this article include an analogy between desiccated corn starch and basaltic columns, a discussion of the size of trees, diffusion at the microscopic and macroscopic levels, and computational aspects of protein folding. Teaching materials, including handouts, experimental methods, and MATLAB codes, as well as student journals, are available from the course website.

AB  - Amid calls for integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (iSTEM) in K-12 education, there is a pressing need to uncover productive methods of integration. Prior research has shown that increasing contextual linkages between science and mathematics is associated with student problem solving and conceptual understanding. However, few studies explicitly test the benefits of specific instructional mechanisms for fostering such linkages. We test the effect of students developing a modeled process mathematical equation of a scientific phenomenon. Links between mathematical variables and processes within the equation and fundamental entities and processes of the scientific phenomenon are embedded within the equation. These connections are made explicit as students participate in model development. Pre-post gains are tested in students from diverse high school classrooms studying inheritance. Students taught using this instructional approach are contrasted against students in matched classrooms implementing more traditional instruction (Study 1) or prior traditional instruction from the same teachers (Study 2). Students given modeled process instruction improved more in their ability to solve complex mathematical problems compared to traditionally instructed students. These modeled process students also show increased conceptual understanding of mathematically modeled processes. The observed effects are not due to differences in instructional time or teacher effects.

AB  - We study the interconnection between Physics and Mathematics in concrete instances, departing from the usual expression for the Coulomb electric field, produced by a point-like charge. It is scrutinized by means of six epistemology-intensive questions and radical answers are proposed, intended to widen one's understanding of the subject. Our interventions act along two complementary directions. One of them regards ontology, since questions induce one to look closely at the electric charge, from different perspectives, promoting reflections about its nature and reinforcing the corresponding concept. Formal manipulations rely on the identification of concepts with symbols, and the other direction concerns the spatial extension of mathematical structures. Our questions and their somewhat unusual answers help disclosing information which is not present in many textbooks, and show that Mathematics can be used as an efficient epistemological tool in Physics teaching.

AB  - Despite calls for more attention to the preparation of those who prepare teachers, there have been few examples of institutionally sanctioned and structured learning opportunities created to equip faculty with the knowledge and skills necessary to become effective teacher educators. In this paper, we describe a cross-disciplinary and collaborative initiative that involves shadowing of colleagues as a means of supporting the professional learning of science teacher educators. We illustrate the unique affordance of this model and highlight our professional learning across multiple dimensions: cognitive, practical, relational, and emotional. We illustrate how shadowing can support the learning of faculty at different career stages and from different disciplinary backgrounds and entry points to teacher education through a series of vignettes of shadowing in a variety of course contexts. Finally, we offer considerations for the transferability of our model to other institutions and contexts, and how further research conducted in the context of shadowing could help deepen our understanding of the knowledge base of science teacher educators and how this knowledge is developed.

AB  - This article presents the author's response to the article "Taking Stock: Existing Resources for Assessing a New Vision of Science Learning" by Alonzo and Ke (this issue), which identifies numerous challenges that the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) pose for large-scale assessment. Jill Werthem comments that among those challenges is how to create assessments that reflect the vision of science literacy outlined in the Framework. She writes that Alonzo and Ke identify the following challenge as the most salient for assessment: "The Framework emphasizes that learning about science and engineering involves integration of the knowledge of scientific explanations (i.e., content knowledge) and the practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. (NRC, 2012, p. 11). Wertheim responds that while addressing this point, Alonzo and Ke raise important questions about the recommendation made in the 2014 National Research Council (NRC) report that items developed for NGSS might comprise sets of questions, each of which measures a single dimension of a three-dimensional performance expectation. Although unidimensionality has long been standard practice for high-quality assessment, the NGSS is pushing this standard to change for state science assessment (Gorin & Mislevy, 2013). Wertheim remarks that If assessments are to serve the purpose of monitoring progress toward the vision of science literacy outlined above, they must provide the kind of information that teachers and students need to guide improvement toward those goals (Black and Wiliam, 1998; NRC, 2001).

AB  - While middle school is a critical phase for science career development for all students (Maltese & Tai, 2009), this stage presents considerations for females in science, in particular. During middle school, the decline in science interest is greater for females than males and, for most students, the level of science interest developed during this middle school stage will persist throughout their lifetime, thereby influencing science career interests and attainment (Todd & Zvoch, 2017). This study aimed to stimulate and sustain middle school female students' interest in science study and careers by transforming opportunities for their participation in classroom science in ways that better appealed to and supported female science students. Research has shown that collaborative and active engagement with peers, hands-on and tangible modes of engagement, significant real-world connections, and choice have been effective in supporting middle school female students in science. Arts-integration has been explored as a cohesive framework that could potentially incorporate each of these characteristics into a science learning environment for five middle school female students. Pre- and post-interviews served as data to investigate the impact of a four-week arts-integrated science unit on the students' interests in science and science careers. The students explicitly discussed the positive effects of collaborative and active engagement with peers, hands-on and tangible modes of engagement, and significant real-world connections on their interest in science and science career planning. While they did not explicitly acknowledge choice, all of the girls indicated thorough enjoyment from learning and engaging in science in the ways presented in the study. All of the students advanced in their career planning as a result of experiences in the unit, either in terms of science careers or the arts. Findings are discussed in light of related research and future lines of inquiry.

AB  - Management information systems (MIS) programs were developed to prepare graduates to create innovative solutions to problems where business and technology intersect. As such, the curricula must change rapidly to stay current with industry standards, an accelerating moving target. This research presents the findings of a systematic literature review to identify and present trends in the scholarly literature on MIS education. The purpose of this approach was to understand how academia ensures students are prepared for industry and keeps pace with changing industry needs. Key findings from the literature are presented, as well as a compilation of areas for future research. Overwhelmingly, a lack of international perspective was identified as the vast majority of articles collected data in the US. Further, the direction of future research and exploration revolved around five themes of innovative pedagogical approaches, industry partnerships, subtopics of MIS education, new methods and metrics for measuring success in MIS education, and cross-disciplinary opportunities in fields such as mathematics, traditional business disciplines, and the hard sciences.

AB  - Children's literature provides elementary teachers and students the opportunity to critically engage in the world around them. However, too often teachers choose not to engage students in discussions of complex social issues out of a sense of fear or discomfort. In this paper, we explore the reflections of 11 teachers who chose to engage their students in discussions of three complex social issues: immigration, migration, and forced relocation. Specifically, we highlight the successes, challenges, and surprises teachers reported after completing a three-week long unit that integrated discussions of complex social issues with computer science and science. Findings suggest that despite teacher reservations, students are interested in talking about complex social issues and through engagement with children's literature are able to engage in thoughtful, personal, and critical conversation about these issues. Further, through discussing critical social issues, teachers and students were able to build the culturally responsive social-emotional skills essential for effective participation in a diverse democratic society.

AB  - The study and utilisation of pendulum motion has had immense scientific, cultural, horological, philosophical, and educational impact. The International Pendulum Project (IPP) is a collaborative research effort examining this impact, and demonstrating how historical studies of pendulum motion can assist teachers to improve science education by developing enriched curricular material, and by showing connections between pendulum studies and other parts of the school programme especially mathematics, social studies and music. The Project involves about forty researchers in sixteen countries plus a large number of participating school teachers. The pendulum is a universal topic in university mechanics courses, high school science subjects, and elementary school programmes, thus an enriched approach to its study can result in deepened science literacy across the whole educational spectrum. Such literacy will be manifest in a better appreciation of the part played by science in the development of society and culture.

AB  - Purpose: This article explores linkages and disjunctions between citizenship education and character education in England. Approach: The article undertakes a theoretical discussion of what both forms of education are and involve, and a historical overview of their development over the past twenty years, utilising a wide range of primary and secondary sources. Findings: Citizenship education programmes tend to place much greater emphasis than character education on the development of the necessary knowledge and skills that enable participation in political and democratic activities. The focus of character education is on personal ethics rather than public ethics, and the particular understanding of character education advanced by British politicians has been narrow and instrumental, linking the development of character with individual "success", especially in the jobs market. Research implications: Comparative research is now needed to examine the strengths and weaknesses of these two forms of education as they are delivered in other countries, and to explore the similarities and differences between the experiences of different countries. Practical implications: Policy-makers concerned to ensure that young people have the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes they need to engage in civic and political activity should focus on programmes of citizenship education rather than character education.

AB  - Purpose: Approaches to learning have the ability to influence knowledge acquisition, comprehension, retention and even motivation to learn. Previous work indicates that despite age, experience, or prior knowledge, students have a tendency to approach learning differently as a function of the presented content. The purpose of this study is to explore how context influences student approaches to learning science. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopt a question-asking methodology to evaluate if approaches to learning the same science content vary when presented within the context of Pure Science or the History of Science. Findings: Results indicate that contextualizing the presentation of science content, shifts the approaches students take in attempting to learn science content as evidenced by the questions they ask to deepen their understanding. Additional variables of prior experience with each scientific concept, task persistence at a distractor task and later recall of the presented concepts were related to different inquiry strategies. Research limitations/implications: Implications for instructional design and pedagogy are discussed. Practical implications: The framework in which scientific information is presented may impact how students modify existing and create a new schema, impacting their beliefs about scientific knowledge and the way in which students question, hypothesize and engage within the domain of science. Social implications: By studying the role of inquiry while students engage in science learning, the authors explore the role of context, content and knowledge retention. Originality/value: The current study probes at the nature of student questioning and its reliance on the content, context and its relationship to outcome variables such as learning and, perhaps, even persistence as it relates to students' prior knowledge within content areas which may, in turn, lead to varying levels of student self-efficacy.

AB  - For more than a century the notion of a pre-established harmony between the mathematical and physical sciences has played an important role not only in the rhetoric of mathematicians and theoretical physicists, but also as a doctrine guiding much of their research. Strongly mathematized branches of physics, such as the vortex theory of atoms popular in Victorian Britain, were not unknown in the nineteenth century, but it was only in the environment of fin-de-si√®cle Germany that the idea of a pre-established harmony really took off and became part of the mathematicians' ideology. Important historical figures were in this respect David Hilbert, Hermann Minkowski and, somewhat later, Albert Einstein. Roughly similar ideas can be found also among British theorists, among whom Arthur Eddington, Arthur Milne, and Paul Dirac are singled out. Although largely limited to the period 1870-1940, the paper also considers Max Tegmark's recent hypothesis of the universe (or multiverse) being a one-to-one reflection of mathematical structures.

AB  - Purpose: The main goal of this article is to learning define and justify group problem solving as an approach to citizenship education. It is demonstrated that the choice of theoretical framework of democracy has consequences for the chosen learning goals, educational approach and learning activities. The framework used here is an epistemic theory of deliberative democracy. It is argued that such an approach enhances teachers' and pupils' autonomy. Design/methodology/approach: First, it was discussed what kind of theory of democracy lies behind the mainstream approach to citizenship education. Then, it was demonstrated how a chosen theory of democracy and citizenship leads to a specific translation into educational principles. In order to define and translate the chosen framework into educational principles and learning activities, different disciplines were drawn upon: political philosophy, cognitive and educational psychology. Findings: Group problem solving was defined as an alternative participatory educational approach to citizenship education and four educational principles were defined: argumentation, connected learning, decision making and thinking together. Practical implications: Educationalists, policy makers and researchers working on citizenship education should discuss their ideals of democracy and citizenship in order for these to become an object of scrutiny in the curriculum.

AB  - Two common goals of science teacher professional development (PD) are increased content knowledge (CK) and improved readiness to teach through inquiry. However, PD assessment challenges arise when the context is structured around inquiry-based, participant-driven learning, and when the content crosses scientific disciplines. This study extended the use of concept mapping as an assessment tool for examining changes in the content knowledge of 21 high school science teachers who participated in a field-based environmental science summer institute. The scoring rubric focused on documenting concepts, links, and map organization and scope in an attempt to capture development of cross-disciplinary knowledge in ways that correspond with theories of expertise development. The analysis revealed significant gains from pre-PD to post PD maps in the sophistication of links between concepts and in the number of additional, participant-generated scientifically valid concepts. Relative to the initial maps, post PD maps also manifested more complete clustering of concepts. Findings are discussed in reference to previous studies on teachers' learning and implications for future research using concept mapping as a means of assessing teacher PD.

AB  - Twenty-first century and global skills are generally described as competencies for communication and problem solving. Additionally, these skills involve developing the ability to view content-specific issues through a multicultural perspective. Preparing K-12 students for STEM careers in an ever-changing workplace means they must have opportunities to concurrently acquire skills in twenty-first century and global learning. Additionally, the professional biology community has called for advancing middle grades students' knowledge of complex scientific phenomena using novel pedagogies like Project-Based Learning (PBL). Thus, middle grade educators are now tasked to design classroom opportunities for STEM-focused PBL using global interaction to hone global and twenty-first century skills, while developing students' content knowledge. In this article, we provide an account of a classroom-centered project that paired middle school students in Texas with Chinese peers to collaborate on a biology-based PBL activity on the topic of genetics. During the seven-day unit on heredity, the goal was to utilize global collaboration in STEM to achieve learning objectives in the biology curriculum (understanding inheritance and differentiating between dominant and recessive traits), while embedding skills that foster global competency and twenty-first century skills. The context, planning, and outcomes of the global collaboration are discussed, as well as recommendations for future global collaborative STEM initiatives in middle school.

AB  - Universities are undertaking transformation projects that align their work with the Sustainable Development Goals. This paper describes how Ocean I3, an educational innovation project that aims to reduce plastic in the sea, has made an impact on its community over its three editions (2018/19 to 2020/21). Methodologically, it has been approached by the people who make up the technical team and academic coordination as an exploratory study using discrete, non-reactive techniques, mainly from the public domain (websites, blogs, press releases, etc.), and instruments, such as field notes and work material to manage, organize, and train within the project. The analytical procedure has represented a dynamic and systematic process of categorisation. The results highlight the repercussion of the project in terms of capstone projects, master's thesis, coursework, etc., produced by the students involved; association with employability; collaborative work from the teaching teams; monitoring experience for research purposes, and social dissemination of the project. It concludes by suggesting lines for Ocean I3 to work on in the future to make its footprint sustainable in institutions over time.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the views of pre-service science teachers about STEM education. A two-hour Arduino based STEM learning activity was conducted for fifteen pre-service science teachers. Afterwards, the views of the participants were investigated by conducting an online survey consisting of open-ended questions. Finally, the obtained data were analysed with the content analysis technique using NVivo 12. As a result of the analysis, it was concluded that pre-service teachers do not know the content of the STEM approach but at the same time, they think that STEM education should be applied in schools, and they want to learn how STEM can be used in classes. Based on the results, it is suggested that it should be beneficial to provide professional development to pre-service teachers regarding the content of the STEM approach.

AB  - The history of innovation is constructed by solo thinkers and collaborative makers. The word innovation here comprises changes on technology, art and science. This article aims to reflect the way successful inventors, artists and scientists followed to do whatever they succeeded so that the coming generations can learn from predecessors' positive and negative experiences. Thinking and observing as solo may be the first step of an entrepreneur dreamer. Thinking and observation allow her to understand the size and depth of the gap on her knowledge integrity. This understanding process is a kind of challenge annoying and disturbing the entrepreneur dreamer during days and nights and causing his/ her to focus on the subject including examining the existing knowledge and experiences. Successful entrepreneur dreamers are aware of the historical knowledge accumulation on the field they focus on. After an entrepreneur dreamer understands what to do, on the second step, she starts tinkering collaboratively with other people whom the dreamer needs because of their own knowledge, experiences, point of view etc. With the help of others, entrepreneur starts the attempts to fill gap on his/her knowledge. These attempts require series of trial and error. First thinking and focusing on a subject as solo and then taking action and tinkering to realize dreams and thoughts as collaborative may lead us to a new learning design approach. "Soloborative Learning" is a derivative word offering the schools a new way to design learning environments, interactions and learning materials so that learners can construct their own knowledge on an innovative and entrepreneurial ecosystem.

AB  - The impact of developing technologies is also observed in educational environments where many digital content-based applications are used. When the studies conducted are examined, it is seen that the applications where digital content is presented to students constitute the majority. However, considering the 21st century skills, more is needed to give students high-level experiences. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of innovative application, which is applied by the students developing their own digital content within the English course, on their academic achievements, attitudes towards English lessons and attitudes towards computer-aided teaching. The study was carried out at the secondary school level. In the experimental group, a game-based application was made with Scratch, a block-based programming tool within the scope of English lessons. The control group continued its technology-supported education with its current technological infrastructure (interactive board with fiber internet access). The mixed method research design was used in the study. The academic achievement test developed for two different units as the quantitative data collection tool by the researcher, the Attitude Scale for Elementary English Lesson Developed by Bas (2012), and the Computer Assisted Instruction Evaluation Scale developed by Din√ßer and Doganay (2016) were used. In addition, semi-structured interview form was used as a qualitative data collection tool. As a result of the research, significant differences were seen in the academic success values of the experimental group, where innovative application was performed. When students' attitudes towards English lesson and their attitudes towards computer-aided education are examined, meaningful results are obtained in favor of the experimental group. As a result, the findings showed that, with the necessary preparations, the innovative application used in this study can benefit students' academic achievements, their attitudes towards English lessons and their attitudes towards computer-aided teaching.

AB  - Children with intellectual disabilities have difficulties in language acquisition and learning in general and therefore demands specialized and effective instructional strategies. For this reason, the purpose of this study was to examine effectiveness of integrating drawing, as a specialized instruction, in teaching English Language to children with intellectual disabilities. Quasi-experiment was employed with which pre-test and post-test of both control and experimental groups were analyzed. The results saw the experimental group performing better in the post-test results as compared to the control group, proving that integrating drawing in teaching English Language is an effective instructional strategy. Therefore, the researchers recommend that teachers and other educational implementers working with children with intellectual disabilities should consider integrating drawing in teaching and learning of English Language.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss the history of the concept of function and emphasize in particular how problems in physics have led to essential changes in its definition and application in mathematical practices. Euler defined a function as an analytic expression, whereas Dirichlet defined it as a variable that depends in an arbitrary manner on another variable. The change was required when mathematicians discovered that analytic expressions were not sufficient to represent physical phenomena such as the vibration of a string (Euler) and heat conduction (Fourier and Dirichlet). The introduction of generalized functions or distributions is shown to stem partly from the development of new theories of physics such as electrical engineering and quantum mechanics that led to the use of improper functions such as the delta function that demanded a proper foundation. We argue that the development of student understanding of mathematics and its nature is enhanced by embedding mathematical concepts and theories, within an explicit-reflective framework, into a rich historical context emphasizing its interaction with other disciplines such as physics. Students recognize and become engaged with meta-discursive rules governing mathematics. Mathematics teachers can thereby teach inquiry in mathematics as it occurs in the sciences, as mathematical practice aimed at obtaining new mathematical knowledge. We illustrate such a historical teaching and learning of mathematics within an explicit and reflective framework by two examples of student-directed, problem-oriented project work following the Roskilde Model, in which the connection to physics is explicit and provides a learning space where the nature of mathematics and mathematical practices are linked to natural science.

AB  - The main purpose of vocabulary instruction is to enhance and support reading comprehension. This goal spans across the grade levels and different disciplines and is supported by a plethora of research. In recent years, a great deal of needed attention has been finally given to academic vocabulary and disciplinary literacy. To contribute to this body of knowledge, we believe it is critical to examine how the complex relationship between vocabulary and comprehension may be addressed in secondary content area classrooms, given the unique nature of the academic vocabulary students encounter daily in school. This conceptual paper contains the following: (1) definition of academic vocabulary; (2) description of what is known about the vocabulary-comprehension relationship; (3) conceptualization of the intersection of academic vocabulary and the vocabulary-comprehension relationship; and (4) instructional implications emerging from this intersection. Perhaps this conceptualization may provide disciplinary practitioners more insight to help them make decisions regarding vocabulary instruction.

AB  - Purpose: In conjunction with curricular changes, a process to develop integrated examinations was implemented. Pre-established guidelines were provided favoring vignettes, clinically relevant material, and application of knowledge rather than simple recall. Questions were read aloud in a committee including all course directors, and a reviewer with National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) item writing and review experience. This study examines the effectiveness of this process to improve the quality of in-house examinations. Methods: Five hundred and twenty items were randomly selected from two academic years for initial comparison; 270 from 2000 to 2001, and 250 from 2001 to 2002. The first set of items represented the style, content and format when courses and tests were departmentally/discipline based, assembled by course directors, and administered separately. The latter group represented similar characteristics when courses and tests were organ-system-based, committee-reviewed and administered in an integrated examination. Items were randomized, blinded for year of origin, and rated by three NBME staff members with extensive item review experience. A five-point rating scale was used: one indicated a technically flawed item assessing recall of an isolated fact; five indicated a technically unflawed item assessing application of knowledge. To assess continued improvement, a follow-up set of 250 items from the 2002 to 2003 academic year was submitted to the same three reviewers who were not informed of the purpose or origin of this set of test items. Results: The mean rating for items from 2000 to 2001 was 2.51 plus or minus 1.27; analogous values for 2001-2002 were 3.16 plus or minus 1.33, (t = 5.83; p less than 0.0001), and in 2002-2003; 3.59 plus or minus 1.15 (t = 10.11; p less than 0.0001). Conclusion: Pre-established guidelines and an interdisciplinary review process resulted in improved item quality for in-house examinations.

AB  - We currently live in a high-tech society where portable supercomputers, artificial intelligence, genetic enhancement, etc., are becoming part of our daily life. It can be argued that this steady flow of complex technology is vigorously pushing aside religion and faith in God. Nowadays if a student decides to study physics he/she cannot possibly think of, nor have an interest in philosophy, let alone theology. This limited attitude towards physics is stripping it of its real meaning and purpose. This paper argues that physics is a study that God has put in the hands of humanity to be used in conjunction with philosophy and theology, in order not only to be able to ask "big questions" about nature and the universe, but also to actively contribute to finding some answers to them. Ideas about a scientific-philosophical-theological approach to teaching physics at the undergraduate level within a Catholic institution are presented and discussed.

AB  - This article establishes and addresses opportunities for ethics integration into Machine-learning (ML) courses. Following a survey of the history of computing ethics and the current need for ethical consideration within ML, we consider the current state of ML ethics education via an exploratory analysis of course syllabi in computing programs. The results reveal that though ethics is part of the overall educational landscape in these programs, it is not frequently a part of core technical ML courses. To help address this gap, we offer a preliminary framework, developed via a systematic literature review, of relevant ethics questions that should be addressed within an ML project. A pilot study with 85 students confirms that this framework helped them identify and articulate key ethical considerations within their ML projects. Building from this work, we also provide three example ML course modules that bring ethical thinking directly into learning core ML content. Collectively, this research demonstrates: (1) the need for ethics to be taught as integrated within ML coursework, (2) a structured set of questions useful for identifying and addressing potential issues within an ML project, and (3) novel course models that provide examples for how to practically teach ML ethics without sacrificing core course content. An additional by-product of this research is the collection and integration of recent publications in the emerging field of ML ethics education.

AB  - Epistemic Insight is a research and education initiative that is seeking to establish effective ways to help school students to appreciate the power and limitations of science. In particular, the idea is that experiences and explanations devised by a teacher who is focused on what happens inside the science classroom might not be interpreted as intended by students--who in turn are "generalists" moving from subject to subject and in and out of school.

AB  - A steward of the discipline was originally defined as "someone who will creatively generate new knowledge, critically conserve valuable and useful ideas, and responsibly transform those understandings through writing, teaching, and application". This construct was articulated to support and strengthen doctoral education. The purpose of this paper is to expand the construct of stewardship so that it can be applied to both scholars "and non-academic practitioners", and can be initiated earlier than doctoral education. To accomplish and justify this, we describe a general developmental trajectory supporting cross-curriculum teaching for stewardship of a discipline as well as of a profession. We argue that the most important features of stewardship, comprising the public trust for the future of their discipline or profession, are obtainable by all practitioners, and are not limited to those who have completed doctoral training. The developmental trajectory is defined using the Mastery Rubric construct, which requires articulating the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) to be targeted with a curriculum; recognizable stages of performance of these KSAs; and performance level descriptors of each KSA at each stage. Concrete KSAs of stewardship that can be taught and practiced throughout the career (professional or scholarly) were derived directly from the original definition. We used the European guild structure's stages of Novice, Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master for the trajectory, and through a consensus-based standard setting exercise, created performance level descriptors featuring development of Bloom's taxonometric cognitive abilities (see Appendix A) for each KSA. Together, these create the Mastery Rubric for Stewardship (MR-S). The MR-S articulates how stewardly behavior can be cultivated and documented for individuals in any disciplinary curriculum, whether research-intensive (preparing "scholars") or professional (preparing members of a profession or more generally for the work force). We qualitatively assess the validity of the MR-S by examining its applicability to, and concordance with professional practice standards in three diverse disciplinary examples: (1) History; (2) Statistics and Data Science; and (3) Neurosciences. These domains differ dramatically in terms of content and methodologies, but students in each discipline could either continue on to doctoral training and scholarship, "or" utilize doctoral or pre-doctoral training in other professions. The MR-S is highly aligned with the practice standards of all three of these domains, suggesting that stewardship can be meaningfully cultivated and utilized by those working in or outside of academia, supporting the initiation of stewardship prior to doctoral training and for "all" students, not only those who will earn PhDs or be scholars first and foremost. The MR-S can be used for curriculum development or revision in order to purposefully promote stewardship at all levels of higher education and beyond. The MR-S renders features of professional stewardship accessible to all practitioners, enabling formal and informal, as well as self-directed, development and refinement of a professional identity.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how students' engagement varies in different STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) learning environments. More specifically, we focus on the significance of a learning environment applying an integrated STEM (iSTEM) approach and the significance of STEM learning environments' student-centredness. Moreover, we explore the relative importance of different student-centred principles (lesson plan and implementation, communicative interactions, student-teacher relationships) for students' engagement in the STEM learning environment. Applying a mixed-method approach, we draw from observational data of 24 STEM lessons in combination with data from seven focus groups with 67 grade 9 students. The quantitative findings, based on the observational data, show that a learning environment applying an iSTEM approach seems to support students' engagement. Further investigation made it clear that the student-centredness in this learning environment is especially significant. Regarding the specific student-centred principles, all principles had a significant impact on students' engagement. The focus group data make clear that, besides student-centredness, the integrative aspect and the use of authentic real-world problems in iSTEM can also be engaging for students. These results indicate that iSTEM is a good practice to engage students in the STEM learning environment, as it facilitates teachers' implementation of a general student-centred approach.

AB  - This paper is an activity report that draws on the experience of embedding sustainability into the mainstream curriculum in the Language Centre, School of Languages, Cultures and Societies at the University of Leeds, UK. It describes and reflects on programmes that delivered the concept of sustainability and how learners developed their academic and sustainability literacies. The programmes in question are Language for Engineering and Language in Context Sustainability module. These programmes are developed and delivered in the context of English for Academic Purposes to pre-sessional postgraduate and undergraduate international students. The former programme prepares students for their postgraduate studies in the receiving schools, such as Engineering, Computer Science and Transport. The latter is an elective programme for a cross-discipline student cohort primarily to develop language specific to the concept of sustainability. Both programmes focus on expanding subject specific lexis and developing criticality skills. Positive student engagement and response¬†-- student feedback¬†-- is an effective indicator that there is a demand for programmes in the mainstream curriculum that promote sustainability literacies. It is time for sustainability to move from the margins and occupy its place at the forefront in language learning.

AB  - This study aims at determining the science concepts and subjects used in the "religion courses" taught in secondary schools and the contribution of science to religion courses, which is not a widely studied topic in the relevant literature. Like qualitative research, this study is a multiple case study. The data were collected using a semi-structured interview with five Muslim religion teachers working in an eastern city of Turkey. The interview data were analyzed using the basic descriptive and content analysis methods. The findings showed that religion teachers benefit from the concepts and subjects of science in their courses; using life sciences in their religion courses had a positive impact in teaching religious subjects better to the students; the use of the concepts of life sciences in religion courses enabled students to perceive the subject better; students enjoyed the use of science concepts in religion courses and also students asked questions to their teachers about many subjects of life sciences. Religion teachers expressed that they did not feel competent enough in the life sciences. Some recommendations, such as organizing in-service training have been made for religion teachers to feel competent enough in life sciences.

AB  - This paper situates a critical review of studies that we have conducted within the broader research literature to analyze the affordances of integrating modeling within disciplinarily-integrated games from computational thinking and science as practice perspectives. Across the studies, the analyses pursue two themes: (a) the role of agent-based modeling as a synergistic local practice around which we can integrate computational thinking and scientific modeling within digital games and (b) the role of collaboration in leveraging those synergies. We then present a design of a disciplinarily-integrated game that integrates these themes to demonstrate one such possible instantiation of the themes. Finally, we discuss the implications for design and praxis with a particular focus on learning in classrooms across the curriculum. Specifically, we first explore the implications in terms of connecting to teachers' views of practice by framing computational modeling and computational thinking as mathematization. We then explore the implications of shifting from a focus on single players to communities of practice in terms of computational participation as science as practice. We close by exploring the pragmatic and pedagogical affordances of shifting from stand-alone single-topic games to flexible agent-based environments in terms of student development across the curriculum.

AB  - Technological and social changes have left the medical profession without theory and content needed to adapt, making it essential to upgrade teaching of behavioral sciences in medical education. Despite their breadth and lack of definition relative to medical science, behavioral sciences provide a functional area that mediates between the patient as a person and the delivery of medical care.

AB  - It is one thing to produce an innovative, construct-based assessment task; it's another to produce 10 a year that are comparable in difficulty, measure the same competencies, are free of differential item functioning, and can be scaled and equated. These challenges contributed to the failure of the performance (or authentic) assessment movement of the 1990s to gain much traction for summative uses. Many of those performance assessments were innovative and construct relevant, but failed to meet some fundamental requirements, including efficiency (in terms of cost and time) and psychometric quality (particularly in terms of reliability/generalizability, and form-to-form comparability). How can replicating these problems in the new science assessments be avoided? As Alonzo and Ke (2016, see EJ1122509) suggest, new science assessments will be needed to satisfy the new science standards, but the authors of this commentary suggest that new architectures for these new assessments will probably also be needed. Herein they discuss the uses of assessments, using embedded assessments for certification, and propose linking embedded assessments to standard certification assessments.

AB  - Undergraduate public law courses often attract students with competing expectations. Some students enroll in these courses to prepare for law school, while others enroll in the courses to gain a broader understanding of courts in the American system of government. These differing student constituencies can create a dilemma for instructors. A course designed to cater to students with a general interest in the judiciary may not afford prelaw students with an appreciation for the demands of the legal profession. Conversely, a course narrowly tailored toward prelaw students risks alienating the majority of students for whom this class may be their only look at the judiciary. As a means to promote pedagogical balance and to appeal to varied student constituencies, we profile five public law simulations in this article that engage students in active learning and promote a greater understanding of law and courts.

AB  - A STEM methods course was developed for undergraduate preservice teachers at the faculty of education. The course model design had three phases: 1) review of the STEM literature and conceptual considerations, 2) planning of the STEM methods course, and 3) evaluation by experts and revision based on their feedback. Research literature and other documentation were reviewed. A framework and guiding principles for primary-level STEM education were developed to identify key elements, including STEM focus/essence, student-centered, curriculum, learning environment, and assessment. A 15-week STEM methods course was planned to model good practices for teaching integrated STEM and to let preservice teachers confront real-world issues and problems that arise in STEM instruction and then design their own STEM lessons or activities for teaching. The result of implementing the STEM methods course was examined through pre and post-surveys which showed the influence of the methods course in promoting preservice teachers' STEM understanding.

AB  - Recent studies emphasize the importance of learning science while considering multiple perspectives on environment, society, economy, and technology, which allows learners to relate what they do in the classroom to the world beyond. In this study, 68 12-year-old primary students from 1 Malaysian school were followed while they engaged in a science curriculum centered around 8 environment-related socio-scientific issues during a unit on the interaction among living things. The analysis shows that the informal reasoning skills of the students improved significantly. Progressive implementation of SSI activities encouraged students to use evidence-based decision-making, improving reasoning modes, and advancing reasoning levels.

AB  - This paper aims to provide a contribution to the research in physics education regarding the interplay between mathematics and physics in teaching and learning physics at the university level. The argument is developed through a study focused on the historical case study of the blackbody that led Planck to make one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs in physics: the introduction of discreteness and quantization into physical processes. The study is methodologically guided by the model that Udhen, Karam, Pietrocola, and Pospiech elaborated to highlight the interplay between physics and mathematics within teaching and learning practices [O. Uhden, R. Karam, M. Pietrocola, and G. Pospiech, Modelling mathematical reasoning in physics education, Sci. Educ. Netherlands 21, 485 (2012).]. The model emphasizes the distinction between the technical and structural roles of mathematics in physics, with the latter role being argued to correspond to processes of mathematization and interpretation. We used this model to analyze Planck's original papers and to reconstruct the reasoning that, thanks to the structural role played by mathematics, paved the way for the quantistic scientific breakthrough. The results of the analysis led us to design a teaching tutorial that we implemented with mathematics and physics university students. Students' reactions are reported to discuss the educational potential of the approach beyond the specific case and to argue for its potential general application to other similar physics topics.

AB  - Promoting and sustaining effective discussion--that which contributes to learning--is a skill that eludes many instructors (Darling-Hammond, 2008; Ge, Yamashiro, & Lee, 2000). This study explored the role and strategies of an expert instructor in an online advanced instructional design (ID) course that utilized a case-based learning (CBL) approach. Discussion posts, as well as interview data, were analyzed and coded to explore how the instructor utilized three strategies noted as being critical to students' learning during problem-centered discussions: social congruence, cognitive congruence, and content expertise (Schmidt & Moust, 1995; Yew & Yong, 2014). Results showed that facilitation choices were made with course goals in mind: modeling the case analysis process and improving students' ID problem solving. All three strategies were used frequently during discussion facilitation. Strategies tended to be implemented in clusters, with social congruence strategies appearing in every post but four. Implications are discussed for utilizing a combination of these facilitation strategies, in a dynamic manner, within a case-based context.

AB  - This paper highlights an investigation of how middle school students responded to a theatre performance designed to portray science as a humanistic and relatable endeavour that youth -- similar to the youth in the audience -- engage in during their everyday lives. The play included in this study was generated as a part of a design research project with a collaborative community comprised of artists, scientists, educators, and researchers. The design and implementation of this cross-disciplinary intervention and the research included in this study represent the design team's initial attempts to better understand youths' response to dramatic productions, and specifically which characters' practices youth 'count' as scientific. The design and goals of the project are described, followed by an analysis of focus group interviews with students (N = 65), which were conducted after watching the play. Despite the design team's intentions, findings highlight that the majority of students included in this study recognised a narrow range of practices taking place in the play as scientific, which led to a process of re-examination, complication, and interrogation the findings and design. Guided by Butler's theory of performativity, this paper is used as a reflection space in order to theorise this work in a new direction.

AB  - This descriptive case study examined student attitudes, writing skills and content knowledge of urban fourth and fifth graders (6 males, 9 female) during a six-week literacy, thinking skill, and art-integrated environmental science unit. Pre- and post-test questions were used to address knowledge of environmental problems and student environmental actions. Students expressed knowledge and suggestions for positive action of youth through four essays throughout the unit, the final essay being accompanied by a pop-up construction. Writings showed steady growth in number of words, sentences, suggested environmental actions for youth, and instances of discussing consequences and sequels of actions. Students were engaged, collaborative, and reported implementing positive environmental actions.

AB  - Training future leaders to understand life cycle assessment data is critical for effective research, business, and sociopolitical decision-making. However, the technical nature of these life cycle reports often makes them challenging for students and other nonexperts to comprehend. Therefore, we outline here the key takeaways from recent economic and life cycle assessments for three major commodity chemicals--ethylene, ethylene oxide, and terephthalic acid--that are precursors for plastics, synthetic fibers, and many other consumer products. The five lessons and 10 discussion prompts (provided in the Supporting Information) serve as useful teaching tools for introductory chemistry and chemical engineering courses.

AB  - The article studies theoretical issues of modern anthropocentric paradigm of scientific knowledge from the history of anthropocentric linguistics development as a special field of language science. The purpose of this study is to answer the question about human influence on the semiotic system. The material result is the unification of specific approaches to anthropological linguistics subject. Therefore, approach based on linguistics solved the problem of establishment of the human's linguistic nature, his language world. Conversely, the anthropocentric approach is focused on the person as a subject of speech activity that implements his communicative intentions in certain speech acts oriented to the world of semantics and mental human activities. Offered situations are examined on the actual material of the Russian language, which was analyzed from the standpoint of cognitive semantics. The problematics of anthropological linguistics, therefore, is not new and there are no sufficient grounds to consider it firmly established and generally accepted direction; only obvious trends are outlined, therefore it is better to talk about it as a linguistic paradigm having its own background in linguistics and closely related to other related sciences' issues.

AB  - There is increasing recognition of multiprofessional learning in anatomy and its role in medical and healthcare professions. This study utilized two components to investigate anatomy interprofessional education (AIPE) in the United Kingdom and Ireland. First, a survey involving qualitative and quantitative components asked Heads of Anatomy to report on their institutions' uptake of AIPE. Second, a series of case studies explored the experiences of students by using evaluation forms and an in-depth analysis of thematic concepts to understand the learners' perspectives on designing and delivering AIPE. Out of the 13 institutions that took part in the survey, eight did not offer an AIPE program. Between the remaining five institutions that deliver AIPE programs, 10 different modules are offered with the majority involving healthcare professions. The AIPE component is rated highly by students. The themes from the case studies highlight how valuable AIPE is from the student perspective both in terms of engaging them in anatomy as well as in the broader skills of teamwork and communication. The case studies also revealed how AIPE can be engaging for groups of students who might not have previously had access to cadaveric anatomy, for example, engineers and archeologists. The results of this study have implications for curriculum design in medicine and healthcare but also for further engagement of professional groups from non-healthcare backgrounds.

AB  - Students in senior pre-university education encounter difficulties in the application of mathematics into physics. This paper presents the outcome of an explorative qualitative study of teachers' beliefs about improving the transfer of algebraic skills from mathematics into physics. We interviewed 10 mathematics and 10 physics teachers using a semi-structured questionnaire that was based on an algebraic transfer problem. Almost all teachers acknowledged this transfer problem and considered it to be important. We found a continuum of teachers' beliefs about aspects influencing transfer, including beliefs on improving this transfer. Together with identified improvement aspects about coherent mathematics education, these may help reduce physics teachers' frustrations who spend extra time on re-teaching mathematics. Teachers think that transfer does not happen, because students see both subjects as separate disciplines. Contrary to most physics teachers, most mathematics teachers do not feel the need to collaborate with physics teachers. We found two extreme, opposite beliefs about the transfer of algebraic skills into physics. An intermediate group believes that only an integrated approach can solve the transfer problem. Some of the teachers' beliefs could be organised into a beliefs system. Further research could investigate to which extent such beliefs systems exist and which beliefs these contain.

AB  - We report on research that explores students' literacy practices in six Norwegian primary school science classrooms during integrated science-literacy instruction. The study combines observational video data and interview data to examine students' encounters with and use of text, along with their views and experiences related to science and science text. Drawing on New Literacy Studies perspectives--seeing literacy as a situated social practice--our analysis reveals how multiple literacies emerged in the context of integrated science-literacy instruction, where elements of students' informal literacies became valued resources in the dialogic process of inquiry. More specifically, the students engaged in literacy practices that transcended the contexts of science and school science to incorporate texts and literacy practices from the students' everyday lives as well as practices that were confined to a school-only context. On the basis of their talk about text in the classroom and data from focus group interviews, we also identify some of the challenges that these students faced in their encounters with science texts in this setting.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: The digital divide and educational inequalities remain a significant societal problem in the United States, and elsewhere, impacting low income, first-generation, and minority learners. Accordingly, institutions of higher education are challenged to meet the needs of students with varying levels of technological readiness with deficiencies in information and digital literacy shown to be a hindrance to student success. This paper documents the efforts of a mid-Atlantic minority-serving institution as it seeks to assess, and address, the digital and information literacy skills of underserved students. Background: A number of years ago, a historically Black university in Maryland developed an institutional commitment to the digital and information literacy of their students. These efforts have included adoption of an international certification exam used as a placement test for incoming freshmen; creation of a Center for Student Technology Certification and Training; course redesign, pre and post testing in computer applications courses; and a student perception survey. Methodology: A multi-methodological approach was applied in this study which relied on survey results, pre and post testing of students enrolled in introductory and intermediate computer applications courses, and scores from five years of placement testing. Student pre and post test scores were compared in order to examine degree of change, and post test scores were also assessed against five years of scores from the same test used as a placement for incoming freshmen. Finally, a student perception and satisfaction survey was administered to all students enrolled in the courses under consideration. The survey included a combination of dichotomous, Likert-scaled, and ranking questions and was administered electronically. The data was subsequently exported to Microsoft Excel and SPSS where descriptive statistical analyses were conducted. Contribution: This study provides research on a population (first-generation minority college students) that is expanding in numbers in higher education and that the literature reports as being under-prepared for academic success. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of current studies examining the information and technological readiness of students specifically enrolled at minority serving institutions. As such, this paper is timely and relevant and helps to extend our discourse on the digital divide and technological readiness as it impacts higher education. The students included in this study are representative of those enrolled in Historically Black Colleges or Universities (HBCUs) in the United States, giving this paper broad implications across the country. Internationally, most countries have populations of first-generation college students from under-served populations for whom a lack of digital readiness is an also an issue therefore giving this study a global relevance. Findings: The digital divide is a serious concern for higher education, especially as schools seek to increasingly reach out to underserved populations. In particular, the results of this study show that students attending a minority serving institution do not come to college with the technology skills needed for academic success. Pre and post testing of students, as well as responses to survey questions, have proven the efficacy of computer applications courses at building the technology skills of students. These courses are viewed overwhelmingly positive by students with respondents reporting that they are a necessary part of the college experience that benefits them academically and professionally. Use of an online simulated learning and assessment system with immediate automated feedback and remediation was also found to be particularly effective at building the computer and information literacy skills of students. The total sample size for this study was over 2,800 individuals as data from 2690 IC3 tests administered over a five year period were considered, as well as 160 completed surveys, and pre and post testing of 103 students. Recommendations for Practitioners: Institutions of higher education should invest in a thorough examination of the information and technology literacy skills, needs, and perceptions of students both coming into the institution as well as following course completion. Recommendation for Researchers: This research should be expanded to more minority serving institutions across the United States as well as abroad. This particular research protocol is easily replicated and can be duplicated at both minority and majority serving institutions enabling greater comparisons across groups. Impact on Society: The results of this research help to shed light on a problem that desperately needs to be addressed by institutions of higher education, which is the realities of the digital divide and the under preparedness of entering college students in particular those who are from low income, first generation, and minority groups. Future Research: A detailed quantitative survey study is being conducted that seeks to examine the technology uses, backgrounds, needs, interests, career goals, and professional expectations with respect to a range of currently relevant technologies.

AB  - Integrated STEM education leverages interconnections between science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in order to reflect upon how each discipline operates within real world contexts. Students benefit from the integrated STEM approach because it values the real-life experiences of students along with the hands-on applications that mirror professional STEM work. Nevertheless, integrated STEM instruction remains ill-defined with many gaps evident in the existing research of how implementation explicitly works. The school setting central to this case study was a suburban public middle school that had sustained an integrated STEM program for a period of over 5¬†years. Through the use of phenomenological qualitative inquiry, we focused on both teachers' and students' experiences of participation in one integrated STEM model. Three major themes emerged as part of this inquiry. First, teachers engaged in continual reflection that along with district supports contributed to the durability of the model. Second, teachers and student engaged in dynamic learning transactions based on the particular task and concept covered. Third, science projects anchored learning opportunities deemed most successful by participants.

AB  - Purpose: To contribute for the ongoing discussion about associations between art education and citizenship education, presenting Augusto Boal's Theatre of the Oppressed, as a theatre method that exercises active democracy by means of promoting epistemological development merging Art, Citizenship and Education. Design: Drawing form a selected set of relevant concepts and data in the fields of psychology, education, arts and performance studies, amongst others, the advantages and limitations of the artistic practice of theatre are analyzed in terms of its impact in epistemological and socio-cognitive development. Findings: A literature review shows several studies that evidence the benefits of artistic practices, namely theatre, in several indicators. Despite these evidences formal educative contexts, rooted in traditional pedagogic paradigms, resist to the entrance of arts, such as the performative, in school curricula, as well as other interactive practices indispensable in the promotion of participative citizenship. Research implications: Present existing methods alternative to formal education, exemplified by the method of the theatre of the oppressed, that aim to develop art, education and citizenship in one same practice. Practical implications: Evidence the need to reconsider formal education curricula with the objective of enhancing epistemological development, empowerment, autonomy and active citizenship.

In using the principles of hip-hop as a CSP for design, the authors question how and what practices were supported or emerged and how they became resources for youth engagement in the space. Design/methodology/approach: The overall methodology was design research. Through interpretive analysis, it uses an example of four Black girls participating in the camp as they build a computer-controlled DJ battle station. Findings: Through a close examination of youth interactions in the designed environment -- looking at their communication, spatial arrangements, choices and uses of materials and tools during collaborative project work -- the authors show how a learning ecology, designed based on hip-hop and computational practices and shaped by the history and practices of the dance center where the program was held, provided access to ideational, relational, spatial and material resources that became relevant to learning through computational making. The authors also show how youth engagement in the hip-hop computational making learning ecology allowed practices to emerge that led to expansive learning experiences that redefine what it means to engage in computing. Research limitations/implications: Implications include how such ecologies might arrange relations of ideas, tools, materials, space and people to support learning and positive identity development. Originality/value: Supporting culturally sustaining computational STEM pedagogies, the article argues two original points in informal youth learning (1) an expanded definition of computing based on making grammars and the cultural practices of hip-hop, and (2) attention to cultural ecologies in designing and understanding computational STEM learning environments.

AB  - In the context of research universities, what kind of places and spaces can we create for ourselves that foster a holistic vision of learning and community, a vision that is responsive to the shifting social and ecological landscapes of the Anthropocene? How can these spaces simultaneously address the need to nurture both personal and cultural change? How do the frames we create enhance or limit our place-making? This paper offers one situated response to such questions as it theorizes and describes the arts integrated emergence of the Centre for Place and Sustainability Studies at Lakehead University. Drawing from critical cultural and ecological studies, we problematize creating spaces in both centers and margins, and offer an arts integrated vision of a space for diverse and evolving approaches to sustainability work: a meeting ground characterized by a commitment to parallax and embodied aesthetic wholeness.

AB  - Despite the impetus from professional organizations for science and mathematics integration, few teacher training programs provide opportunities for teachers to develop the knowledge and skills in effective content integration. This study reports on the impact of a graduate course on in-service middle school, math, and science teachers' professional knowledge for content integration and their integration practice. This course model draws on the extant research on science and mathematics integration. Quantitative and qualitative results suggest the course increased teacher professional knowledge and improved integration practice. Integration practice was evaluated utilizing a project-based measure: the Mathematics and Science Integration Rubric (MASIR). Results indicate that although the integration practice and teacher conceptions of integration moved toward a more coherent application of integrated instruction, the combination of content knowledge and teacher feedback should be targets of extended professional learning. Implications for broader professional development issues for science and mathematics teachers are discussed.

AB  - One STEAM (STEM + Arts) strategy is to supplement traditional STEM instruction with music. Using music could provide the dual benefits of (1) making STEM content more accessible and (2) enhancing students' engagement in the learning process. Here we explore the extent to which music-oriented high school students achieve these two benefits when they participate in 'Songwriting To Learn', a possible variation on the Writing To Learn (WTL) model of instruction. We analysed 81 artist statements, collected over 12 years at an annual science fair, in which students described their music compositions and the compositions' connections to science. Rather than simply reporting scientific facts in song lyrics, these students used an impressive variety of musical elements (Genre, Instruments, Lyrics, and Structure [i.e. chords, dynamics, melody, rhythm]) as metaphors or symbols for science-related elements (Scientific Topic, Conveying Information, Affect, Personal Story, Scientific Story). Many students demonstrated a sophisticated attention to musical details and nuances, consistent with their frequent self-identification as musicians and/or music fans. Moreover, in composing and performing songs, these students fulfilled some of the key criteria by which scientific identities are developed, including the forging of personal connections to science. By writing songs about science, students may use their practice-linked identities in the domain of music to express their growing understanding in the domain of science.

AB  - Interprofessional teams in health care are showing promise in achieving the triple aim--providing better care for the individual patient, reducing costs, and improving population health. To complement current changes in health care delivery in the United States, there is a growing consensus among health professions educators that students should be trained in interprofessional models prior to entering clinical practice. Current interprofessional education (IPE) efforts in anatomy education are producing positive results in enhancing professional respect, collaboration, and teamwork among health professions students. In spite of existing structural and cultural barriers to IPE, health professions educators must continue to lead and grow IPE efforts as a critical component to improving the health of our nation.

AB  - Interprofessional education (IPE) is on today's agenda in medical education as a response to advances in medicine, the changes that have taken place in healthcare delivery, and pressures from the public and the profession. Although attention has focused on IPE in the later stages of the education program, there are benefits to be gained from the introduction of IPE in the early years. Curriculum developments supporting this include the adoption of outcome-based education and vertical integration. There is also a recognition that students' attitudes and biases are formed early in their education and the appropriate learning environment in the early years is important. Interprofessional education in the early years can also be seen as a part of a more general trend to greater collaboration in the delivery of an education program in the healthcare professions. Anatomy by incorporating IPE can help shape the future of medical education as well as being shaped by it. The possibility of success or failure with IPE can be captured with the equation IPE?=?(V √ó I)/N, where V?=?the IPE vision, I?=?the implementation strategy and N?=?negative perceptions of the approach. Success is more likely where there is a well thought out and shared vision for what is to be achieved, an appropriate implementation strategy and a plan to counteract a negative mind-set.

AB  - In physics education, equations are commonly seen as calculation tools to solve problems or as concise descriptions of experimental regularities. In physical science, however, equations often play a much more important role associated with the formulation of theories to provide explanations for physical phenomena. In order to overcome this inconsistency, one crucial step is to improve physics teacher education. In this work, we describe the structure of a course that was given to physics teacher students at the end of their master's degree in two European universities. The course had two main goals: (1) To investigate the complex interplay between physics and mathematics from a historical and philosophical perspective and (2) To expand students' repertoire of explanations regarding possible ways to derive certain school-relevant equations. A qualitative analysis on a case study basis was conducted to investigate the learning outcomes of the course. Here, we focus on the comparative analysis of two students who had considerably different views of the math-physics interplay in the beginning of the course. Our general results point to important changes on some of the students' views on the role of mathematics in physics, an increase in the participants' awareness of the difficulties faced by learners to understand physics equations and a broadening in the students' repertoire to answer "Why?" questions formulated to equations. Based on this analysis, further implications for physics teacher education are derived.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: This paper presents the preliminary findings of a pilot survey that sought to examine the technology uses, backgrounds, needs, interests, career goals, and professional expectations of Generation Z students enrolled at a minority serving institution in the United States Mid-Atlantic region. Background: Students entering college today are part of Generation Z born in the late 90's through 2016. Known for their short attention spans and heightened ability to multi-task, they already outnumber millennials and are the first true digital natives born during the age of smart phone. Methodology: In the fall of 2017, an online student perception survey was piloted with students enrolled at a mid-Atlantic minority-serving institution. The survey included a combination of dichotomous, Likert-scaled, and ranking questions. The survey was administered electronically using the Survey Monkey system to students following completion of core computer concepts courses and explored their technology backgrounds, skills, perceived computing self-efficacy, and the role they predict technology will play in their future career. The data was subsequently exported to Microsoft Excel and SPSS where descriptive statistical analyses were conducted. Contribution: As Generation Z descends on college campuses, with their technology dominated backgrounds and different communications, learning, and social preferences, it is important to better understand this generation whose needs and expectations will help shape the future of higher education. Additionally, this study also provides research on a population (first-generation minority college students) that is expanding in numbers in higher education and that the literature, reports is impacted negatively by the digital divide and educational inequalities. This paper is timely and relevant and helps to extend our understanding of Generation Z. Findings: The findings show that Generation Z learners enrolled in a minority-serving institution enjoy computer classes, feel that using computers comes easy to them; and perceive themselves as experts in the use of social media, mobile operating systems, using a smart phone, searching the Web, and email. Participants also reported that they want to be more technologically literate, want to be more skilled in computer software applications, and are interested in learning about cyber security. In terms of the future, most respondents also believe that their career will require them to analyze information to inform decision making. Additionally, most stated that information security will be important to their future career. Finally, the results affirmed that college computing courses remain important and that college students recognize that technology will play a crucial role in their career with employers wanting to see job applicants with strong technology skills. Recommendations for Practitioners: Generation Z learners enrolled in higher education need, and want, a wide range of technology courses available to them in order to help them meet the rapidly evolving demands of tomorrow's workplace. Students in this study overwhelmingly see the value in enhancing their technology skills especially in such areas as computer software applications, information management, and cyber security. Recommendation for Researchers: Institutions of higher education should invest in thorough and ongoing examinations of the information and technology literacy skills, needs, and perceptions of students. Impact on Society: Understanding the interests and needs of Generation Z learners is imperative to the future of higher education. Future Research: This survey is a work in progress that is part of a pilot study that is being used to help guide a much more sizable examination of Generation Z learners.

AB  - Computational thinking can provide a basis for problem solving, for making evidence-based decisions, and for learning to code or create programs. Therefore, it is critical that all students across the K-12 continuum--including students in the early grades--have opportunities to begin developing problem solving and computational thinking skills. Although computational thinking is central to computer science, CT skills, such as "abstraction", "problem decomposition", "algorithmic thinking", "pattern recognition", and "debugging" cut across multiple disciplines, promoting seamless integration in science and engineering (Wing 2016). Engineering design can be a context and approach for fostering computational thinking in formal and informal settings for elementary-age children. Through such learning experiences children can develop 21st-century skills vital for success in STEM+CT (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, computer science) careers. In this article, the authors share an engineering design activity that we employed to engage kindergarten to second-grade students in STEM+CT.

AB  - Edgar Allan Poe's standing as a literary figure, who drew on (and sometimes dabbled in) the scientific debates of his time, makes him an intriguing character for any exploration of the historical interrelationship between science, literature and philosophy. His sprawling "prose-poem" "Eureka" (1848), in particular, has sometimes been scrutinized for anticipations of later scientific developments. By contrast, the present paper argues that it should be understood as a contribution to the raging debates about scientific methodology at the time. This methodological interest, which is echoed in Poe's "tales of ratiocination", gives rise to a proposed new mode of--broadly abductive--inference, which Poe attributes to the hybrid figure of the "poet-mathematician". Without creative imagination and intuition, Science would necessarily remain incomplete, "even by its own standards". This concern with imaginative (abductive) inference ties in nicely with his coherentism, which grants pride of place to the twin virtues of Simplicity and Consistency, which must constrain imagination lest it degenerate into mere fancy.

AB  - The article addresses the problem of defining and attributing pedagogic essence to the mechanisms of personality identity development. It is based on the general mechanism of social interaction. Its structure contains, on the one hand, pedagogic interaction, including the forms of pedagogic assistance and pedagogic support; on the other hand, it also contains such components as impulse, perception, manipulation and conclusion (according to G.H. Mead). As a result, with regard to the pedagogic context with specified scientific-methodic supply, we explore local mechanisms of development (stimulating, teaching) of reflection and reflective behavior; acceptance of the Other's role; learning the choice and facilitating a motivated reasonable choice. We review the developmental potential of pedagogics of game, theatrical pedagogics, communicative attack technique, reflective teaching and mentoring, pedagogic support of empathy development, etc., for personality identity development.

AB  - There has been increased attention paid to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics also known as STEM. The focus on STEM has been both educational and occupational. Unfortunately, students with disabilities perform below their peers without disabilities in math and science. The authors discuss issues related to STEM and students with disabilities. These issues include (1) traditional views of STEM education, (2) the importance of STEM education, and (3) students with disabilities performance in STEM. The authors posit a framework for STEM education for students with disabilities and promote the incorporation of the arts to increase students' STEM knowledge and achievement.

We present a recently developed novel graduate course, which trains students in outreach efforts aimed to increase the public's understanding of science and of the role of science in our daily lives. In this course, the students, with the help of expert faculty mentors, prepare lay-language presentations about science-related topics of their choice and take the presentations to adult venues in the community. This article provides a detailed description of the course and its impact on the students and the audiences, and it discusses challenges encountered and lessons learned that will support others interested in attempting such a program.

AB  - In keeping with the scientific ideals and goals of actual practice, the concept of scientific literacy that drives the national science standards for elementary and middle school students also focuses on the process of science: observing, inferring, describing, asking questions, constructing explanations, and communicating ideas to others ("National Science Education Standards", 1996). In addition, the national standards emphasize the importance of social discourse within the classroom community and state that the ability to communicate a problem and design a solution, whether by oral, written, or pictorial means, is integral to scientific literacy. In this article, the authors discuss the value and importance of integrating writing into science classes, and the connections between science and poetry. They state that writing in science classes teaches students the language of science and how to engage in and guide scientific inquiry. They also state that writing poetry helps develop children's facility with figurative language, a precursor to the abstract thinking necessary for success in science. It also helps children to develop voice in their written work, a step toward writing like a scientist. The collaborative work that can be involved in writing poetry helps children function as "problem solvers rather than information receivers". (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - What can we learn from K-5 science teachers who have integrated science and creative dance for a five-year period? In this paper, the preliminary findings of the qualitative research conducted by a constructivist elementary charter school principal, a university dance professor, and an educational researcher is presented.This research highlights the experiences of science teachers who were given professional development in science/creative dance integration each semester and implemented arts integration strategies in the science classroom. To conclude the five-year period, the six teachers completed a questionnaire and participated in a videotaped interview to document their reflections on the project, Dance of Science Project (DoS), which serves as the primary data source for this paper. An interpretive methodology is used as a framework for interpreting the interviews of the teachers. Of interest is how teachers developed arts integration practices on their own in the classroom without being in partnership with a dance educator, and how arts integration in the science class supported their constructivist teaching practices which include elements of co-operation, autonomy, experimentation, play, and interest. In addition, the article discusses how creative dance aligns with the elements of constructivism.

AB  - This study examined the effectiveness of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics) integrated approach via Scratch on five subconstructs of computational thinking (CT) among 29 male and 30 female students. A quasi-experimental design was employed in the research. The participants demonstrated the application of CT in designing games via Scratch during the intervention. The Computational Thinking Survey (CTS) was administered pre-CT and post- CT tests in measuring the five subconstructs of CT. Repeated multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) results showed that the intervention positively affected male and female students' comprehension concerning the five subconstructs of CT. The results were strengthened by the repeated measure of analysis of variance (ANOVA) with posthoc comparisons, indicating all five subconstructs of CT increased significantly (p < 0.05). Indirectly, this research introduced a new teaching methodology for students' CT level in the current electronic and technology-advanced era and increased concept manipulation capacity among male and female students.

AB  - The University of Connecticut (UConn) is a public Carnegie Foundation Research institution with 14 schools and colleges that enrolls more than 18,000 undergraduate students at the main campus in Storrs, CT. Beginning in 1999, First-Year Experience (FYE) seminars were offered to entering freshman students. Since that time, the size of the program and the number of entering freshman who participate has increased. In conjunction with FYE classes, residential and non-residential learning communities (LC) were developed to create community within a broad interest area or within a discipline. One of these, the Animal Science LC, is open to all Animal Science majors and for the last 15 years has been led by the same faculty member. Students enrolled in the Animal Science LC complete a FYE seminar that can be clustered with 3 or 4 other courses to accomplish a sense of belonging among a cohort of majors, enhanced peer mentoring support, and sustained faculty-student interaction. A review of data has shown that over the last 10 years, students who participated in the Animal Science LC were more likely to persist in the Animal Science major, and they were more likely to graduate within 4 years.

AB  - The purpose of this report is to describe student satisfaction with a near-peer interprofessional education (IPE) session for physical therapy and medical students. Ten senior physical therapy students worked in peer-groups to develop a musculoskeletal anatomy demonstration for first-semester medical students. Together with their classmates, they demonstrated observation, palpation, and musculoskeletal assessment of the shoulder and scapular-thoracic articulation to medical student dissection groups in the Gross Anatomy laboratory. The medical students were encouraged to consider the synergistic function of shoulder structures and the potential impact of a selected pathology: rotator cuff injury. The session provided the medical students with an opportunity to integrate their new anatomical knowledge into a framework for clinical musculoskeletal evaluation. The experience offered senior physical therapy students an opportunity to work in teams with their peers, internalize and adapt to constructive feedback, and seek common ground with members of another profession. Both student groups reported a high degree of satisfaction with the sessions and expressed a desire for further interaction. These positive perceptions by student stakeholders have prompted us to consider additional IPE exchanges for the anatomy course in the upcoming school year. Given the positive outcome of this descriptive study, we now plan to systematically test whether near-peer IPE interactions can enhance the degree that students learn key anatomical concepts.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: Our research focuses on a unique group of students who study computer science (CS): ultra-orthodox Jewish men. Their previous education is based mostly on studying Talmud and hence they lacked a conventional high-school education. Our research goal was to examine whether their prior education is merely a barrier to their CS studies or whether it can be recruited to leverage academic learning. Background: This work is in line with the growing interest in extending the diversity of students studying computer science (CS). Methodology: We employed a mixed-methods approach. We compared the scores in CS courses of two groups of students who started their studies in the same college in 2015: 58 ultraorthodox men and 139 men with a conventional background of Israeli K-12 schooling. We also traced the solution processes of ultraorthodox men in tasks involving Logic, in which their group scored significantly better than the other group. Contribution: The main contribution of this work lies in challenging the idea that the knowledge of unique cultures is merely a barrier and in illustrating the importance of further mapping such knowledge. Findings: The ultraorthodox group's grades in the courses never fell below the grades of the other group for the duration of the five semesters. Due to their intensive Talmud studies (which embeds Logic), we hypothesized they would have leverage in subjects relating to Logic; however this hypothesis was refuted. Nevertheless, we found that the ultraorthodox students tended to recruit conceptual knowledge rather than merely recalling a procedure to solve the task, as novices often do. Recommendations for Practitioners: We concluded that these students' unique knowledge should not be viewed merely as a barrier. Rather, it can and should be considered in terms of what and how it can anchor and leverage learning; this could facilitate the education of this unique population. Impact on Society: This conclusion has an important implication, given the growing interest in diversifying higher education and CS in particular, to include representatives of groups in society that come from different, unique cultures. Future Research: Students' unique previous knowledge can and should be mapped, not only to foresee weaknesses that are an outcome of "fragile knowledge," but also in terms of possible strengths, knowledge, values, and practices that can be used to anchor and expand the new knowledge.

AB  - Most plants are able to obtain all of the nutrients that they need from air, water, and soil; however, this is not true of carnivorous plants. Because they tend to live in boggy soils where there are small amounts of nitrogen, carnivorous plants have developed specialized structures that enable them to lure and capture insects and sometimes other small animals (ICPS 2015). Because Venus flytraps, pitcher plants, and sundews are all native to their state (North Carolina) and use different structures to capture their prey, the authors chose those as their focus. Studying the natural world can be fascinating for young learners and can provide an opportunity for teachers to incorporate multiple tools for science communication. In this article, the authors describe an integrated, multimodal unit around the theme of carnivorous plants (CPs) for two first-grade classrooms.

AB  - This article discusses the findings of a survey of nearly 300 computing professionals who are involved in the design and/or development of software across a variety of industries. We report on the surveyed professionals' perceptions of the importance of a range of topics and skills, and the degree to which 55 recent graduates felt that each topic or skill was emphasized in their undergraduate experience. Our findings highlight the value of breadth and flexibility in technical skills, and the universal importance of critical thinking, problem solving, on-the-job learning, and the ability to work well in cross-disciplinary teams. These findings align roughly with recommendations by the ACM/IEEE task force on computing curricula. However, the recent graduates we surveyed report inconsistent coverage of these most important areas within their degree experiences. We discuss implications for education and for future research.

AB  - Evidence-based practice (EBP) is now a well-known paradigm for the athletic training (AT) profession. The Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education accredited programs have required EBP as an explicit focus for professional education, and researchers are gradually producing insightful and relevant evidence concerning the education and implementation of clinically based EBP in educational programs. Likewise, many clinicians are attempting to incorporate EBP into their daily practice in order to guide and enhance patient care, and the Board of Certification has mandated regular EBP education in order to maintain national certification status. Although there remains much work to be completed before AT can claim to be a health care profession that is saturated with EBP, there is growing evidence of positive momentum toward that goal. However, the extent of EBP implementation remains limited to clinically based, patient-oriented outcomes. To date, there is little suggestion that the profession of AT has used an evidence-based approach for other related aspects of its professional practice. To that point, a multifactorial and more comprehensive model for evidence-based AT (EBAT) is presented with the intent of better situating and centering the potentiality for a larger evidence-based culture to inform and guide the AT profession's 3 critical subcomponents practice, regulation, and education. We attempt here to expand upon the paradigm for EBP as a precondition for an overarching, more inclusive EBAT model. To do this, we will introduce and interconnect 2 other critical aspects of professional practice: evidence-based regulation and evidence-based education. Alongside EBP, both evidence-based regulation and education are fundamentally interrelated and vital components of an effective, comprehensive, and progressive evidence-based profession of AT, or EBAT.

AB  - In Australia, the Federal Government and the Australian Academy of Science have developed a programme entitled "Primary Connections" (primaryconnections.org. au), aimed at supporting the teaching of science in the primary sector. The programme makes strong and explicit links between science and literacy through the use of word walls, science journals, discussion groups and procedural texts, among a range of other techniques. There are many ways to link or integrate science and literacy and this article reports on an approach used with pre-service primary teachers at an Australian University, specifically the use of science-based texts to introduce science topics to primary pupils.

AB  - Biology majors team with business administration majors to develop proposals for "green" enterprise for a business plan competition. The course begins with a series of student presentations so that science students learn about the fundamentals of business, and business students learn about environmental biology. Then mixed biology-business student teams prepare a comprehensive business plan for a hypothetical green business start-up. The plans include a discussion of the environmental problem(s) that the proposed product or service addresses, along with a detailed discussion of the financial, managerial, and marketing steps needed to bring the product or service to market. The completed plans are entered into the college's annual business plan competition in which finalists present their plans in front of a panel of outside judges, including investors, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs. The experience gives students insight into the dynamics of cross-functional teaming and the challenges of learning differing vocabularies and ways of looking at problems, thus modeling what many of them will experience in the workforce.

AB  - At Montana State University's Master of Fine Arts program in Science and Natural History Filmmaking, our goal is to re-invent these areas of documentary by admitting students with undergraduate science degrees and teaching them both production and film studies in an intensive three-year curriculum. In the course I teach, "Criticism and Theory: Science Studies for Filmmakers," I apply critical theory simultaneously to the study of science and film. There are two significant results: 1) teaching filmmakers using the tools of academic film studies can provide a conduit for the re-invention of a moribund practice such as the "blue chip" nature film; and 2) the disciplines of science studies and film theory, because they draw from the same critical theory substrate, have much more in common than has previously been written about in either the film or science studies literature.

AB  - The characteristics of successful MOOCs were explored in this study. Thousands of student reviews regarding five xMOOCs (Massive Open Online Course) in the fields of software, science, and management were extracted from the Coursetalk website and analyzed by quantitative and qualitative methods using the Garrison, Anderson, and Archer (2000) Community of Inquiry (CoI) model. The 14 characteristics found to contribute to the success of MOOCs (e.g., teacher, atmosphere, exercise) were partitioned into the teaching, social, and cognitive presence elements. In addition, cluster analysis revealed five types of learners, based on the characteristics they mentioned for course success: atmosphere, exercise, teacher, exam, and unspecified. This divides learners into groups that may prefer social, cognitive, or teaching presence. The findings of this study negate the perception that xMOOCs mostly contain teaching presence elements. This research contributes to the understanding of characteristics that contribute to successful MOOCs and sheds light on the students, too. Listening to the voices of the students and the types of characteristics that they chose to mention, enables further exploration of their preferences and expectations regarding MOOCs and, accordingly, to future adaptation between students' preferences and MOOC characteristics.

AB  - In the last few years, adoption of service learning in higher educational institutions has emerged as a modern teaching and learning strategy. This study is aimed to offer a systematic literature review of service learning implementation in higher education. There is a lack of research on the role of service learning in higher education sector. Moreover, a comprehensive systematic literature review of service learning in higher education is also overlooked in previous studies. Therefore, this study covers an in-depth systematic literature review, which reflects the utilisation approach and outcomes of service learning in higher education. By employing a rigorous exploratory approach, this study offers four major findings: (1) Acceptance and use of service learning in different academic disciplines, which covers a detailed discussion of up to what extent service learning pedagogy practice exists in each discipline. (2) Emerging issues regarding the integration of service learning in different academic disciplines. (3) Comparative analysis of previous service learning frameworks, which includes theoretical foundation, main findings and limitations of each framework. (4) Potential benefits of service learning for all participants. Service learning presents diverse benefits for all stakeholders; we identified the list of potential outcomes in the light of emerging service learning literature. These findings show that service learning is frequently employed in some academic disciplines, i.e. medical and nursing sciences; business and economics; computer science and information system; social studies; teacher education; linguistic and environmental disciplines. Moreover, comparison of previous service learning frameworks revealed that most of them are subject-oriented, specifically focused on institutionalising and practical aspects.

AB  - To bridge the gap for English language learners (ELLs) in science, hybrid language affords the opportunity for students to communicate through various modes, including natural language, visual representations, mathematical expressions, and manual-technical operations. The purpose of this study was to investigate how ELLs use hybrid language (a) to demonstrate their knowledge of science and (b) to engage in argumentation. ELLs participated in a summer enrichment program that integrated language, inquiry-based investigations on erosion, and mathematics. The research team qualitatively assessed 15 student notebooks to trace students' growth in science content as demonstrated by the integration of all 4 modes and the presence of argumentation with embeddedness. The results revealed that 8th-grade ELLs increased their use of each mode of hybrid language over time to communicate their understanding of erosion. As expected, some students integrated all modes of hybrid language more frequently than other students. In addition, argumentation became more evident toward the end of the experience as students used claims and evidence. Students who connected their written claims with visual representations (embeddedness) tended to construct stronger arguments than those who did not make connections between text and visuals. Implications for classroom practices and teacher preparation are discussed.

AB  - This practical lesson on greenhouses implements standards of the Next Generation Science Standards ("K-2 ETS I-2"; "K-LS1-1") and the preschool objectives from the Teaching Strategies GOLD. Teaching Strategies GOLD is an assessment tool available online and in print that can be used with any developmentally appropriate early childhood curriculum. The lesson structure follows the 5E's Learning Cycle Constructivist Model for teaching and the project-based, hands-on approach to learning. The preschool-aged children went on a field trip to a working greenhouse and then collaborated in groups to produce a three-dimensional model of a greenhouse as arts integration into this science project. The children affixed photo stickers from their greenhouse visit onto a recycled plastic container to make the greenhouse building. They used clay, toothpicks, and colored paper leaves to recreate models of plants they had seen and then planted real seeds. The following lesson on plants and greenhouses serves as a successful example of positive arts-integrated science; the children worked together with enjoyment and took pride in their work while the teacher evaluated it as rewarding.

AB  - Visual databases are increasingly important resources through which individuals and groups can undertake species identification. This paper reports research on the collaborative processes undertaken by pre-service teacher students when working in small groups to identify birds using an Internet-based taxonomic resource. The student groups are conceptualised as "knowledge-building communities" working in a "joint problem space" comprising the collective knowledge of the participants interacting with the taxonomic database. Collaborative group work and associated dialogue were recorded with digital video. The recordings were analysed for the categories of dialogue and the categories of knowledge used by the students as they interacted with the taxonomic database and how they drew on their previous experiences of identifying birds. The outcomes are discussed in the context of the interplay of individual and social processes and the interplay between abstraction and lived experience in the joint problem space.

AB  - Compare the sounds produced by a symphony with those produced by a high school orchestra, the notes produced by hitting a tympani with those produced by hitting a trash can lid, and the sounds produced by Al Green with those produced by Yoko Ono. Even though the pitch of a note (determined by the "frequency" of the sound wave) is the same in different instances, the quality of the sound can vary quite a bit. Musicians refer to the quality of a note as the "timbre" of the note. In this article the author describes several activities that investigate what contributes to the timbre of music using a Slinky, 10 feet of latex tubing, and a stringed instrument.

AB  - Interprofessional education (IPE) aims to improve patient outcomes and the quality of care. Interprofessional learning outcomes and interprofessional competencies are now included in many countries' health and social care professions' accreditation standards. While IPE may take place at any time in health professions curricula it tends to focus on professionalism and clinical topics rather than basic science activities. However generic interprofessional competencies could be included in basic science courses that are offered to at least two different professional groups. In developing interprofessional activities at the preclinical level, it is important to define explicit interprofessional learning outcomes plus the content and process of the learning. Interprofessional education must involve interactive learning processes and integration of theory and practice. This paper provides examples of IPE in anatomy and makes recommendations for course development and evaluation.

AB  - Several medical schools have recently described new innovations in interprofessional interactions in gross anatomy courses. The Frank H. Netter MD School of Medicine at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, CT has developed and implemented two contrasting interprofessional experiences in first-year medical student gross anatomy dissection laboratories: long-term, informal visits by pathologists' assistant students who work with the medical students to identify potential donor pathologies, and a short-term, formal visit by fourth-year dental students who teach craniofacial anatomy during the oral cavity dissection laboratory. A survey of attitudes of participants was analyzed and suggest the interprofessional experiences were mutually beneficial for all involved, and indicate that implementing multiple, contrasting interprofessional interactions with different goals within a single course is feasible. Two multiple regression analyses were conducted to analyze the data. The first analysis examined attitudes of medical students towards a pathologists' assistant role in a health care team. The question addressing a pathologists' assistant involvement in the anatomy laboratory was most significant. The second analysis examined attitudes of medical students towards the importance of a good foundation in craniofacial anatomy for clinical practice. This perceived importance is influenced by the presence of dental students in the anatomy laboratory. In both instances, the peer interprofessional interactions in the anatomy laboratory resulted in an overall positive attitude of medical students towards pathologists' assistant and dental students. The consequences of these interactions led to better understanding, appreciation and respect of the different professionals that contribute to a health care team.

AB  - Ongoing changes in mental and personal characteristics of the modern child initiate the updating of means and forms of education. And they, in their turn, update methodological techniques and approaches to the use of methods during the math class. The source of updating methodological techniques may be the principles used when solving scientific problems. Scientific creativity traditionally systematizes knowledge and skills for their use to a wide range of sciences. Therefore, the principles of scientific creativity have a lot in common with different subjects, showing the student the unity of approaches in working with knowledge. In this regard, the article is aimed at substantiating the principles of scientific creativity as effective methodological techniques for finding solutions to math problems and, on their basis, developing recommendations for conducting classes that prepare for final certification at school in mathematics. The leading research methods in this case are: observation of the methodological work of teachers of mathematics, conversations with teachers, analysis of guidance papers and questionnaires of teachers, statistical processing of research results. In 2018-2019 the experiment in which 19 mathematics teachers took part was conducted. Based on its results the authors of the article succeeded in: highlighting the principles of finding solutions to math problems based on the approaches used in scientific creativity; developing and implementing on the basis of these principles recommendations for conducting classes that prepare for final certification at school in mathematics. The effectiveness of using the principles of finding solutions to math problems was assessed. It allowed the authors to conclude that students have an increase in the speed of finding solutions to math problems by an average of 11%. Practical use of the proposed principles makes it possible to organize training for schoolchildren in solving math problems in traditional forms of teaching, but taking into account the particularities of the development of the modern schoolchild. Methodological recommendations developed by the authors can be used to teach students how to find solutions to math problems during classes that prepare for final certification at school in mathematics.

AB  - In this paper, in order to pursue the conversation begun by Fages and Albe ("Cult Stud Sci Educ" 2014), I highlight three conceptual contributions that could be made by familiarizing nanoscience and nanotechnology researchers and engineers with the work being carried out in science and technology studies and public understanding of science. First, it would allow them to become acquainted with less naive conceptualizations of the capacities of citizens. Second, it would help them to consider the nature and role of scientific expertise from richer, more nuanced and less stereotypical conceptual angles. Third and lastly, it would allow future researchers and engineers to become familiar with different models of interaction between citizens, scientists and decision.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of students' science learning in Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) at one elementary school in Taiwan. This study investigated student perceptions of both the content and language achievement of science learning in CLIL. Data collection techniques included graphic organizers, individual interviews, students' self-assessment, and students' tests. Findings showed that CLIL helped enrich student vocabulary size, foster student science knowledge, and lead them to expect to learn other subjects in English. They also enjoyed the CLIL approach, but expressed limited knowledge about the school flower.

AB  - Medicine is increasingly focused on team-based practice as interprofessional cooperation leads to better patient care. Thus, it is necessary to teach teamwork and collaboration with other health care professionals in undergraduate medical education to ensure that trainees entering the workforce are prepared to work in teams. Gross anatomy provides an opportunity to expose students to interprofessional education (IPE) early in their training. The purpose of this study is to describe an IPE experience and report if the experience has lasting influence on the participating students. The Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) questionnaire was administered to first year medical (MD) and physical therapy (PT) students at Mayo Medical School and Mayo School of Health Sciences. Results demonstrated an openness on the part of the students to IPE. Interprofessional education experiences were incorporated into gross anatomy courses in both medical and PT curricula. The IPE experiences included a social event, peer-teaching, and collaborative clinical problem-solving sessions. These sessions enhanced gross anatomy education by reinforcing previous material and providing the opportunity to work on clinical cases from the perspective of two healthcare disciplines. After course completion, students again completed the RIPLS. Finally, one year after course completion, students were asked to provide feedback on their experience. The post-curricular RIPLS, similar to the pre-curricular RIPLS, illustrated openness to IPE from both MD and PT students. There were however, significant differences in MD and PT perceptions of roles and responsibilities. One-year follow-up indicated long-term retention of lessons learned during IPE.

AB  - This study evaluates the effects of the Mathematics, Arts, and Creativity in Education (MACE) program on students' ability in geometry and visual arts in the upper grades of elementary school. The program consisted of a lesson series for fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students in which geometry and visual arts were integrated, alongside with a professional development program for teachers. A quasi-experimental study was conducted in which three groups of teachers and their classes were investigated. One group of teachers taught the lesson series and followed a professional development program (n=36), one group of teachers only taught the lesson series (n=36), and a comparison group taught a series of traditional geometry lessons from mathematical textbooks (n=43). A geometrical ability, creativity, and vocabulary test and a visual arts assignment were used in a pre- and post-measurements to test the effects of the MACE program. Results showed that students who received the MACE lesson series improved more than students who received regular geometry lessons only in geometrical aspects perceived in a visual artwork. Regarding students' understanding and explanation of geometrical phenomena and geometrical creative thinking, all students improved, but no differences between the groups were found, which implies that on these aspects the MACE program was as effective as the comparison group that received a more traditional form of geometry education.

AB  - This study explored the teacher knowledge manifestation of Integrated Science (IS) teachers who have specialised in Chemistry, Biology or Physics during their pre-service teacher education. 60 experienced Integrated Science teachers responded to an 'Integrated Science Teacher Knowledge' questionnaire which embraced different dimensions of teacher knowledge. The results of the study indicate that the IS teachers have a common set of knowledge, skills, and dispositions that are, in their professional opinion, needed and in some instances, would enable them to teach IS. The research participants had considerable knowledge as well as clear views about what it meant for them to be IS teachers. It however should be noted that there was a marked variance in the perception of the three cohorts of teachers towards teaching through Practical Work, importance of pre-service teacher education specialisation towards teaching IS and knowledge of students' culture. This study provides contextual inputs to effective IS teacher education re-alignment informed by the IS teacher practitioners, those with the craft knowledge of the contextual environment of the IS classrooms.

AB  - Teamwork and the interprofessional collaboration of all health professions are a guarantee of patient safety and highly qualified treatment in patient care. In the daily clinical routine, physicians and nurses must work together, but the education of the different health professions occurs separately in various places, mostly without interrelated contact. Such training abets mutual misunderstanding and cements professional protectionism, which is why interprofessional education can play an important role in dismantling such barriers to future cooperation. In this article, a pilot project in interprofessional education involving both medical and nursing students is presented, and the concept and the course of training are described in detail. The report illustrates how nursing topics and anatomy lectures can be combined for interprofessional learning in an early phase of training. Evaluation of the course showed that the students were highly satisfied with the collaborative training and believed interprofessional education (IPE) to be an important experience for their future profession and understanding of other health professionals. The results show that the IPE teaching concept, which combines anatomy and nursing topics, provides an optimal setting for learning together and helps nurses and doctors in training to gain knowledge about other health professionals' roles, thus evolving mutual understanding.

AB  - Students with disabilities perform below their non-disabled peers in science (National Science Foundation, 2015). The purpose of the exploratory research was to determine if informal science learning activities offered in Florida districts make a difference on the performance of students with disabilities (SWD) on the 2015 8th grade Florida science assessment using quasi-experimental research methods. After determining a statistically significant difference does exist on the difference between students with and without disabilities on the 8th Grade Florida Science Assessment, the researcher determined if STEM personnel track the number of students with disabilities who participate in STEM activities. The number and types of STEM activities were collected by district. Lastly, the researcher determined there was a small correlation between SWD performance on the Science assessment and the number of STEM activities offered in each district.

AB  - It is noted that the "Canadian Journal of Science, Mathematics and Technology Education" (CJSMTE) was founded with the support of a donation of $1.0 million from the Imperial Oil Charitable Foundation. Four goals were uppermost in the thinking behind the journal: first, it should be bilingual; second, it should be cross-disciplinary; third, it should project a distinctive and independent voice for Canadian educators; fourth, it should celebrate diversity of views and perspectives while upholding values of excellence and equity. Some early teething problems are discussed and questions are raised about what constitutes a successful international journal, including the originality and rigour of published papers and the richness of interactions among authors, editors, and manuscript reviewers.

AB  - The visualization of latent fingerprints often involves the use of a chemical substance that creates a contrast between the fingerprint residues and the surface on which the print was deposited. The chemical-aided visualization techniques can be divided into two main categories: those that chemically react with the fingerprint residue and those that adhere to the fingerprint residue by intermolecular forces. A plethora of empirically effective fingerprint revelation methods have been developed but the chemistry is often incompletely understood. This article briefly describes the chemical rationale of most fingerprint visualization techniques practiced today. This material is suitable for a forensic chemistry course or for an introductory chemistry course to introduce the relevance of chemistry in law enforcement. This material may also apply to an organic or biochemistry course when discussing noncovalent intermolecular interactions.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the ways in which preservice elementary teacher candidates designed integrated reading and science lessons that evoked the use of similar cognitive skills in both subjects, such as sequencing, predicting, classifying, or noting cause and effect. The authors provided the candidates with a lesson plan template focused on making meaning for hands-on science activities along with appropriate fiction or nonfiction texts. We used qualitative content analysis to determine the candidates' (a) general approaches to integrated lesson planning, (b) use of pedagogical moves to promote science understanding and reading comprehension, and (c) use of essential elements of inquiry-based teaching. Results indicated most candidates demonstrated proficiency and creativity in identifying specific pedagogical moves to highlight students' cognition and metacognition of similar thinking skills and to drive home the science concepts. We discuss the possibilities for using science to leverage reading comprehension and reading to leverage science understandings in elementary classrooms.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the relationship among some intrapersonal factors including individual professional competency, interdisplinary ability, social skills, and team cohesion. Results showed that each of these factors could influence the innovation competency of students enrolled in design programs. To scrutinize effects of these factors on innovation competency, this study examined their correlations with innovation competency and their internal structure in order to comprehensively understand influential processes and paths for innovation competency enhancement in design education. The validated questionnaire was delivered to 296 students enrolled in design programs of universities in Taiwan. SPSS 18.0 and AMOS statistics were used to analyze collected data. To address research questions of this study, t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson correlation analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were performed. The following crucial conclusions were reached: (1) Students enrolled in design programs generally possessed high levels of professional competency, interdisplinary ability, social skills capability, team cohesion, thinking style, and innovation competency; (2) There were significant and positive relationships among these factors. This implies that these intrapersonal factors are highly relied on each other because they co-exist and interact with each other. Thus, any change in one factor would create chain effects; and (3) These highly correlated intrapersonal factors can be developed in real environment through understanding their interactive, hierarchical, and consecutive processes rather than through focusing on effects of a single factor. These conclusions could provide several suggestions for professionals, managers, and, more importantly, school educators in relevant fields. Two suggestions are provided for future high quality and comprehensive research to further understand and improve strategies needed for design education.

AB  - The paper analyzes studies on continuing education, explains the concept of "continuity of patriotic education and moral development by means of regional culture", determines the uniqueness of regional culture as the core of patriotic education and moral development, and characterizes the model of continuity of patriotic education and moral development. The practical value of the paper is that its results could be used to develop the cultural potential of Russian regions. The results can also be used by the Federal districts administration, subjects of the Russian Federation, interregional cooperation associations, transnational companies, and governmental agencies that deal with the development of regional culture in Russia, in particular, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Regional Development of the Russian Federation, and the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation. The importance of regionalization as the key factor in the improvement of patriotic education and moral development was substantiated based on the analysis of ways of overcoming discontinuity of patriotic education and moral development. This enables evaluating the significance of the potential of regional schools and higher educational institutions and their effect on the formation of an individual's worldview.

In both cases the VE programme was fully integrated in the courses as a graded element. The students of beginner Italian participated in the four-week long Connect Express. While liking the experience, they found that the VE was still too disconnected from their aim of learning a language. The students of Intercultural Communication (IC) participated in the eight-week long Connect Global. For them, the success of the experience was linked to the group composition and the English proficiency level of participants.

AB  - For more than 40 years, the international community has acknowledged the role education might play in environmental awareness and conservation. The last major initiative came when the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed a Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005-2014). In the final year of the decade, teachers still struggle to realise education for sustainable development (ESD). One of the challenges teachers face with respect to ESD is the inclusion of even more content into an already overloaded curriculum. In response, it has been suggested that ESD should be introduced as an integrated perspective across the content of all existing subjects. This paper offers a model for how ESD can be realised in chemistry education. The model has been developed to support chemistry teachers in their educational planning and consists of 5 categories: chemical content knowledge, chemistry in context, the distinctiveness and methodological character of chemistry, ESD competences and lived ESD. The ESD model is illustrated through 5 ellipses, visualising the hierarchy of the categories, as they exist in different levels. All 5 ESD categories need to be considered in a holistic ESD approach.

AB  - This article argues that scholarship on literacy in and across the disciplines has disproportionately focused on the core subjects of English, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies rather than on "specialist" subjects such as Physical Education. This disparity in emphasis has provided little guidance to specialist teachers seeking to understand and address the literacy demands of subject areas that often privilege an expanded conception of literacy. To illustrate the affordances of such analysis for PE teachers as well as their literacy colleagues, the reading demands of a particular multimodal text from PE--a three-part basketball play--are presented in light of key themes from the US Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy. Complexities related to collective, embodied, and sequential meaning construction are explored. Recommendations for instruction and professional collaboration are shared.

AB  - The current discussion among adolescent literacy researchers describes two positions at either end of a continuum: a generalist content area reading approach and a disciplinary literacy approach. Within the field, there are misunderstandings about the disciplinary literacy approach and claims that adolescents are ill suited to the kinds of thinking advocated by disciplinary literacy scholars. This article explores disciplinary literacy through the lens of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and argues that requirements for discipline-appropriate literacy abilities are already embedded in national standards for English language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies. We explore the practices and cross-cutting concepts described in the NGSS and provide examples of discipline-appropriate thinking associated with selected practices and concepts.

AB  - The value of service-learning as a high-impact educational practice in college courses is further documented here through client-centered student projects seeking to increase SOLE food-- sustainable, organic, local, and ethically produced--on the Utah State University campus. Honors students enrolled in a Think Tank series of courses in Science, Social Sciences, and Arts/Humanities completed six cross-disciplinary projects focused on various aspects of dining services and food sources on campus, including recycling, food waste, food recovery, and local sourcing. Post-project student reflections indicate that students were much more aware of campus-wide sustainability issues and how they, as campus citizens, could contribute in meaningful ways. Student also demonstrated the ability to property design research projects and engage in data-informed problem solving as a result of their service-learning project. Students also learned to successfully work in groups and appreciate and encourage the strengths of each team member.

The four works of art discussed are examples that can be linked visually and conceptually to physics properties in mathematics, space, energy, and light. The discussion questions are designed for grades 8 through 10. Art teachers are urged to share this article with science teachers; team teaching with a science teacher would be especially appropriate.

AB  - Healthcare delivery is reliant on a team-based approach, and interprofessional education (IPE) provides a means by which such collaboration skills can be fostered prior to entering the workplace. IPE within healthcare programs has been associated with improved collaborative behavior, patient care and satisfaction, reduced clinical error, and diminished negative professional stereotypes. An intensive interprofessional gross anatomy dissection course was created in 2009 to facilitate IPE at McMaster University. Data were collected from five cohorts over five years to determine the influence of this IPE format on the attitudes and perceptions of students towards other health professions. Each year, 28 students from the medicine, midwifery, nursing, physician's assistant, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy programs were randomly assigned into interprofessional teams for 10 weeks. Sessions involved an anatomy and scope-of-practice presentation, a small-group case-based session, and a dissection. A before/after design measured changes in attitudes and perceptions, while focus group data elaborated on the student experience with the course. Pre- and postmatched data revealed significant improvements in positive professional identity, competency and autonomy, role clarity and attitudes toward other health professions. Qualitative analysis of intraprofessional focus group interviews revealed meaningful improvements in a number of areas including learning anatomy, role clarity, and attitudes towards other health professions.

AB  - This paper reports on an innovative Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programme which addressed transition issues and issues with conducting outdoor work and attitudes towards science through 'Shared Learning' days between elementary and middle school transition classes. Teachers supported each other to overcome issues with conducting outdoor work and contributed their expertise from their educational stage. The project utilised a blended CPD approach of workshops, coteaching and in-class support and was based upon a wealth earlier successful CPD programmes to result in a sound theoretical framework. The outcomes were measured using a thorough mixed-methods approach. This paper will report on the achieved outcomes with effective outdoor learning as the vehicle to overcome identified issues and key challenges for policy development.

AB  - Much of the mathematical reasoning employed in the typical introductory physics course can be traced to Pythagorean roots planted over two thousand years ago. Besides obvious examples involving the Pythagorean theorem, I draw attention to standard physics problems and derivations which often unknowingly rely upon the Pythagoreans' work on proportion, music, geometry, harmony, the golden ratio, and cosmology. Examples are drawn from mechanics, electricity, sound, optics, energy conservation and relativity. An awareness of the primary sources of the mathematical techniques employed in the physics classroom could especially benefit students and educators at schools which encourage integration of their various courses in history, science, philosophy, and the arts.

AB  - The Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 mandates that English language proficiency (ELP) standards align with content standards. As the fast-growing population of English learners (ELs) is expected to meet college- and career-ready content standards, the purpose of this article is to highlight key issues in aligning ELP standards with content standards. The overarching question is how to align ELP standards with academically rigorous and language-intensive disciplinary practices of content standards while respecting and maintaining the nature of the discipline within each area. I begin by describing contributions and shortcomings of content standards and ELP standards. Next, I propose consideration of three components in aligning ELP standards with content standards: (a) norms of disciplinary practices across content areas, (b) developmental progressions of disciplinary practices across K-12 grade levels or bands and across content areas, and (c) language use across levels of English proficiency. For each component, the challenges in establishing alignment and potential trade-offs in addressing these challenges are discussed. Finally, I highlight how these challenges present opportunities for substantive collaboration between EL education and content areas to move these fields forward and ensure ELs achieve academically rigorous content standards while developing ELP.

AB  - This qualitative case study looks closely at an elementary teacher who participated in professional development experiences that helped her develop a hybrid practice of using inquiry-based science to teach both science content and English language development (ELD) to her students, many of whom are English language learners (ELLs). This case study examines the teacher's reflections on her teaching and her students' learning as she engaged her students in science learning and supported their developing language skills. It explicates the professional learning experiences that supported the development of this hybrid practice. Closely examining the pedagogical practice and reflections of a teacher who is developing an inquiry-based approach to both science learning and language development can provide insights into how teachers come to integrate their professional development experiences with their classroom expertise in order to create a hybrid inquiry-based science ELD practice. This qualitative case study contributes to the emerging scholarship on the development of teacher practice of inquiry-based science instruction as a vehicle for both science instruction and ELD for ELLs. This study demonstrates how an effective teaching practice that supports both the science and language learning of students can develop from ongoing professional learning experiences that are grounded in current perspectives about language development and that immerse teachers in an inquiry-based approach to learning and instruction. Additionally, this case study also underscores the important role that professional learning opportunities can play in supporting teachers in developing a deeper understanding of the affordances that inquiry-based science can provide for language development.

AB  - This qualitative study examines the change in a preserve program as our faculty members systematically work together to change the culture of our college to one in which everyone assists future teachers to work with ELLs. The iTeach ELL Systems Framework has promoted understanding of the interconnected nature of student learning, which includes: university/school partnerships designed to impact that learning through more effectively prepared teacher candidates, school and university organizational features, and state statutes and policy regulations. One focus of this work is to infuse problem-based learning (PBL) and ELL strategies into science methods courses. This qualitative study of efforts and approaches to reform science methods courses has identified three themes: a) Value of Agreeing on Terms (b) Value of Integrating Content and Language Learning (c) Value of Presenting a Unified Message. Successes and challenges for supporting pre-service teachers to develop knowledge of both PBL and ELL strategies are discussed.

AB  - The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) (2014) sets forth that children learning science and engineering practices in the early years lays "the foundation for a progression of science learning in K-12 settings and throughout their entire lives." So, it is important to build upon children's natural curiosities and expose them to thinking like engineers early on and long before college. The Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM) lesson plan presented in this article about matter was co-taught to a gifted and talented fifth-grade class by a university professor and an elementary classroom teacher. Collaboration among experts across fields resulted in the lesson design and incorporated science (metals and their properties), technology (using and understanding technology systems), engineering (the engineering design process), art (sculpture), and math (data and proportionality). The lesson resulted in students' greater understanding of matter (metals) through the roles of engineers and artists. The engineering aspect of this STEAM lessons lends itself well to fostering understanding of solid matter (such as metals) and its interactions.

AB  - English is the medium of instruction in all Science and Engineering undergraduate programmes at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Therefore, students who do not meet minimum proficiency requirements are placed in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses to help them improve. Other generic, domain-specific and workplace communication courses are also offered as core courses or electives so that most students take at least one such course before they graduate. The strong focus on communication skills training for NUS students is aimed at equipping them with academic writing and speaking skills, in general, and workplace interaction skills. This paper, however, discusses the "embedding" of communication skills training within the content curricula of two modules in electrical engineering and one module in a special science programme in NUS as a pedagogical strategy to 'enculturate' [Prior, P. 1998. "Writing/Disciplinarity: A Sociohistoric Account of Literate Activity in the Academy." Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates] students into the academic and professional discourse communities of their disciplines. These three implementations are unique, firstly, because they 'include' all students in the cohort in the training, regardless of whether they have taken EAP or other communication courses [Wingate, U., and C. Tribble. 2011. "The Best of Both Worlds? Towards an English for Academic Purposes/Academic Literacies Writing Pedagogy." "Studies in Higher Education" 1-15. iFirst Article]. Secondly, content and communication lecturers collaborate closely with one another and with students to co-construct the latter's deeper engagement in their disciplines.

AB  - An integrated science curriculum assists pupils to retain learnings better than to separate academic disciplines. Too frequently, science teachers teach each academic discipline as separate entities. However, there is much correlating of science with language, for example which might well be implemented in teaching and learning situations. Thus, reading, writing, and listening skills need developing in order to strengthen the science curriculum.

AB  - The Mayo Innovation Scholars Program introduces undergraduates to technology transfer in biomedical sciences by having teams of students from multiple disciplines (e.g., biology, chemistry, economics, and business) analyze inventions in development at the Mayo Clinic. Over 6 months, teams consult with inventors, intellectual property experts, and faculty mentors as
they research and explore project viability, potential applications, market forces, ethical dilemmas, and financial considerations. Team members read relevant patent applications as well as journal articles from within the basic
sciences, clinical sciences, and business. In some instances, they perform original research, such as surveys of health care providers or potential consumers. The program culminates in formal presentations that include teams' recommendations about what should be done with the invention (e.g., shelve it or pursue a licensing agreement, or pursue some other option) to an audience of intellectual property experts, physicians, faculty, and student
peers. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - The Bitara-STEM[TM] Training of Trainer Programme is a short-term professional development programme aimed to increase STEM teachers or facilitators' abilities to teach integrated STEM education and to increase their efficacy, beliefs and attitudes of integrated STEM teaching. The programme involves 35 facilitators, representing a broad spectrum of STEM fields. Pre- and post-test results of the participants' beliefs, attitudes, perceived efficacy and content knowledge in the context of integrated STEM teaching revealed significant changes. The findings also revealed: (1) knowledge of integrated STEM teaching to be related to facilitators' efficacy for teaching integrated STEM and (2) facilitators' attitudes to be related to beliefs of integrated STEM teaching. The outcomes of this study provide evidence that a relatively short-term professional development can have a significant impact on facilitators' beliefs, attitudes, efficacy and knowledge of integrated STEM teaching and STEM concepts.

AB  - The inclusion of engineering practices poses a challenge for many science teachers trying to meet the expectations of the Next Generation Science Standards because they lack formal training in engineering. This, however, may provide an opportunity for science teacher educators striving to improve the use of learner-centered teaching practices by science teachers. The exploratory study in this article describes the impact to teachers' practices of a professional development program on the inclusion of engineering in high school chemistry. Survey data and a case study of 1 of the participants were used to assess the professional development program. By the end of the program, teachers described using engineering activities in their classroom along with more general changes to other aspects of their teaching. The subject of the case study included new student-centered teaching methods in his teaching practice in the year following the professional development. In line with conceptual change theory and transfer of learning theory, the results of this study led to the hypothesis that learning to include engineering in their classrooms may improve secondary science teachers' use of learner-centered practices throughout their teaching.

AB  - A promising approach to increase students' motivation for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is integrated STEM education (iSTEM). This is an instructional approach that emphasizes the deeper connections between the STEM disciplines by involving students in design challenges centered around real-world problems. However, the successful implementation of a new instructional approach, such as iSTEM, strongly depends on teachers' attitudes toward the innovation. Therefore, a deeper understanding of teachers' attitudes toward teaching iSTEM is necessary. This study uses a survey method to investigate the influence of teachers' background characteristics and school context variables on teachers' attitudes toward teaching iSTEM. To do so, a differential approach is used. Attitudes toward five key principles for iSTEM (integration, problem-centered, inquiry-based, design-based, and cooperative learning) are examined separately to get a more in-depth and nuanced insight into the factors influencing these attitudes. Results of the multiple regression analyses show that participation in professional development is positively linked to teachers' attitudes toward all key principles, whereas several other teacher and school context variables are positively correlated with attitudes toward one or two principles. Moreover, experience in mathematics and total years of teaching show a negative correlation with several aspects of teachers' attitudes toward teaching iSTEM. Findings of this study are valuable, since they not only provide insight into possible barriers to the implementation of iSTEM but also suggest opportunities for overcoming these barriers.

AB  - Teaching object-oriented programming to students in an in-classroom environment demands well-thought didactic and pedagogical strategies in order to guarantee a good level of apprenticeship. To teach it on a completely distance learning environment (e-learning) imposes possibly other strategies, besides those that the e-learning model of Open University of Portugal dictates. This article analyses the behavior of the students of the 1st cycle in Computer Science while interacting with the object-oriented programming (OOP) discipline available to them on the Moodle platform. Through the evaluation of the level of interaction achieved in a group of relevant selected actions by the students, it is possible to identify their relevancy to the success of the programming learning process. Data was extracted from Moodle, numerically analyzed, and, with the use of some charts, behavior patterns of students were identified. This paper points out potential new approaches to be considered in e-learning in order to enhance programming learning results, besides confirming a high level of drop-out and a low level of interaction, thus finding no clear correlation between students' success and the number of online actions (especially in forums), which reveals a possible failure of the main pillar on which the e-learning model relies.

AB  - The relevance of the investigated problem is caused by the objective necessity of construction of the Russian examination practice, taking into account the leading trends in the education system development, where student-activity approach advocates the dominant, and insufficient development of this issue in both the theoretical and methodical plan, based on the primary focus of the examination content on reproductive component, does not dock with the modern educational realities. Objective of the research: to develop and pedagogically substantiate the didactic conditions and means of improving the examination control procedures at a vocational school in the conditions of modernization of Russian education, drawing on diagnostically specified learning objectives and focus on personal characteristics of the student. Leading approach to the study of this problem was the holding of a retrospective analysis of the literature on the quality control of the educational process, the analysis of the actual state of the problem of examination quality control of preparation of students of professional institutions in theory and practice, with the purpose to identify the didactic conditions and means of improving the examination control in a vocational school. The author's version of pedagogically-based examination procedures in a vocational school in the conditions of modernization of education is represented in the article, developed on the basis of the revealed didactic conditions (diagnostic mission objectives, focus on level and student-activity approaches, reflected in the structure and content of the exam, correcting pre-exam training) and means (typology of examination tasks, complex advisory activities). The article represents practical significance for using by vocational school teachers in the process of organizing and carrying out the examination; researchers in the field of vocational training in the study of problems related to the examination control.

AB  - This study investigated the efficacy of a multi-component reading comprehension instructional approach, Collaborative Strategic Reading (CSR), compared to business-as-usual instructional methods with 19 teachers and 1074 students in middle school social studies and science classrooms in a large urban district. Researchers collaborated with school personnel to provide teachers with ongoing professional development and classroom support. Using an experimental design, teachers' classrooms were assigned either to CSR or to a business-as-usual comparison condition. Multi-level analyses showed that students receiving CSR instruction scored higher on a standardized reading comprehension assessment compared to their peers in comparison classrooms (g¬†=¬†0.18, p¬†<¬†0.05). While implementation varied across classrooms, students in the CSR condition were observed using CSR strategies and working together in small groups. Teachers attended to the quality of student work and provided more feedback when teaching CSR. CSR is an effective method to improve the reading comprehension of adolescents and to increase their access to complex informational text.

AB  - This study is part of a larger investigation which focused on determining and comparing the perceptions of agriculture teachers and science teachers on integrating science into agricultural education programs. Science and agriculture teachers' perceptions of barriers to integrating science, the support of stakeholders, and collaboration between science and agriculture teachers and programs were investigated. The majority of both science and agriculture teachers were in agreement that funding, equipment, and the science teachers' lack of an agricultural background were barriers to integration. However, they differed in their level of agreement about curriculum and teachers' philosophical differences as barriers. Both groups agreed their school has strong science and agriculture programs, that collaboration would benefit students, and that the two departments have something to offer each other. However, fewer than one-half of teachers in both groups reported they work in a collaborative effort with the other department. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - Practice based interprofessional education opportunities are proposed as a mechanism for health professionals to learn teamwork skills and gain an understanding of the roles of others. Primary care is an area of practice that offers a promising option for interprofessional student learning. In this study, we investigated what and how students from differing professions learn together. Our findings inform the design of future interprofessional education initiatives. Using activity theory, we conducted an ethnographic investigation of interprofessional education in primary care. During a 5¬†months period, we observed 14 clinic sessions involving mixed discipline student teams who interviewed people with chronic disease. Teams were comprised of senior medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, pharmacy and physiotherapy entry level students. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with seven clinical educators. Data were analysed to ascertain the objectives, tools, rules and division of labour. Two integrated activity systems were identified: (1) student teams gathering information to determine patients' health care needs and (2) patients either as health consumers or student educators. Unwritten rules regarding "shared contribution", "patient as key information source" and "time constraints" were identified. Both the significance of software literacy on team leadership, and a pre-determined structure of enquiry, highlighted the importance of careful consideration of the tools used in interprofessional education, and the way they can influence practice. The systems of practice identified provide evidence of differing priorities and values, and multiple perspectives of how to manage health. The work reinforced the value of the patients' voice in clinical and education processes.

AB  - While a number of studies have investigated people's perceptions or conceptions of creativity, there is a lack of studies looking into science teachers' views. The study aimed to explore the meanings of scientific creativity in the classroom context as perceived by a selective group of upper primary (Grades 3-6; student ages 8-12) science teachers (n?=?16) in Taiwan. Using a self-report, open-ended questionnaire and follow-up interviews, the participants responded to questions as to (1) what quality, behaviours and abilities characterise a creative learner in their science classrooms, (2) what a science classroom should be like if it is to facilitate scientific creativity, and (3) whether and what particular elements of the inquiry approach are incorporated in such a classroom. The analyses revealed that the teachers captured the central features of creativity and proposed diverse ideas about how to foster creativity in school science, but seemed to overlook some aspects, such as convergent thinking, problem-finding, and linking the arts and science. These missing features are regarded as important for scientific creativity in contemporary research. The findings were discussed along with their implications for teacher education and future research.

AB  - The Whole School Success Partnership (TWSSP) worked to develop practices and cultures that emphasized student success in five middle and high schools. Because this project took place in secondary schools where teachers have disciplinary specializations, the whole school approach came with unique opportunities and challenges. Here we describe how three critical components of this project, whole-school vision; tools to translate vision into practice; and ongoing, collaborative teacher learning were enacted to meet these opportunities and challenges. We then detail outcomes revealed by the project evaluation. We found the whole-school approach provided a common ground for facilitating school-wide change and developing a shared perspective on teaching and learning. To do this, TWSSP integrated its activities with school goals and initiatives, placed teachers in high-functioning professional learning communities (PLCs), and frequently revisited a whole-school vision. The project helped teachers connect across subject-area silos, supporting and sustaining whole school reform.

AB  - Many findings from research as well as reports from teachers describe students' problem solving strategies as manipulation of formulas by rote. The resulting dissatisfaction with quantitative physical textbook problems seems to influence the attitude towards the role of mathematics in physics education in general. Mathematics is often seen as a tool for calculation which hinders a conceptual understanding of physical principles. However, the role of mathematics cannot be reduced to this technical aspect. Hence, instead of putting mathematics away we delve into the nature of physical science to reveal the strong conceptual relationship between mathematics and physics. Moreover, we suggest that, for both prospective teaching and further research, a focus on deeply exploring such interdependency can significantly improve the understanding of physics. To provide a suitable basis, we develop a new model which can be used for analysing different levels of mathematical reasoning within physics. It is also a guideline for shifting the attention from technical to structural mathematical skills while teaching physics. We demonstrate its applicability for analysing physical-mathematical reasoning processes with an example.

AB  - This article reports a qualitative inquiry into school leaders' and teachers' rationales for teaching to develop students' "mathematical literacy." The study is rooted in an exploration of the meanings that the school leaders and teachers hold about the term mathematical literacy. Six leaders and three grade 9 mathematics teachers from three schools were interviewed. Analysis framed within cultural-historical activity theory indicates that mathematical literacy is perceived as a desired outcome of schooling, and that teaching for mathematical literacy is connected to school leaders' and teachers' contradictory rationales for teaching. The rationales are connected to use value, meaning, teaching practice, teacher competences and knowledge, and universality.

AB  - Through a collaborative effort between a sixth-grade teacher and two university faculty, we designed an integrated unit to learn about motion and we learned that an integrated teaching and learning experience about motion is MESSY (i.e., it includes movement, engagement, social interactions, spontaneity, yikes, and yippees!). We engaged in a twofold goal process of integrating mathematics, science, and technology. First, we embedded an inquiry approach in our planning and facilitation of learning experiences. Second, students coconstructed their understandings of motion through collective inquiry. School and university faculty, as well as students, learned about inquiry, about using motion detectors to learn and teach about motion, and about how mutual respect and collaboration support productive STEM learning, teaching, and research.

AB  - This paper describes a case study of how a middle school literacy coach and a science teacher attempted to improve disciplinary literacy teaching in a sixth-grade science class. The collaborative inquiry exposed the disciplinary knowledge gap of the literacy coach (a former language arts teacher) and the science teacher's limited knowledge of literacy instruction. These shared disciplinary knowledge gaps necessitated the co-construction of collaborative practices to ameliorate the tension and improve disciplinary literacy instruction. Through a recognition of individual knowledge and the use of responsive disciplinary teaching, the participants created collaborative symbiosis. To improve disciplinary literacy teaching, schools should recognize teacher disciplinary knowledge and expand participation in discipline-specific collaborative inquiry.

AB  - The increasing complexity of the new breed of distributed intelligent systems, such as the Internet of Things, which require a diversity of languages and protocols, can only be tamed with design and programming best practices. Interest is also growing for including the human factor, as advocated by the "ambient intelligence" (AmI) research field, whose focus is on transparently and intelligently supporting people. These new design methodologies are increasingly needed in the toolbox of new electronic and computer engineers, and teaching strategies should be devised that allow students to acquire a systems-level view instead of getting lost in technology-oriented approaches. This paper describes a study carried out over two academic years, in a course in AmI at Politecnico di Torino, Italy. In the course, a project-based learning approach was adopted, in which students design and prototype an AmI system, and their progress is closely monitored throughout the semester. This paper presents the learning goals and teaching strategies, analyzes the learning outcomes from the qualitative and quantitative points of view, and highlights the lessons learned in the process.

AB  - The curriculum module described in this article addresses the global issue of ocean acidification (OA) (Feely 2009; Figure 1). OA is a harmful consequence of excess carbon dioxide (CO[subscript 2]) in the atmosphere and poses a threat to marine life, both algae and animal. This module seeks to teach and help students master the cross-disciplinary content and skills needed to address such problems. Field testing with thousands of high school students has shown that this module, titled Ocean Acidification: A Systems Approach to a Global Problem, builds students' abilities to understand, research, experiment, and care about ocean acidification. In six lessons, the module teaches 21st-century skills (Partnership for 21st Century Skills 2002) and addresses standards from the" Next Generation Science Standards" (NGSS Lead States 2013) and "Common Core State Standards" (NGAC and CCSSO 2010).

AB  - Advertising technology is advancing quickly incorporating digital techniques that may be beyond the experience of the individual faculty member. Collaborative teaching, where faculty members from different disciplines co-teach a course, may be a solution. This report assesses the learning outcomes of an advertising technology course taught by faculty from one university's advertising, computer science and human-computer interaction programs. The course was run twice, with a third one in progress. Students were predominantly advertising majors, with a minority of computer science and design majors. Two semesters of pre- and post-tests were analyzed, finding increases in student comfort with preparing and presenting technologically advanced solutions to advertising challenges.

We describe our process for revising the professor's writing assignment to make his expectations more explicit and for creating scaffolding materials that we delivered in classroom workshops to assist students' pre-writing. We provide insights about the positive impact of the writing workshops on students' writing from an end-of-semester interview with the professor and from interviews with students about their perceptions of the workshops and the personalized feedback they received.

AB  - The paper addresses the apparent lack of impact of "history in mathematics education" in mathematics education research in general, and proposes new avenues for research. We identify two general scenarios of integrating history in mathematics education that each gives rise to different problems. The first scenario occurs when history is used as a "tool" for the learning and teaching of mathematics, the second when history of mathematics as a "goal" is pursued as an integral part of mathematics education. We introduce a multiple-perspective approach to history, and suggest that research on history in mathematics education follows one of two different avenues in dealing with these scenarios. The first is to focus on students' development of mathematical competencies when history is used a tool for the learning of curriculum-dictated mathematical in-issues. A framework for this is described. Secondly, when using history as a goal it is argued that an anchoring of the meta-issues in the related in-issues is essential, and a framework for this is given. Both frameworks are illustrated through empirical examples.

AB  - Geometry and culture are interrelated, making school geometry closely connected to the environment as well as culture in which it is taught. With regard to this connectedness, the Zimbabwean mathematics syllabus indicates that geometry should be connected to the learners' environment and culture. This article explores teacher-related challenges to the integration of ethnomathematics approaches into the teaching of geometry. Findings are based on feedback received from questionnaires and focus-group discussions in which 40 in-service mathematics teachers expressed their views on the challenges that affect the integration of ethnomathematics approaches into the teaching of geometry. Major challenges included lack of knowledge on ethnomathematics approaches and how to integrate these approaches into the teaching of geometry; teachers' lack of geometry content knowledge, teachers' views of geometry taught in schools, teachers' competence in teaching geometry, teaching and professional experience as well as resistance to change by teachers. The study recommends that teacher training institutions need to redesign their curricula to include ethnomathematics approaches and that there is need for in-service training on ethnomathematics approaches.

AB  - This study investigates the way collaborative learning that occurs primarily outside the classroom affects college students' understanding of science. Collaborative learning is particularly important for the increasing number of nontraditional students who have limited time available for study groups and other peer learning activities occurring outside of class time. Using a national study of 4,644 college students of various academic majors, multiple linear regression was used to identify variables that enhance science learning. Time spent in peer learning settings, such as teaching science to peers and discussing science with peers, were the strongest predictors of understanding science; moreover, this finding was consistent even for nontraditional students who reported less frequency of engagement in such activities. The study suggests that science educators can enhance learning when they structure their courses to include peer learning that engages students with each other over science issues outside the classroom.

AB  - Written in response to criticism of our work by Fouad Abd-El-Khalick, this position paper reaffirms and reinforces our position about the need to broaden and enrich the scope of nature of science (NOS) oriented curricula by exposing students to the voices of practising scientists. While Abd-El-Khalick's motivation for promoting the so-called consensus view of NOS is rooted in issues of assessment (or "benchmarking", as he calls it), we argue that the major reason for teaching about NOS is its contribution to what Shen calls civic and cultural scientific literacy. We are critical of the consensus view for its philosophical naivety, failure to reflect contemporary scientific practice and potential for confusing students, and we re-state our view that it is important to expose students to a diversity of practice among the sub-disciplines of science. We argue that richer NOS understanding and a more authentic view of scientific practice can be achieved through direct and indirect contact with scientists at the cutting edge of research and development, which we characterise as learning about scientists, learning from scientists and learning with scientists.

AB  - The nature of nanoscience and nanotechnology (collectively, nano) are discussed as important examples of the modern sciences and technologies that are having an increasing impact on all aspects of life. In this Position paper, general proposals are made for the levels of understanding of nano that might be attained by whole populations. The ideas that should be addressed in those levels of understanding are reviewed. The scope and limitations of formal and informal avenues to the attainment of such understanding are outlined. Proposals are made for the aspects of nano that are best conveyed by the different media available for informal provision and illustrated from the scant documentation of contemporary practice. Last, some substantial issues for further research and development are identified.

AB  - The integration of agricultural and science curricular content that capitalizes on natural and inherent connections represents a challenge for secondary agricultural educators. The purpose of this case study was to create information about the employment of Cooperative Learning Groups (CLG) to enhance the science integrating learning objectives utilized in secondary agriculture programs. The objectives of the study were to determine if CLGs were an effective means for increasing: a) the number of science integrating learning objectives utilized in agriculture courses; and b) the number of science integrating learning objectives that require higher levels of cognitive processing in agriculture courses. Overall, the findings revealed that the CLG process lead to an increase in the total number of science integrating learning objectives and an increase in the number of science integrating learning objectives that require higher levels of cognition. Matched-sample t tests revealed that the increases in the number of science integrating learning objectives and objectives that require higher levels of cognition were statistically significant. It is recommended that researchers investigate methods for improving the specification, revision, and implementation of science integrating learning objectives used to guide student learning experiences in secondary agricultural programs of study.
