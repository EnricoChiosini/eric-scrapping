AB  - The complexity of the world's current grand challenges demands interdisciplinary approaches. The education of future scientists must cross the silos of the traditional disciplines; however, there is still a strong reluctance to tear such walls down. Here, we describe an integrative chemical biology course focused on epigenetics that strives to bring research culture to chemistry and biology Master's students. The course, which has been successfully implemented for the past two years, combines three modules: lectures, discovery-based research lab, and science communication. Importantly, the outline of our course design could be easily adapted to different fields, improving the synergy between research and teaching in our universities.

AB  - This article provides a case study of student experiences working as part of an interdisciplinary research team. A team of graduate-level students from social work, civil engineering, and computer science collaborated on the design of a mobile device application that captures data regarding how transportation disadvantage affects the lived experiences of community-dwelling older adults and single parents experiencing homelessness with dependent children. An online survey (N=5) was used to assess student experiences on the team. Findings from this case study have important implications for engaging students in interdisciplinary applied research, including challenging them to expand their knowledge base beyond the traditional confines of their disciplines, encouraging critical and creative thinking skills, and harnessing technology for the greater social good.

AB  - This laboratory exercise integrates chemistry and biology concepts to give third/fourth-year undergraduate students an opportunity to apply knowledge from different subject areas to address a real-world biomedical issue such as pathogen inhibition using composite materials. It involves the preparation of a bacteria-derived cellulosic biopolymer through microbial cultivation, impregnation of the bacterial cellulose(BC) with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), followed by the analysis of the materials and the antimicrobial properties of the biomaterial-AgNPs composites. The methods are relatively simple and use inexpensive chemicals. A Tollens type approach is adopted to produce silver nanoparticles-bacterial cellulose (AgNPs-BC) composites by the reduction of [Ag­(NH[subscript 3])[subscript 2]]+ complex embedded in the cellulose matrix. The samples were dried by two different methods: freeze-drying or vacuum-drying. The dried AgNPs-BC films were evaluated for antimicrobial properties against a test organism, in this example, "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", a Gram-negative biosafety containment level 2 (BSL 2) bacterium, using an agar diffusion test. For additional flexibility and customization, options for dividing the chemistry/biology content of this laboratory into smaller units with an emphasis on characterization techniques of nanomaterials for chemistry majors are also discussed.

AB  - The history and philosophy of science (HPS) plays a special role in education. An elective HPS course on the philosophy of scientific experimentation for young scientists and graduate students of natural science is presented. The course bears a pragmatic character, and its main aims include the development of critical thinking (CT), familiarization with philosophical problems in the relevant areas of knowledge, and the cultivation of a taste for reflective, critical analysis, both individual and group based, which contributes to a deeper understanding of the features of scientific practice in the context of modern complex group cooperation. Students are offered a classical HPS program that included debates on the relationship between empiricism and rationalism, the role of Kant's transcendental philosophy, modern topics associated with the practical success of rationalism in the emergence of modern natural science, and the theory-ladenness of experimentation. Particular attention during the course is paid to the problems of megascience, the inclusion of which is justified by the specifics of the students' engagement with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Emphasis is placed on the structure and typology of the collective subject in the modern educational process as well as in experimental practice. Lessons on the methodology of expert text analysis (META), which are aimed at the development of critical thinking skills and the creation of an interdisciplinary discussion space, are included in the course and relied on the example of the history and philosophy of high-energy physics to motivate professional reflection. META classes included in the course prepare graduate students for teamwork in big science, proto-megascience, and megascience. The course offers practical recommendations that could be applied to students' own research and could be useful for practitioners.

AB  - User Experience Design (UXD) is an often-neglected area of the information systems (IS) curriculum. UXD classes specifically designed for IS students are still uncommon in IS programs and this study aims to add to the body of knowledge to prepare a more well-rounded future generation of IS professionals. With this goal in mind, this study describes the redesign of an introductory UXD course following Kolb's learning cycle and constructivist instructional models. This paper describes the implementation of the supporting pedagogy and the opportunity for students to better master core UXD concepts. UXD, a multi-disciplinary area is built on skills learned in systems analysis and design class while students learn to apply relevant concepts through a hands-on, instructor-led, individual, in-class sample project. The skills are then applied by engaging students in active learning in a team setting to deliver value to a local organization by solving related, real-life challenges. Students work on community-engaged team projects to enhance their appreciation of the impact and relevance of their semester-long project deliverable. Constructivism guides the instructional models of the framework, in which problem-based learning is used to help students build and apply relevant skills. The instructional models and implications for instructional design are discussed along with a proposed pedagogical approach, course setting and structure, tools and techniques engaged, student feedback analyzed, and lessons learned.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted students' motivation for learning. As students return to schools in the post-pandemic era, their motivation for learning continues to deteriorate due to challenges in adapting to the new educational norms. This study aimed to enhance the motivation of secondary school students towards learning chemistry, particularly during the period when their motivation has tended to be low upon returning to regular schooling after the pandemic. To achieve this objective, the researchers developed and implemented a self-designed game-based learning approach called STEM-PT Traveler during lessons focused on the periodic table. STEM-PT Traveler incorporated elements of enjoyable learning and play, introducing an interdisciplinary perspective to periodic table lessons. The effectiveness of STEM-PT Traveler in improving motivation was compared to an alternative student-centred, non-game-based learning approach using an explanatory mixed-method design. Two intact classes from a public secondary school were randomly assigned to two groups--one group utilized the game-based learning approach (N = 45), while the other group employed the non-game-based approach (N = 46). The multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) findings from pre-test and post-test questionnaires administered before and after treatment revealed significant differences in overall motivation and in the subscales of intrinsic motivation, career motivation, and self-efficacy. Non-significant differences were observed for grade motivation and self-determination. Qualitative interviews conducted with both groups after the treatment provided additional insights into the questionnaire outcomes. Specifically, during the interviews, students highlighted that the game facilitated engagement with the periodic table elements due to their intrinsic value. Additionally, the game provided a career perspective and instilled a belief that excelling in chemistry is instrumental. This study suggests that a game-based approach is an effective alternative to the predominantly used teacher-centred teaching of the periodic table and advocates for the integration of interdisciplinary perspectives into lessons on the Periodic Table.

AB  - In an attempt to address declining persistence rates of university STEM majors (Science, Teaching, Engineering, and Math), concerns regarding retention rates and waning STEM faculty participation in faculty development, we report on a year-long professional development program called the STEM Professional Academy to Reinvigorate the Culture of Teaching (SPARCT) that focuses on evidence-based teaching practices. Expected SPARCT outcomes include: (1) improving evidence-based practices in the introductory STEM classroom, (2) developing professional peer-observation strategies for the STEM classroom, (3) enhancing scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) by SPARCT faculty, (4) developing long-term Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs) in STEM instruction, and (5) enhancing student learning in introductory STEM courses. In this article, we describe the features of SPARCT and discuss findings from our first three years as aligned with the outcomes over three cohorts of SPARCT participants (2014-2016). By engaging at least 25% of Florida Gulf Coast University's STEM faculty during the three years, SPARCT is creating a community of STEM scholars with self-efficacy in using evidence-based teaching practices, reinvigorating interdisciplinary connections, developing learning threads, and increasing the community's potential to transform the teaching culture of the university.

AB  - In a three-year, practice-based, creative research project, the team designed a video game for undergraduate biology students that aimed to find the right balance between educational content and entertainment. The project involved 7 faculty members and 14 undergraduate students from biological science, design, computer science, and music. This nontraditional approach to research was attractive to students. Working on an interdisciplinary practice-based research project required strategies related to timeline, recruitment, funding, team management, and mentoring. Although this project was time-consuming and full of challenges, it created meaningful learning experiences not only for students but also for faculty members.

AB  - On graduation, teacher candidates (TCs) are typically underprepared to teach science, particularly physical science, whereas physics graduates frequently lack training in teaching or effective communication. In response, we created two models for interdisciplinary peer learning where TCs were paired with either graduate or undergraduate physics students. In both models, physics students teach TCs content knowledge relevant to a given area of either classical or quantum physics, which TCs then use to design and implement a short lesson for K-5 students. Overall, both models were successful, with the two sets of students reporting benefits in each case. Affordances for TCs included increased confidence to teach physical science and an appreciation for collaboration with experts. Physics students described increased awareness of the complexities of communicating science to general audiences and stronger community with their classmates. Students from both groups cited insufficient project time as a constraint, whereas physics students found it challenging to align their project and coursework. In moving away from traditional lecture, these interdisciplinary collaborations also benefitted us as instructors, giving us new perspectives on teaching. In light of our findings we propose improvements to these proof-of-concept models to enable their future scale-up and replication in other disciplines.

AB  - Contemporary research into science education has generally been conducted from the perspective of "conceptual change" in learning. This study sought to extend previous work by recognizing that human rationality can be influenced by the emotions generated by the learning environment and specific actions related to learning. Methods used in educational psychology were adopted to investigate the emotional experience of science students as affected by gender, teaching methods, feedback, and learning tasks. A multidisciplinary research approach combining brain activation measurement with multivariate psychological data theory was employed in the development of a questionnaire intended to reveal the academic emotions of university students in three situations: attending science class, learning scientific subjects, and problem solving. The reliability and validity of the scale was evaluated using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Results revealed differences between the genders in positive-activating and positive-deactivating academic emotions in all three situations; however, these differences manifested primarily during preparation for Science tests. In addition, the emotions experienced by male students were more intense than those of female students. Finally, the negative-deactivating emotions associated with participation in Science tests were more intense than those experienced by simply studying science. This study provides a valuable tool with which to evaluate the emotional response of students to a range of educational situations.

AB  - Due to its haptic and interactive nature, virtual anatomy provides an opportunity for small-group learning, enabling students to develop their group work skills before they graduate. However, there is currently little practical guidance supported by pedagogic principles detailing how to incorporate it into curricula. Anatomy educators at the University of Plymouth conducted action research aiming to capture students' overall perceptions of the virtual anatomy platform Anatomage. Questioning the benefits and challenges students face while interacting with Anatomage prompted the creation of evidence-based interventions to be later evaluated. Although a plethora of themes were identified, this report specifically examines those relating to group work. Thematic analysis of initial focus group data found group size and group dynamics impacted students' experience with the platform. Following the implementation of interventions to resolve these issues, a questionnaire and second series of focus groups were conducted to determine whether they were successful. Additional subthemes found from these data included facilitation, social pressure, peer learning and working with friends. This study contributed to the improvement of small group learning and integration of virtual anatomy into curricula based on student and staff feedback. As such, these data support the development of effective group working skills which are fundamental for healthcare professionals and widely recognized by regulators such as the General Medical Council and Health and Care Professions Council. In this report, the authors provide practical advice informed by pedagogy and principles from management and psychology to provide a multidisciplinary perspective.

AB  - Creating explanations is an important process for students, not only to make connections between novel information and background knowledge, but also to be able to communicate their understanding of any given topic. This article explores students' explanations in the context of computational science and engineering, an important interdisciplinary field that enables scientists and engineers to solve complex problems. Specifically, this study explores: (a) students' approaches to create written explanations of programing code and (b) the relationship between students' explanations and their ability to do computer programing. Students wrote in-code comments for 3 MATLAB® worked-examples, which were qualitatively analyzed using a coding scheme. Different approaches to self-explain were identified using hierarchical cluster analysis, and differences in students' ability to do computer programing were identified using analysis of variance. The resulting approaches to self-explain were: original solution, mechanistic, principle-based, limited, and goal-based. The findings suggest that experienced students wrote simple in-code comments to self-explain, but students with lower ability to do computer programing wrote more comprehensive explanations, as they may take this as a learning opportunity.

AB  - There is a growing demand for degreed science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) professionals, but the production of degreed STEM students is not keeping pace. Problems exist at every juncture along the pipeline. Too few students choose to major in STEM disciplines. Many of those who do major in STEM drop out or change majors. Females and minorities remain underrepresented in STEM. The success rate of college students who are from low-income background or first-generation students is much lower than that of students who do not face such challenges. Some of those who successfully complete their degree need help in making the transition to the workforce after graduation. A program at Lamar University takes a multidisciplinary approach to addressing these problems. It is designed to recruit, retain and transition undergraduates to careers in STEM, focusing its efforts on five science disciplines and on these "at-risk" students. The program was supported by a 5-year grant from the National Science Foundation and is supported through August 31, 2016 by Lamar University and a grant from ExxonMobil. A formal assessment plan documents the program's success. The program received an award from the Texas Higher Education Board for its contributions towards Closing the Gaps in Higher Education in Texas. This paper describes the program's theoretical framework, research questions, methods, evaluation plan, and instruments. It presents an analysis of the results achieved using these methods and implications for improvements to the program resulting from lessons learned.

AB  - In many countries around the world, there has been an increasing emphasis on improving science education. Recent reform efforts in the USA call for teachers to integrate scientific and engineering practices into science teaching; for example, science teachers are asked to provide learning experiences for students that apply crosscutting concepts (e.g., patterns, scale) and increase understanding of disciplinary core ideas (e.g., physical science, earth science). Engineering practices and engineering design are essential elements of this new vision of science teaching and learning. This paper presents a research study that evaluates the effects of an engineering design-based science curriculum on student learning and attitudes. Three middle school life science teachers and 275 seventh grade students participated in the study. Content assessments and attitude surveys were administered before and after the implementation of the curriculum unit. Statewide mathematics test proficiency scores were included in the data analysis as well. Results provide evidence of the positive effects of implementing the engineering design-based science unit on student attitudes and learning.

AB  - How do cultural heritage scientists and art conservators identify pigments and other painting media in a decorated object or painting, preferably without taking samples that could potentially damage the artwork? A major emphasis in the characterization, authentication, and conservation of works of art and cultural heritage objects is the use of multifaceted, noninvasive analytical methods whenever and wherever possible. In recent years, the development of portable, hand-held, noninvasive spectrometers and the widespread availability of standard spectroscopic databases that allow for the comparison and identification of newly acquired spectra have assisted scientists and conservators in this endeavor. According to their Web site, the Cultural Heritage Science Open-Source (CHSOS) "is a private practice service specialized in on-site examination and documentation of works of art with technical photography and analytical techniques that also provides related training and consulting for private professionals and institutions. CHSOS clients are art collectors, museums, and private professionals, such as conservators, art historians, and art appraisers." Fortunately, for chemistry educators interested in the spectroscopic characterization and identification of pigments, CHSOS has provided freely available, readily downloadable spectroscopic data for 81 historical and 66 modern pigments using five spectroscopic methods capable of noninvasive analysis (diffuse UV-vis-NIR reflectance, X-ray fluorescence, Raman, near-infrared, and Fourier transform infrared). This article describes the construction and features of three Vernier Software Logger "Pro" databases that incorporate the CHSOS spectroscopic data from historical pigments and presents four classroom activities that allow students to utilize the databases to develop and apply their knowledge of spectroscopy to identify pigments.

AB  - During a classroom-based study, Grade 4 students were provided with multiple opportunities to develop their visual meaning-making skills and competences, as well as their aesthetic understanding of and critical thinking about multimodal texts. Intentionally designed instruction during the research included a range of activities focused on specific elements of visual art and design. Student participants read and discussed, and wrote about selections of children's literature during Language Arts, Social Studies, and Science. "The Sea Book" was one of the books featured during an interdisciplinary unit on Ocean Literacy, a component of the overall case study research. Content analysis of the students' responses about the trade book revealed their capacity to engage in five synergistic visual reading skills. As well, data analysis revealed how the students perceived, described, and interpreted the use of color, visual point of view, typography, framing and line in Milner's artwork as fulfilling multiple, and often concomitant, meaning-making purposes. The findings demonstrated that instruction about how to read and understand visual representations can enhance students' knowledge and interpretation of content conveyed through multiple modes of representation, and develop students' capacity and agency for critically reading visual and multimodal texts.

AB  - Educational Data Mining (EDM) is an interdisciplinary field that encapsulates different fields such as computer science, education, and statistics. It is crucial to make data mining in education to shape future trends in education for policymakers, researchers, and educators in terms of developments. To have an all-inclusive understanding of EDM studies, a comprehensive examination of both the intellectual and social structure of the field with a global perspective and its evolution over time is required to provide adequate comprehension of the past, present, and as well future research direction for this research field. In this respect, this research study aims to explore the performance analysis of the EDM, the intellectual structure of the EDM, the social structure of the area, and the temporal modeling of the EDM through bibliometric analysis. In this bibliometric analysis, the existing body of knowledge that covered 2010-2021 was presented on educational data mining to provide future directions in the field of education. The results of the study showed the number of publications increased by 1325% (8 to 114) over the years. It has been determined that the most influential journals in the field are "Computers & Education", "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications" and "Educational Technology & Society" and the most influential authors are "C. Romero", "S. Ventura" and "R.S. Barker", and the USA, Spain, and China seem to be the most influential countries in the field of EDM. The themes of "CLASSIFICATION" and "SYSTEMS" in the first sub-period (2010-2013) of EDM, and "LEARNING ANALYTICS", "PREDICTION OF ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE" and "SOCIAL MEDIA" in the second sub-term (2014-2017) and the third and last sub-period (2018-2021), "PREDICTION OF ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE", "MACHINE LEARNING", "PROCESS MINING", "PARTICIPATION", "KNN", "J48" and "BAYESIAN NETWORK" themes were identified as engine themes. In addition, as a result of the thematic evolution map, it was discovered that the themes "DEEP-LEARNING (DL)" and "EMOTION" are emerging themes for future studies for shaping the future of education based on sustainable goals.

AB  - The mass shift to Open-Book, Open-Web (OBOW) assessments during the pandemic highlighted new opportunities in Higher Education for developing accessible, authentic assessments that can reduce administrative load. Despite a plethora of research emerging on the effectiveness of OBOW assessments within disciplines, few currently evaluate their effectiveness across disciplines where the assessment instrument can vary significantly. This paper aims to evaluate the experience students across STEM subjects had of OBOW exams to contribute to an evidence-base for emerging post-pandemic assessment policies and strategies. In April 2021, following two cycles of OBOW exams, we surveyed STEM students across a range of subjects to determine their preparation strategy, experiences during the exam, perception of development of higher order cognitive skills, test anxiety, and how they thought these assessments might enhance employability. Overall, students from subjects that use assessment instruments requiring analytical, quantitative-based answers (Maths, Physics, Computer Science and Chemistry) adapted their existing study skills less effectively, felt less prepared and experienced higher levels of stress compared to students of subjects using more qualitative discursive based answers (Biosciences and Geography). We conclude with recommendations on how to enhance the use of OBOW exams: these include supporting and developing more effective study skills, ensuring assessments align with intended learning outcomes, addressing the issue of academic integrity, promoting inclusivity, and encouraging authentic assessment. Based on the outcomes of this study, we strongly advise that assessment policies that foster the whole-scale roll-out of OBOW assessment consider the inter-disciplinary impacts on learner development, staff training and workload resources.

AB  - This book contains the full text of papers and posters presented at the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2024), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (WIARS). Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2024 received 729 submissions, from more than 50 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. The conference accepted for presentation 284 submissions (39% acceptance rate). This is the Volume 1 of the book titled Education and New Developments 2024, that showcases the outcomes of dedicated research and developments undertaken by authors who are driven by their passion to enhance research methods that directly relate to teaching, learning, and the practical applications of education in the present day. Within its pages, you will find a diverse array of contributors and presenters who expand our perspectives by delving into various educational matters. This first volume focuses on the main areas of TEACHERS AND STUDENTS and TEACHING AND LEARNING.

AB  - Contribution: A technical course in a multidisciplinary university program has to provide high-level skills, with limited lecturing hours and student background. This article investigates the principles for its design and reports about a study case. Background: The overall course organization needs to address specific learning targets and teaching techniques, different from those used in traditional courses on the topic. Research Question: A stepwise strategy assists a principled design that allows dynamic, long-term improvements. Methodology: The evaluation of its applicability requires a years-long record of historical data. The article studies the evolution of a course over six years using simple monitoring techniques: surveys and rubric-based examinations. Findings: Monitoring emerges as an essential feature for course evolution: a focused examination provides the best results, while institutional, wide-spectrum surveys appear to be of little help.

AB  - Health professionals and policymakers are asking educators to place more emphasis on food and nutrition education. Integrating these topics into science curricula using hand-on, food-based activities may strengthen students' understanding of science concepts. The Food, Math, and Science Teaching Enhancement Resource (FoodMASTER) Initiative is a compilation of programs aimed at using food as a tool to teach mathematics and science. Previous studies have shown that students experiencing the FoodMASTER curriculum were very excited about the activities, became increasingly interested in the subject matter of food, and were able to conduct scientific observations. The purpose of this study was to: (1) assess 4th graders food-related multidisciplinary science knowledge, and (2) compare gains in food-related science knowledge after implementation of an integrated, food-based curriculum. During the 2009-2010 school year, FoodMASTER researchers implemented a hands-on, food-based intermediate curriculum in eighteen 4th grade classrooms in Ohio ("n" = 9) and North Carolina ("n" = 9). Sixteen classrooms in Ohio ("n" = 8) and North Carolina ("n" = 8), following their standard science curricula, served as comparison classrooms. Students completed a researcher-developed science knowledge exam, consisting of 13 multiple-choice questions administered pre-and post-test. Only subjects with pre-and post-test scores were entered into the sample (Intervention n = 343; Control n = 237). No significant differences were observed between groups at pre-test. At post-test, the intervention group scored (9.95 ± 2.00) significantly higher (p = 0.000) than the control group (8.84 ± 2.37) on a 13-point scale. These findings suggest the FoodMASTER intermediate curriculum is more effective than a standard science curriculum in increasing students' multidisciplinary science knowledge related to food.

AB  - The increasing importance of continuingly complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) challenges and encourages universities worldwide to organize up-to-date CPS oriented educational programs. The Erasmus+ project "CybPhys" aims to support CPS oriented educational programs in Belarus and Ukraine. We put forward a hypothesis that the educational situation, training opportunities, situation of the labor market, and general economic development are related to each other and can vary depending on the region. In order to validate our hypothesis and to provide input to curricula modernizations, an in-depth study in the form of surveys was conducted in the years 2019-2020. The results of the study showed that the differences between the perceptions of stakeholders in different regions of one country were more significant than the deviations between the global evaluation marks obtained from Belarusian and Ukrainian respondents. In order to increase the synergy of the CybPhys partners, the transdisciplinary and T-shape skills approaches are introduced to the education programs of the partner's universities. An innovative ICT based teaching and learning environment and associated teaching methodologies will be developed. The research provides valuable input to the development of industry and research-oriented cross-domain study programs in Cyber-Physical Systems focused on the needs of Belarusian and Ukrainian industries.

AB  - We describe the impact of a hybrid Earth and space science course, taught online and complemented by a 2-hour face-to-face lab, on the science teaching self-efficacy of elementary preservice teachers over a 3-year span. Guided by the two overarching objectives of engaging students in the content and increasing their comfort level with teaching science, we designed and implemented a writing-to-learn assignment on the importance of science teaching (for four semesters) and a lesson plan with demonstration on common children's misconceptions in Earth and space science (for two semesters). In the last two semesters, the specific assignment was dropped to accommodate increased enrollment. Pre- and post-STEBI-B (Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument) results show a consistent increase in the students' personal science teaching efficacy scores and no change in the students' science teaching outcome expectancy scores that did not change when the semester-long assignment was dropped. Content learning, as measured using the average scores of four proctored exams and final course grades, was also independent of the type of activity and its presence or absence. These results suggest that a hybrid Earth and space science course is a viable mechanism to improve the personal self-efficacy for science teaching of this cohort of students.

AB  - In 2000, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study was conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). It is a worldwide study of 15-year-old students' performance in mathematics, science and reading skills. The study showed relatively poor results for German students' scientific literacy (Prenzel et al., 2001). Although the 2009 PISA study reported that these competencies had improved, there is still a demand in the German education system for the development of methods to improve student performance (Rönnebeck et al., 2010). In the light of this evidence, interdisciplinary teaching (IdT) is often considered to be a useful strategy. IdT is acknowledged as a form of education that is able to impart cross-linked and relevant knowledge to students beyond the bounds of individual disciplines (Ministerium für Schule und Weiterbildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen, 1999). This article presents two studies examining IdT's effectiveness in biology and physical education (PE) in the sixth form. This realisation of IdT has not yet been investigated by other studies. The two studies intend to answer the question "Does IdT support the students' skills and knowledge concerning practical application and problem solving better than subject-based teaching?" The first study was conducted with six courses and 141 students, and the second study had six courses and 206 students. Both were conducted for 3 hours a week for a period of 6 weeks. In order to compare effectiveness with that of regular lessons, the studies used a so-called test and control group design. This means that a test group took part in IdT lessons as mentioned above while a control group of peers received "regular" teaching as separate subjects. The effect of different lessons on the students' skills could then be compared. The findings of the studies indicate that there was an improvement in the test groups' knowledge, transfer and problem-solving skills as well as assessment skills in comparison with the control groups. Thus, the effectiveness of IdT units in biology and PE was demonstrated in these two studies. The realisation of the IdT concept presented in this article may function as an inspiration for teachers to use cross-disciplinary teaching units in their everyday teaching.

AB  - The article is aimed at describing one of the possible interdisciplinary courses for students of the 7-9 classes of the basic school connecting mathematics with natural sciences and the study of such courses role in the formation and development of meta-subject competencies of students. The leading method for this is the modeling of interdisciplinary courses, the main tools for the development of meta-subject competence in which are the interdisciplinary character of the content, including open and partially open type tasks in the course structure and the organization of project activities of schoolchildren in the field of studying mathematics and related disciplines. As a result of the research conducted by the authors they worked out several author's interdisciplinary courses, among them a special place is taken by the course "Mathematics in Natural sciences" for the classes of the natural-science profile. It is suggested in it to consider mathematical questions when applying them to the material of related disciplines both through the study of theoretical material and in the process of solving problems, including the open type, and involving schoolchildren in the project of interdisciplinary activity. Practical use of the interdisciplinary courses allows to see the achievements of meta-subject results by schoolchildren and the successes of students both in mathematical preparation, expressed by high marks on the subject, and related disciplines, which indicates the improvement of mathematical education quality of students who received training using the proposed methodology.

AB  - In order to be well-educated citizens in the 21st century, children need to learn computing in school. However, implementing computing education in schools faces several practical problems, such as a lack of computing teachers and time in an already overloaded curriculum. A solution may be a multidisciplinary approach, integrating computing education within other subjects in the curriculum. The present study proposes an instructional unit for computing education in social studies classes, with students learning basic computing concepts, including computational thinking, by programming history related games using Scratch. The instructional unit is developed following an instructional design approach and is applied and evaluated through a pilot case study in four classes (5th and 7th grade) with a total of 105 students at a school in (omitted for submission). Results provide a first indication that the instructional unit enables the learning of basic computing concepts (specifically programming) in an efficient, effective and entertaining way increasing also the interest and motivation of students to learn computing.

AB  - There are subjects which university students perceive as uninteresting and which they are reluctant to learn. The use of an appropriate approach to learning can contribute to the formation of positive students' opinions on learning. Project-based learning (PjBL) is characterized by active research, problem-solving, and student-made projects which is nowdays usually facilitated by the use of computer and network technologies. The aim of this research is to assess opinions of students of physics and technology at University of Novi Sad, Republic of Serbia, on PjBL, as well as to analyze these opinions in connection to three different factors: gender, academic performance, and study program. The physics content "Diffusion and Osmosis" was realized using PjBL. This topic was chosen because of possible interdisciplinary concepts' relations between physics, chemistry, and biology. After students' group work on projects and their project reports, a survey was conducted. Research results showed that opinions of students participating in the research about PjBL were independent of their gender, academic performance, as well as whether they study physics or technology. All students had equally positive opinions on PjBL. Further implementation of PjBL is planned in the authors' departments, along with the integrative implementation of PjBL in teaching science in collaboration with other departments at the university.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely adopted in higher education. However, the current research on AI in higher education is limited lacking both breadth and depth. The present study fills the research gap by exploring faculty members' perception on teaching AI and data science related courses facilitated by an open experiential AI platform. Specifically, two focus groups are conducted among computer science and non-computer science faculty members to gauge their perception on the integration of AI in an experiential learning platform to teach data science, as well as their perception on AI powered data science curriculum in higher education. Findings reveal three major themes which are defining data science, assembling interdisciplinary teams, and building platform for connection. The study has both theoretical and practical implications.

AB  - So far, not enough effort has been invested in developing reliable, valid, and engaging assessments in school science, especially assessment of interdisciplinary science based on the new Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Furthermore, previous tools rely mostly on multiple-choice items and evaluation of student outcome is linked only to their raw scores in standardized tests. In addition, educational research on student science achievement always limits in certain grade/subject according to application of raw scores. This study provides a way to design, validate, and further improve an instrument to assess student understanding in interdisciplinary science across grade and time. Meanwhile, student learning growth is investigated. The data are collected from elementary/middle school student survey from an Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Partnership (ISEP) in Northeastern part of the USA. The results show a generally good quality of instrument through various aspects of empirical evidence, such as dimensionality, model-data-fit, and validity. Finally, student learning growth in understanding interdisciplinary science shows a sharp increase between elementary and middle school. The study sheds light on developing more reliable and valid instruments in assessing student science understanding based on the new standards and it also provides suggestions of implementation in both educational research and practice.

AB  - Computer programming provides a framework for interdisciplinary learning in sciences, arts and languages. However, increasing integration of programming in K--12 shows that the block-based and text-based dichotomy of programming environments does not reflect the spectrum of their affordance. Hence, educators are confronted with a fundamental hurdle of matching programming environments with learners' cognitive abilities and learning objectives. This study addresses this challenge by analyzing 111 articles evaluating the affordances of programming environments to identify both structural and theoretical models to support educators' choice of programming environments. The following dimensions of programming environments were identified: connectivity mode, interface natural language, language inheritance, age appropriateness, cost of environment, output interface, input interface, and project types. For each of these dimensions, the synthesis of the literature ranged from examining its nature and effect on learning programming to the implications of choosing an environment and the critical gaps that future studies should address. The findings offer instructors useful parameters to compare and assess programming environments' suitability and alignment with learning objectives.

AB  - Preparing science and engineering students to work in interdisciplinary teams necessitates research on teaching and learning of interdisciplinary thinking. A multidimensional approach was taken to examine student interdisciplinary learning in a master course on food quality management. The collected 615 student experiences were analysed for the cognitive, emotional, and social learning dimensions using the learning theory of Illeris. Of these 615 experiences, the analysis showed that students reported 214, 194, and 207 times on, respectively, the emotional, the cognitive, and the social dimension. Per learning dimension, key learning experiences featuring interdisciplinary learning were identified such as "frustrations in selecting and matching disciplinary knowledge to complex problems" ("emotional"), "understanding how to apply theoretical models or concepts to real-world situations" ("cognitive"), and "socially engaging with peers to recognise similarities in perceptions and experiences" ("social"). Furthermore, the results showed that students appreciated the cognitive dimension relatively more than the emotional and social dimensions.

AB  - Systematic analysis of undergraduate curriculum design and assessment is required to ensure real world experiences are embedded in a degree structure for a high level of information literacy (IL) attainment. IL competencies and skills are critical for successful graduate outcomes. We developed a framework using a constructive alignment approach to develop the Student Attributes for Information Literacy (SAIL) and accompanying rubric with outcomes that categorize depth of application over degree progression. The rubric was used to audit IL in core units of a multidisciplinary Bachelor of Environmental Science degree before and after a cycle of curriculum design. SAIL's rubric provides educators with a practical and repeatable approach to identifying IL development in units of learning. The SAIL rubric found that IL, for most core units, was taught, practiced, and assessed at the foundational level. At the advanced level, however, students had limited opportunities for literacy training, practice, and assessment in a digital context until the end of the degree. The framework and rubric identified gaps and opportunities in IL attainment, and thus warrants further application. Making sure these gaps are addressed, with opportunities identified for learning throughout a progressive program, will ensure resilient and adaptable graduates in a digital dominant workforce.

AB  - While the majority of STEM persistence has focused on outcomes for first-year students, there has been little investigation into the outcomes for peer mentors. Of the studies conducted, results are promising. Benefits for peer mentors include a change in their perceptions on teaching and learning; an improvement in their communication, presentation, and leadership skills; and an increase in their understanding of the course content. However, one of the main limitations of these studies is their small sample sizes. Many of the studies purport sample sizes of 5 to 30 peer mentors. The purpose of this article is to overview, from the perspective of the mentors, a university-wide interdisciplinary peer mentoring program for first-year students enrolled in key gateway courses (Calculus I, Physics I, and Chemistry I). Each year over 1,000 undergraduate students participated in the program and were served by approximately 136 peer mentors. The program was monitored by an advisory committee comprising an interdisciplinary team of faculty, university staff, program staff, and an outside consultant. This article examined mentor outcomes and included the data from over 300 mentors.

AB  - Twenty years into the millennium, the world has been confronted with a pandemic that has had an immeasurable impact on the workplace, learning environment and related technologies. Technology and technological advancements are founded on three disciplines, namely Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science. Internationally, an integration of the curricula of these disciplines are promoted in the education space, as an effective way to achieve 21st century capabilities that lately includes computational thinking. This study explores the changes in the content and alignment of the three subjects in the South African secondary school system from an interdisciplinary framework perspective. Textbooks, curriculum documents and planning calendars provided the information for the content analysis. The content in Physics and Mathematics have remained basically the same, with a few topics removed from Physics and some added to Mathematics. Information Technology has replaced Computer Science, with significant changes in content in alignment with developments in computing technology. No clear indication of an alignment between the disciplines could be found, which, to a certain extent, puts South Africa outside the international frame. The basic education system appears to run an assessment-driven curriculum in Mathematics, Physical Sciences and Information Technology. This system produces poor results and seemingly does not allow for interdisciplinary skills development.

AB  - The scientific production of digital literacy at the university level published in the Scopus database is analyzed, with a special emphasis on studies on tourism due to the relevance of information and communication technology (ICT) in said professional sector. For this, a bibliometric study of a pertinent sample is undertaken using a mixed methodology and based on a series of variables related to formal and content aspects. The last variable, reserved for the academic field under study, directly addresses the main objective as regards tourism. The results show a great global and multidisciplinary interest in digital literacy (DL), mainly from students. There is also a parallel between the integration of ICT into society and the growing evolution of case studies, as well as little interest in their development in specific areas such as tourism studies. Despite good results in general terms, the lack of specialization poses challenges that require greater involvement of training institutions in the sense of providing future professionals with the necessary tools to face them successfully, especially in sectors such as tourism where ICTs are a key piece.

AB  - The primary purpose is the implementation of the interdisciplinary approach to understanding and the construction of integrative models of understanding literary texts. The interdisciplinary methodological paradigm of studying text understanding, based on the principles of various sciences facilitating the identification of the text understanding essence (cognitive, anthropocentric, dialogue, interdisciplinary principles) is rationalized and described. Methods of various sciences are used in complex: the hermeneutic method (hermeneutic philosophy, hermeneutic psychology), the pragmatic understanding method (pragmatics), the cognitive analysis, the inference method (cognitive linguistics), the discourse analysis method (discourse linguistics) and the modelling method. A literary text understanding integrative model is offered which can be applied during the analysis of various types of texts and their interpretation. The research proves that the interdisciplinary approach facilitates the development of an integrative multilevel model of text understanding, on each level of which, knowledge required to ensure understanding is characterized and disciplines are indicated.

AB  - Coding is increasingly recognized as a new literacy that should be encouraged at a young age. This understanding has recontextualized computer science as a compulsory school subject and has informed several developmentally appropriate approaches to computation, including for preschool children. This study focuses on the introduction of three approaches to computation in preschool (3-6 years), specifically computational thinking, programming, and robotics, from a cross-curricular perspective. This paper presents preliminary findings from one of the case studies currently being developed as part of project KML II-Laboratory of Technologies and Learning of Programming and Robotics for Preschool and Elementary School. The purpose of the KML II project is to characterize how approaches to computation can be integrated into preschool and elementary education, across different knowledge domains. The conclusions point to "expression and communication" as an initial framework for computational approaches in preschool, but also to multidisciplinary and more creative methodological activities that offer greater scope for the development of digital and computational competences, as well as for personal and social development.

AB  - Land Acknowledgements have become a ubiquitous part of universities. They purport to remember, honor, and bear witness to the future of Indigenous nations and to recognize the land and honor local Indigenous communities. While acknowledging the Indigenous peoples upon whose lands we work is an essential gesture, the authors join other scholars who argue that we must go beyond a mere statement. The Land Acknowledgement must also propel the learning community of the institution to take action, to embrace relationships with the environment (land), and to take responsibility for its care for Indigenous generations to come. Our attempts to recognize the importance of Indigenous epistemologies and commitments to the land have enriched the whole learning environment of the University. This report describes the interdisciplinary, collaborative approach we have been taking as we attempt to go beyond the mere performance of acknowledgement towards making substantive change. At the time of writing, the authors live on the traditional territories of the Hasinal and Wichita, Caddo, Comanche, and Cherokee Nations.

AB  - Students who engage in undergraduate research experiences acquire many benefits, including an understanding of how scientific knowledge is constructed, recognition that knowledge can be complex and uncertain, and the habit of viewing knowledge critically. This paper describes a first-year two-course sequence that provides multidisciplinary opportunities for international science students to engage in the research process and present at a student-led research conference. We describe course goals and structure, and discuss whether the goals were attained using instructor reflections, student performance, and student survey data. We also evaluate the impact of changes to the curriculum between Year 1 and Year 2. In both years, we found that students engaged meaningfully with the research process and began to understand how scientific knowledge is created. We also found that a modular model with front-end support worked better for instructors as compared to a continuous individualized project mentorship model. This modular approach involved structured pre- and post-class assignments within discipline-specific themes containing examples of the research process embedded into the discipline. These discipline-specific modules were followed by modules covering broader research process themes. We encourage instructors who are thinking of delivering a similar research-based course for first-year students to provide support via example research questions and other example templates for student submissions.

AB  - Undergraduate research experiences (UREs) that include interdisciplinary, engagement-oriented, and collaborative experiences have the potential to benefit students in unique ways. Through these innovative experiences, students are able to see the social impact and importance of their work--a factor known to strengthen the academic and career persistence of students traditionally underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. In the present study, students assumed simultaneous roles as students, interdisciplinary researchers, and community liaisons as they facilitated a community-engaged participatory research project. Using interpretive phenomenological analysis, we explore students' evolving perspectives of knowledge generation and social change processes before, during, and after the URE. Findings emphasize participants' altered views of the respective roles of academic researchers and community members in generating knowledge, the value of interdisciplinary research, and the potential of innovative UREs to foster positive change--in academic and community contexts.

AB  - Although it is not possible to predict the future, at least some ideas can be developed through planning. Geography focuses on current social, environmental and spatial problems; however, it should, at the same time, teach us to plan its future handling. At school, this is a responsible role for the subject geography. This article compares how nineteen different English and German (North Rhine-Westphalian) geography textbooks deal with planning through various tasks. These tasks are identified with a definition, based on a multidisciplinary literature review, and are examined by qualitative content analysis. It appears that planning skills for shaping the future are dealt with differently in both countries, with respect to branches of geography, topic of concern, planning method, time frame and perspectivity. Implications and limitations of the findings for geography teachers, international researchers in science education, publishing houses and other persons responsible for geography education programs are discussed.

AB  - Enterprise education is a policy-driven, cross-curricular phenomenon on many Western countries' educational agendas. The expectation is that it will be implemented in different school subjects, but bridging enterprise education and different school subjects has proven to be a challenge. This article explores whether and how open-ended investigations in science education in secondary schools can be viewed as a form of enterprise education. We identify several points of contact, illuminating the premises on which enterprise education can be integrated into science education. Thus, the results contribute to the under-researched field of bridging enterprise education with school subjects in secondary education.

AB  - In response to the globally escalating number of language learners tasked with learning science through a foreign language, this review seeks to bring new perspectives by reframing research findings, still dominated by historical language assumptions, through a contemporary language lens. We aim to unearth, amalgamate and expose the potentials of non-linguistic modes described by the theory of multiliteracies that appear sporadic and fragmentary within studies due to their linguistic focus, as we surmise they offer language learners alternative avenues for meaning-making. 40 peer-reviewed empirical studies published between 1995 and 2019 were systematically found and examined using theoretical thematic analysis to expand our understandings. We conjectured findings that appeared contingent upon non-linguistic modes but did not prominently feature in the reported results. In doing so, we used a multimodal and translanguaging lens from which three themes and educational implications emerged. The integration of non-linguistic modes in science: (1) aided language learners' science discourse, provided they had access to multiple modes and agency over expression; (2) facilitated multicultural learning communities validating each learner as a sense maker; and (3) promoted authentic and equitable learning experiences. Other noteworthy findings, such as the influence of the tactile mode, are discussed. Recommendations to future researchers include adopting epistemologies of language fitting to our century and developing transdisciplinary approaches to research.

AB  - This case addresses the critical topic in education of developing students' skills and capabilities associated with enterprise-level business intelligence systems and associated internal control concerns. The experiences of using a business intelligence,task-based activity in an interdisciplinary curriculum model are presented and discussed. Pedagogically, the task-based activity enhances perceived learning for both accounting and IS disciplines indomain (internal controls and IS development), communication (comprehension and creation), and critical thinking skills. Additionally, students appreciate the realism and active learning associated with the task-based activity delivered in an interdisciplinary curriculum model. The design of the task-based activity as a teaching resource allows other instructors, based on their requirements, to develop a lesson plan around using the activity as written, or focusing on the any of the many aspects of controls or technology presented.

AB  - This study proposes a narrative pedagogical model for creating and developing case studies that highlight the challenges and issues surrounding the megatrends of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, specifically "People and the Internet." This proposal, framed in an online learning environment, represents the second stage of an educational platform to guide university students in facilitating an ideathon to address the megatrends of the 4th Industrial Revolution. Designing a model for case study creation related to the megatrends aims to foster complex thinking in university students, especially innovative thinking, a sub-competency of complex thinking. Fostering complex thinking highlights the importance of cognitive, practical, and adaptive skills to address interdisciplinary challenges. The Design Process and Practice Methodology and the case study methodology facilitated the narrative case study design model. The outcome of this study is a tangible product that enriches the debates on education and complex systems thinking in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

AB  - This article reports a session from the virtual international 2021 IUBMB/ASBMB workshop, "Teaching Science on Big Data." The awareness of using publicly available research data sets for undergraduate training is low in certain parts of the world. Final year projects always revolve around wet-lab based projects. The challenges occur during COVID-19 pandemic when it forces full lockdown to the nation, but at the same time faculty members need to provide consistent training to the students and projects to work with. We aim to identify supervisors in the faculty that are ready to convert their proposed project from wet-lab to an online-based project. As coordinators of the course we created an online survey to identify projects that can be converted into dry-lab/online projects. Our surveys identified only 32.5% projects implemented dry-lab/online based projects. Most academicians described that they are not ready or familiar to apply changes for their research design. With the unknown future of the world living with COVID-19 and directional changes of life science research toward big data driven research indeed we should be ready to adopt such changes. Awareness on reusing public data sets as tools for research should be provided to strengthen undergraduate training. Life science undergraduates should be exposed to reusing public data sets as these materials are readily available case studies that allow in depth exploration to answer specific research questions. Members of the faculty should take part to pave the way for them, ensuring that they understand that life science research revolves around a multidisciplinary field.

AB  - In order to be well-educated citizens in the 21st century, children need to learn computing in school. However, implementing computing education in schools faces several practical problems, such as lack of computing teachers and time in an already overloaded curriculum. A solution can be a multidisciplinary approach, integrating computing education within other subjects in the curriculum. The present study proposes an instructional unit for computing education in social studies classes, with students learning basic computing concepts by programming history related games using Scratch. The instructional unit is developed following an instructional design approach and is applied and evaluated through a case study in four classes (5th and 7th grade) with a total of 105 students at a school in (omitted for submission). Results provide a first indication that the instructional unit enables the learning of basic computing concepts (specifically programming) in an efficient, effective and entertaining way increasing also the interest and motivation of students to learn computing.

AB  - Using an autoethnographic approach, this article draws on my personal experience as an Asian Pacific American (APA) political theorist who has navigated between different institutional spaces to reflect on a phenomenon that I call "elastic racialization" of APAs in higher education and its implications on our pedagogic agenda and curriculum. While the existing notion of "differential racialization" critically captures the ways in which racial minority groups have been racialized in different ways in accordance with the changing interests of the dominant group, the concept is often used in a broad U.S. national context such that even though it underlines fluidity in the social construction of race, the racialized meanings of particular racial groups can become fixed understandings and paradigms. As a result, we stop short of exploring further how the differential racialization of people of color--for instance, APAs as the "model minority" and the "perpetual foreigner"--can take on more protean forms in particular locations and contexts. Through a self-reflective analysis, I discuss how my racialized positionality in academia has taken on a more nuanced, elastic quality in different institutional contexts: shifting between "racial stranger" in the predominantly White space of political theory within political science and "racial underling" in the multiracial space of an interdisciplinary academic unit. Elastic racialization systemically effaces APA experiences/issues in the teaching/learning agenda of political science and other (inter)disciplinary fields, underlining the resilient multiformity of racism that requires a protean and multipronged approach of counter-racialization in higher education.

AB  - The problem of PhD attrition, especially at the dissertation-writing stage, is not solely related to mentoring, departments, or disciplines; it is a problem that affects the entire institution. As such, solutions require collaborative efforts for student success. Building on Yeatman's master--apprentice model, which assumes mastering disciplinary writing in singular advisor--student contexts, and Burnett's collaborative cohort model, which introduced doctoral dissertation supervision in a collaborative-learning environment with several faculty mentors in a single discipline, the Dissertation House model (DHM) introduces a model of doctoral dissertation supervision that involves multiple mentors across several disciplines. On the basis of more than 200 students' reflections, we find that challenges in completing the dissertation extend beyond departmental and disciplinary boundaries. The DHM's multidisciplinary approach preserves the traditional master--apprentice relationship between faculty and students within academic departments while providing an additional support mechanism through interdisciplinary collaborative cohorts. Using Thoits's coping assistance theory and data from DH students over a 10-year period, the DHM incorporates Hoadley's concept of knowledge communities to establish a successful dissertation-writing intervention for graduate students across doctoral programs. Using propensity score analysis, we provide in this study an empirical assessment of the benefits and efficacy of the DHM.

AB  - This study examines the effects of a design thinking intervention on first-year students' teamwork skills from a multi-actor perspective. A design thinking course was evaluated throughout a semester. Six-hundred-and-forty university students participated, guided by twenty-six facilitators. The students received in-class training and worked in multi-disciplinary teams to develop a solution for a real-life problem. In this quasi-experimental study, data were collected twice: in the middle (t1), and at the end (t2) of the course. Each time, students were rated by their teammates, themselves, and the course facilitator, using a rubric to map teamwork skills. The results show a significant improvement in teamwork skills, as consistently observed in the three ratings. The results also show a significant effect of sex on the improvement over time. Female students showed more considerable progress than male students. This study addresses researchers' demands regarding the lack of robust evidence to assess the impact of design thinking in higher education settings. Furthermore, building on the data from a large sample size and an intervention designed in a replicable way, this study contributes to the available empirical evidence that helps one to adopt and implement design thinking in universities to develop essential skills, such as teamwork.

AB  - Epistemological preferences in Western academies over the centuries became the measuring rod for what is to count as valid knowledge in thinking about development. The genealogy of the sciences of law and economics can be traced back to the Roman and British empires. The problem is posed in this paper as to the question of how remnants of these genealogies continue to influence development models and to what extent the academy may be in need of transformation by the inclusion of epistemologies and ethics found in modernity's "other", i.e. in cultures that continue to exist outside modernity. This transformation of the academy by enlargement, it is argued, would become more feasible by scientific methodologies inspired by forms of transdisciplinarity, trilateral science, and "praxis."

AB  - The notion of family resemblance has recently emerged as a promising and fruitful approach to characterising the nature of science (NOS) in science education research, offering solutions to some perplexing challenges such as capturing both the domain-general and domain-specific features of science with a single framework. At the same time, however, criticism has been levelled that the resemblance might eventually extend to certain activities that are not scientific but pose as science. This would be an undesirable consequence for science educators, particularly given the increasing need for individuals to discern pseudoscientific claims circulated on social media from scientific information. Many pseudoscientific and non-scientific activities resemble science in terms of their aim to explain nature, their use of evidence-based methods, and their interrelation with politics and society. In this theoretical article, we build on the concept of family resemblance to consider how it can simultaneously explain the diversity and unity of science and help students to learn about the nature of science and that of pseudoscience in science education. We put forward three principles that can guide teaching about pseudoscience based on the family resemblance conceptualisation of science.

AB  - Present and future social and ecological challenges are complex both to understand and to attempt to solve. To comprehend the complex systems underlying these issues, students need systems thinking skills. However, in science education, a uniform delineation of systems thinking across contexts has yet to be established. While there seems to be consensus on a number of key skills from a theoretical perspective, it remains uncertain whether it is possible to distinguish levels of systems thinking, and if so, how they would be determined. In this study, we investigated the impact of the specifics of a system on the skills and levels of systems thinking. We administered a 36-item multiple-choice test to 196 Grade 5 and 6 students. For our analysis, we followed a quantitative approach, applying a systems thinking model that incorporates the latest insights on the levels and skills of systems thinking in geography to the context of ecology. By following an Item Response Theory approach, we confirmed a set of systems thinking skills that are necessary to understand complex systems in ecology: identifying system organization, analyzing system behavior, and system modeling. We examined whether individual skill levels can be distinguished to determine whether a system's general principle or system-specific features cause difficulty for students. Our results indicate that system specifics, such as type of relation within ecosystems (e.g., predator-prey), appear to determine the formation of levels. Students struggled most with the difference between basic, direct cause-and-effect relationships and indirect effects. Once they understood the relevance of indirect relationships in moderately complex systems, a further increase in complexity caused little additional difficulty. Accordingly, we suggest that systems thinking should be examined from a variety of perspectives. To promote interdisciplinary learning, a systems thinking model that defines key commonalities across fields while leaving space for system specifics is needed.

AB  - This case study analyzes engagement during situated learning students engaged in the Global Game Jam, a three-day game development event. The themes identified as indicators of engagement for thematic analysis during this research were from the National Center for Educational Statistics' (NCES) National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE). The situated learning experiences provided to 30 college students, over three years, afforded them opportunities that otherwise had not existed in the curriculum. While the initiative was hosted in the Department of Computer Science, students from many disciplines were involved, The engagement with the local business incubator created opportunities for students to work with companies, sell their software, and connect with entrepreneurs as mentors. Finally, this case study exemplifies how faculty can leverage the power of activities to scaffold learning and engage learners in computer science, with the community, and with other disciplines through interdisciplinary teamwork. Of the nine indicators for engagement considered from the NSSE, reflections from students indicated that all students experienced at least five. This two-day event provided an opportunity for the university to build experiences of student engagement with students with minimal cost. The design of this problem-based simulation situated learning experience may build engagement for students outside of computer science and engineering disciplines.

AB  - Technology and Engineering (T&E) education has traditionally included safety as a core component of its curriculum and instruction. Recommendations for safety instruction can be found in manual arts and industrial arts documents (Christy, 1938). Safety was emphasized across all grade levels, including the elementary grades (Miller & Boyd, 1970). At the elementary level the purpose was to, "promote the use of tools and develop a desirable attitude toward safety in the school and home" (Sotzin, 1960). Safety was also emphasized in the Standards for Industrial Arts Education Programs (Dugger, Bame, Pinder, & Miller, 1981). This focus on safety provided the foundation for identifying safety as a core concept in the field. Many of the safety resources and research findings from these eras helped to inform the safety practices used today. Currently, a number of content areas have identified safety as a fundamental component, specifically technology education (Gunter, 2007; ITEA, 2003), engineering education (Huffman, Grubbs, Strimel, & Gurganus, 2018), career and technical education (CTE) (Toglia, 2009), science education (NSTA, 2016), and elementary education (ACS, 2011; Weaver, 2017). This widespread focus on safety may be the result of increased hazards resulting from interdisciplinary STEM initiatives such as makerspaces and the addition of engineering practices within "Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)."

AB  - We propose cross-disciplinary learning as a construct that can guide instruction and assessment in programs that feature sequential learning across multiple science disciplines. Crossdisciplinary learning combines insights from interdisciplinary learning, transfer, and resources frameworks and highlights the processes of resource activation, transformation, and integration to support sense-making in a novel disciplinary context by drawing on knowledge from other prerequisite disciplines. In this article, we describe two measurement approaches based on this construct: (a) a paired multiple choice instrument set to measure the extent of cross-disciplinary learning; and (b) a think-aloud interview approach to provide insights into which resources are activated, and how they are used, when making sense of an unfamiliar phenomenon. We offer implications for program and course assessment.

AB  - Science and drawing have been paired for hundreds of years, and this synergy is still prevalent in research investigating the role of drawing for developing and assessing understanding. However, despite research at the primary and secondary levels of education, there is limited research on whether drawing facilitates learning at the undergraduate level, particularly in human biology. This subject is specifically important to focus on as it can be a core subject on some multidisciplinary programmes that do not require a science background at entry. The literature reviewed in this paper highlights that drawing tasks are well received by students and that they perceive the tasks to be helpful for their understanding. There is also some evidence that it might improve learning. However, this cannot be concluded with confidence due to some limitations with respect to comparison groups, including such a group being absent, using retrospective cohorts as a control, and not controlling for instruction between groups. Furthermore, some of the reported improvements in tests are practically very small. More work is warranted in this area as there is a risk that misconceptions can be passed on to students and between students using this type of teaching activity.

AB  - Numerous studies have shown that teaching the history and philosophy of science (POS) can help improve senior high school students' scientific literacy. The history of science is usually taught in school science lessons by reference to particular cases, experiments, and scientists. In contrast, the POS -- that is, the study of general and fundamental questions regarding the nature of science (NOS) -- is often embedded within lessons, is considered difficult to teach, and is sometimes hidden from students. This research analyses the overlap between the conceptualisations of the NOS and the POS. The paper also reports on a study that used "explicit" pedagogical methods to teach topics related to the POS to Chinese senior high school students. The empirical results, which are supported by a theoretical framework that adopts the family resemblance approach to the NOS, show that students who participated in this POS course significantly improved their scientific literacy and their understanding of the relationships among science, technology, and society. The POS topics in this course helped students better understand the cognitive-epistemic system in the NOS. The findings of this small-scale study have broader implications for the way in which the POS is taught in high school education.

AB  - Purpose: This study developed an interdisciplinary STEM module called the 'Malaysian-Biotechnology-STEM' (MBS) based on the proposed conceptual framework. In addition, this study demonstrated an interdisciplinary approach to teach biotechnology. Method: A two-week pilot test was conducted in Perak, Malaysia. The student questionnaire and biotechnology achievement test were administered to 12 secondary school students (16-18 years old) from a selected school that offered Additional Science. The data were analysed with descriptive statistics. Findings: The study found that the MBS module could improve students understanding in biotechnology and help to foster their 21st century skills such as digital era literacy skill and inventive skill. The study also found that the average mean score of the student achievement improved after the intervention with MBS module. Significance: It can be concluded that the implementation of interdisciplinary MBS module could improve student understanding in biotechnology. Thus, it could further enhance students' interest to pursue the field in higher learning institutions and produce sufficient future workforce for the biotechnology industry.

AB  - This article focuses on an argument-based inquiry (ABI) approach to a fourth grade unit on waves. A fourth-grade teacher included multiple opportunities for students to read, write, and use language to represent their understanding of physical science Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) performance expectations (NGSS Lead States 2013). He used the ABI approach for the STEM Infused Science Teaching (ASSIST) approach, which will be discussed briefly in this article and can be used to engage students in work with any science concept. In a follow-up interview, the fourth grade teacher who taught this unit indicated that the students were engaged throughout the lesson. Also, he noticed that when he taught the math portions of the lesson, the students were more attentive than they typically would be. He also indicated that being a self-contained teacher was beneficial to this lesson because he could use his language arts time to teach the reading lesson about different types of waves, and math time to teach about graphs, angles, and area.

AB  - Organizational patterns can serve as a teaching strategy for instructors and as a learning tool for students to develop their expository writing skills, which are commonly required for assignments (for example, laboratory reports and research papers) in Food Science courses and in their future careers. The article discusses the importance of organizational patterns for teaching expository writing through an interdisciplinary collaboration. The teaching collaboration occurred with professors from Food Science, English, and Anthropology in an introductory Food Science course (FSCI 232) taught at California State University Long Beach (CSULB). In FSCI 232, students learned how to use organizational patterns to interpret and explain the content of an infographic obtained from the Food Technology magazine, published by the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT). The infographic "Global Obesity's Expanding Girth, the World is Getting Fatter" served as a visual stimulus to help students identify these patterns, focusing on inquiry and analysis of scientific data and skills required for technical writing. Furthermore, the article illustrates those other potential applications of organizational patterns using the infographic could extend to interdisciplinary content (that is, Food Anthropology), which facilitates the development of cultural competency and sensitivity in food systems. Additionally, the article provides sample activities for teachers to use in their classrooms. To summarize, organizational patterns can serve as an effective teaching strategy to enhance students' writing skills across Food Science and related disciplines.

AB  - The biomaterials science has advanced in a high speed with global science and technology development during the recent decades, which experts predict to be more obvious in the near future with a more significant position for medicine and health care. Although the three traditional subjects, such as medical science, materials science and biology that act as a scaffold to support the structure of biomaterials science, are still essential for the research and education of biomaterials, other subjects, such as mechanical engineering, mechanics, computer science, automatic science, nanotechnology, and Bio-MEMS, are playing more and more important roles in the modern biomaterials science development. Thus, the research and education of modern biomaterials science should require a logical integration of the interdisciplinary science and technology, which not only concerns medical science, materials science and biology, but also includes other subjects that have been stated above. This article focuses on multidisciplinary nature of biomaterials, the awareness of which is currently lacking in the education at undergraduate stage. In order to meet this educational challenge, we presented a multidisciplinary course that referred to not only traditional sciences, but also frontier sciences and lasted for a whole academic year for senior biomaterials undergraduate students with principles of a better understanding of the modern biomaterials science and meeting the requirements of the future development in this area. The course has been shown to gain the recognition of the participants by questionnaires and specific "before and after" comments and has also gained high recognition and persistent supports from our university. The idea of this course might be also fit for the education and construction of some other disciplines.

AB  - Global perspectives instruction often focuses on current news events, neglecting deeper human connections between local and global issues. This paper proposes "ecopedagogy" as a solution. Ecopedagogy is a critical approach that emphasizes the interconnectedness of people and the environment. By integrating ecopedagogy into interdisciplinary units, teachers can engage students in meaningful activities that develop critical thinking, cultural competence, and a sense of responsibility for the planet. Examples of ecopedagogical strategies include collaborative projects addressing local environmental challenges, journal prompts reflecting on personal connections to nature, and outdoor learning experiences. By fostering social-environmental awareness, ecopedagogy empowers students to become stewards of the earth and active agents of change who contribute to a more sustainable future. Exploring environmental issues through a global lens exposes students to diverse cultural perspectives and worldviews. This exposure fosters respect for environmental and social values, laying the foundation for meaningful cross-cultural dialogue and collaboration.

AB  - This discussion examines the ever-increasing impact of top-down nation-wide educational reforms on teachers in Japan, exemplified in the 2020 reform. Its unique contribution is a suggestion of an interdisciplinary framework: programming education and English as a foreign language education in elementary schools. Many elementary school teachers are not specialists in computer programming or English education as discipline specialties, yet they face the obligation to teach both subject areas under the authority of the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology. Their lack of training in these curricular areas creates a high level of anxiety as they initially perceived daunting new challenges in their work performances. Concerning programming education, many teachers are not even digital natives, working in schools where "IT rooms [are] covered with dust". The research highlighted here resulted from the authors' engagement in professional development workshops for teachers, "Integrated Programming English Education," demonstrating how much these two disciplines share commonalities and how teachers can effectively use them in their daily teaching. The study results reveal how interdisciplinary frameworks can disrupt deficit norms in teaching single-disciplinary subjects overly used in Japanese education, and simultaneously increase teacher agency through the connectivity of programming and English language education.

AB  - Research on science teaching and learning commonly makes use of reductionism to specify conditions of science learning. In my studies of academics'-of-science-teaching-&-learning (academics'"-of-st&l") research practices and values, I discuss how philosophic inquiry shifted my research practices from reductionism to critical (or, "new") materialism, where critical materialism is a research approach attuned to the materiality of social practices. Reading materiality as affectual, intellectual, and spatial components of practices turns my attention toward the logics informing academics'"-of-st&l" research practices as well as the comfortable and dangerous effects of particular practices on our connectible landscape. In this forum response, I briefly explore multiple logics informing academics'"-of-st&l" conference attendance choices, in addition to these choices' alignment to communal definition rendered by governmental and conference entities. I also explore other modes of communal boundary-marking experienced by academics"-of-st&l" that do not make use of formal definitions, but suggest that it is in the minutiae of conference relating that academics"-of-st&l" construct their sensing of communal un/boundedness. With these explorations, I hope to generate awareness of the small shifts that re-configuring practices can make possible in academics'"-of-st&l" connectivity.

AB  - While increased attention has been put on approaches to teaching science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), little has been reported on teachers' views, perceptions, and beliefs about teaching STEM. Such knowledge is needed to inform efforts to support innovative teaching of STEM subjects in classrooms. In this study, 154 in-service teachers of both STEM-related and non-STEM related subjects, were randomly selected from schools all over Thailand. Data on teachers' perceptions were captured through a three-part questionnaire including an open-ended question that asked for general background information and perceptions of STEM education and STEM integration. Descriptive statistics were used to analyzed data and content analysis was used to analyze open-ended responses. Research findings showed that the majority of teachers (85.5%) had never heard about STEM education and approximately 19% of in-service teachers could not provide a definition of STEM education, with 20.53% of the teachers viewing STEM as a transdisciplinary course or program. While teachers think that a STEM teaching approach is very interesting, both STEM and non-STEM in-service teachers have strong concerns about the engineering discipline within STEM disciplines.

AB  - The aim of this research is to determine the effectiveness of an enacted professional development (CPD) programme to promote teacher's self-efficacy with respect to implementing motivational, context-based science teaching, following an education through science (EtS), three-stage model approach. The CPD is designed, based on a constructivist, sociocultural professional development model (CSPM) to meet professional needs of each teacher within a predetermined teaching-learning approach and enacted through suitable instructional methods linked to teacher as learner, teacher as teacher and teacher as reflective practitioner. The effectiveness of the CPD is identified by means of a carefully constructed and validated Teacher Needs Questionnaire (TNQ), plus follow-up teacher interviews. Findings suggest the outcomes of the CPD, both from pre-post use of the TNQ and the undertaking of interventions, using teaching-learning modules based on the CPD, are effective in raising teacher's self-efficacy with respect to new interdisciplinary content knowledge, teaching approaches and classroom implementation, seen as being in line with curriculum expectations.

AB  - Interdisciplinary teaching has been advocated as a means to foster cooperation between traditionally separate fields and broaden students' perspectives in the classroom. We explored the pedagogical difficulties of interdisciplinary team teaching through a first-year seminar in magic, religion, and the origins of science. Although many accounts in the literature suggest a more cohesive approach to interdisciplinary teaching, we first introduced the separate fields, their methodologies, and limitations before combining the insights from all three fields to analyze case studies relating to the main themes of the course. In this case study, we reflect on how this "pieces-to-picture" method reduced student confusion when confronted with several disciplines in our classroom.

AB  - What role does advertising play in product development as part of owned media? For three years, a capstone advertising campaign course collaborated with STEM courses to form interdisciplinary teams composed of advertising, engineering, and computer science. The study provides insight into how teams can be more entrepreneurial by building on the strengths and techniques advertising students possess. Students, faculty, and external partners all saw the experiences as rewarding and valuable. Incorporating scrum project management gave more agency to advertising students while exposing them to product development processes commonly used by those who create technology. STEM students benefited from in-depth research to inform the products and see how advertising techniques can influence their development process. An overview of the approach, scrum project management, technology, assessment tools, lessons learned, and strategies to accomplish meaningful learning throughout the campaign collaborations with STEM students are provided.

AB  - This article addresses concerns about English competencies among Hispanic English as a second language (ESL) science students that perpetuate underrepresentation of Hispanic individuals in scientific discourse. Faculty and student perception surveys completed at the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey suggest that Hispanic ESL undergraduates require increased productive competencies in English. Those science majors with weak proficiency in English are significantly disadvantaged and current institutional practices don't address their needs. Recommendations include course development focused on productive competencies and interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - The maker movement advocates hands-on making with emerging technologies because of its value for promoting innovative and personally meaningful transdisciplinary learning. Educational research has focused on settings that primarily serve youth from dominant groups, yet we know surprisingly little about making among minoritized youth and the kinds of resources that support their making. This study sought to better understand the extent to which maker practices are present in the lives of minoritized youth and the network of resources that support their engagement. In this study, we analyzed survey responses of 52 youth from an urban, under-resourced community in Chicago and conducted an inductive thematic analysis of 20 interviews through a model of connected learning. Findings showed these youth participated in a diverse range of interest-driven, low-tech maker activities in their own homes more often than in school, after school programs, or through online resources and communities (i.e., YouTube, Internet, social media). Many youths displayed different levels of participation with intergenerational support, as parents and extended family members supported youth in their hands-on making. This work opens up pathways for fostering connected learning opportunities within minoritized communities by building on existing learning experiences within home settings and supportive relationships.

AB  - Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (NST) education is at the forefront of an emerging interdisciplinary frontier, ready to address global challenges. In this context, our research adopts a distinctive approach--using software applications in digital games to introduce young children to NST concepts and analyse resulting learning outcomes. The three-step research unfolds strategically, aiming to assess the effectiveness of two distinct digital technologies (computers and tablets) at an introductory level, influencing children's understanding of Nanotechnology concepts. One hundred fifty second-grade students, divided into experimental and control groups, participated in an exploration facilitated by the Test for the NANOtechnology Elementary Knowledge Assessment (TENANO). This tool meticulously measures the depth of children's knowledge about size, a fundamental aspect of NST. The experimental groups, especially the tablet group, significantly outperformed their post-test control counterparts. This marks a pioneering stride in early primary education. By leveraging children's familiarity with digital technology, this research harnesses the recent health crisis to advance NST education through interactive games, leaving a distinctive mark on early-primary NST education and paving the way for transformative educational methodologies.

AB  - The sustained recruitment and retention of students in STEM majors is a national concern. Although the rate of attrition in these majors is comparable to other majors, the demand for trained scientists to enter the workforce with a baccalaureate degree is high. To enhance retention and support of STEM students from their first year until graduation, we established a Residential Learning Community (RLC) for STEM majors at York College of Pennsylvania. Although similar learning communities already existed, this was the first of its kind at this institution. The primary components included living on campus with a roommate also in the program, taking courses like general chemistry and First-Year Seminar as a designated cohort, and receiving increased faculty mentoring through advising. The RLC, named STEM Scholars, was developed with significant institutional buy-in and interdisciplinary faculty support but without financial backing. Several key takeaways are reported in this article, notably the need for funding to support a STEM cohort program. The effectiveness of the program and its components continues to be assessed; results of the assessment will be shared in the future. Successful components of STEM Scholars can be incorporated at other institutions to enhance STEM education.

AB  - New science facilities have become a reality on many college campuses in the last few decades. Large time investments in creating shared programmatic vision and designing flexible spaces, partnered with large fiscal investments, have created a new generation of science building. Unfortunately, few studies provide evidence about whether the articulated goals were achieved. In this study, we revisit assessment of our science facilities after 5 years of occupancy, looking specifically for sustained gains in (a) student perceptions of interdisciplinarity, (b) the ability to stay focused despite high levels of visual connectedness, and (c) overall appreciation for the learning environment.

AB  - Today, the essential skills and characteristics of individuals change within the frame of changing needs. The acquisition of these skills to individuals is not sufficient with traditional education and difficulties are experienced in adapting to the age. While gaining 21st century skills, conducting interdisciplinary studies is becoming importance and increasing the efficiency. In this study, the effect of LEGO WeDo 2.0 robotics education on academic achievement, attitude and computational thinking skills of the learners toward science was examined. The study was conducted with 5th grade students (N=36) in a private school in Elazig in the 2017-2018 school year. The study model was the "pretest-posttest control group design" of the experimental method. As data collection tool, "Science Course Academic Achievement Test", "Science Course Attitude Scale", and "Computational Thinking Scale" were used in the study. While the activities in the experimental group were carried out with LEGO WeDo 2.0 Robotic Education Set, the same activities in the control group were implemented using the traditional direct instruction technique as in the curriculum. The application was continued for eleven weeks and the obtained quantitative data were evaluated at the significance level of 0.05 with SPSS packaged software. It was seen as a result of the study that attitudes, academic achievements and computational thinking skills of the experimental group students, who received robotic-assisted science education, toward science course differed significantly compared to the students in the control group.

AB  - The study was conducted as a case study to enhance pre-service science teachers' readiness for integration, inquiry-based learning (IBL), the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), and the application of real-life examples during their teacher training courses. The objective of the research was to explore pre-service science teachers' perceptions of integrated teaching, inquiry learning, and the use of ICT in science education, drawing on their experiences in teacher training. It also aimed to examine potential differences in their viewpoints and the evolution of their perceptions over time. A questionnaire was developed to gather insights from 50 pre-service science teachers regarding their views on the integration of science subjects before and after their 2-year teacher training courses. The collected data were analyzed using a qualitative approach with the QCAmap software, followed by a quantitative analysis utilizing the Microsoft Excel software. The findings revealed significant variances in perceptions among pre-service teachers based on the number of science subjects they studied during their training. Those who studied two or more subjects placed greater emphasis on the value of integration, IBL, ICT use, and real-life examples in science education, and exhibited more significant changes in their views throughout the 2 years of teacher training. Furthermore, the study found that nearly half of the pre-service teachers did not view IBL in science classes as crucial, and only about a quarter recognized the importance of ICT utilization.

AB  - This research compares the industry readiness, product development skill level, and overall knowledge gains of students taking an undergraduate research course (treatment) to those who did not (control). This 2-semester Applied Interdisciplinary Product Development (AIPD) course for sophomores brought together interdisciplinary teams of food science, nutrition, and packaging science students in a hands-on setting to create healthy food products for children, complete with retail packaging. A Subject Knowledge Assessment (SKA) was used to evaluate the mean percent difference value (MPDV) of food science, nutrition, packaging science, and general product development knowledge gained through the course. SKA results indicated that the MPDV were significantly different (a = 0.05) between the treatment and comparison groups in the overall score and in every subject area score except packaging science. Data from an Exit Questionnaire (EQ) was used for evaluation of attitudes pertaining to product development knowledge and skills, department engagement, and pedagogy. EQ results indicated that mean scores between the treatment and comparison groups were significantly different (a = 0.05) in 7 of the 9 statements on product development knowledge and skills, both statements pertaining to pedagogy, and the statement pertaining to department engagement. Overall, the research project was considered a successful intervention for educating sophomores at the University. Overall, the research project was considered a successful intervention for educating sophomores in the Food, Nutrition and Packaging Science department at Clemson University. The student-lead teams were held to a greater degree of accountability for their success in terms of education gleaned and value of experience gained as metric for the University and other IFT Accredited programs.

AB  - In our technology driven world today, it is extremely important to increase the science literacy of our non-science majors. At Stockton University, this goal is attempted to be accomplished through our General Studies courses. This paper describes a lab-based course in the General Studies curriculum, 'The Science of Ice Cream'. At Stockton University, General Studies courses are interdisciplinary courses, designed for all students in four areas of study: general arts and humanities (GAH), general interdisciplinary skills and topics (GEN), general integration and synthesis (GIS), general natural sciences and mathematics (GNM), and general social and behavioral sciences (GSS). The GNM courses are designed to meet four main goals: to examine the broad concerns of science, to explore the nature of scientific process and practice, to provide students with an understanding of mathematics and the natural sciences, to acquire appreciation for how scientific knowledge of the physical and natural world is attained and evaluated. The topic of ice cream was chosen because it provides a rich environment, full of practical applications of thermodynamics and fluid dynamics, as well as general concepts in physics, biology, food science, and chemistry. Since this course is designed for both science and non-science majors, it provides a platform to discuss applications of concepts learned in introductory physics. It is sometimes difficult to get non-science majors excited about science, but the laboratory exercises, where the students use the concepts learned in lecture to make ice cream, provide the students with interesting and approachable examples of the physical concepts.

AB  - While interdisciplinary collaboration is desired among researchers, traditional science instruction generally results in science disciplines being taught as separate entities. This study focuses on student understanding of concepts at the intersection of two isolated disciplines--geoscience and bioscience--across two purposeful samples of college-aged students (United States, Germany). Specifically, we explored: (1) how students conceptualize large-scale biologic and geologic changes on Earth over deep time; (2) the relationship between student's conceptions and their understanding of evolutionary and geologic theories; and (3) how those conceptualizations explicate the need for integration of concepts within school curricula. Students were asked to respond to items about seven major evolutionary events in Earth's history (biosciences) and perceived changes to Earth's size and continental positions over time (geosciences). Both groups exhibited difficulties understanding absolute ages in deep time, although Young Earth and Young Life perspectives were present in the U.S. group and absent in the German group. Conceptions about changes to Earth's size and continental positions over time were consistent across both groups. Findings highlight the need for scientific education instruction in both countries that is interdisciplinary in content.

AB  - We define and describe the academic studio model for interdisciplinary, undergraduate, project-oriented education. This model brings faculty, students, and community partners together to investigate an openended academic question, and their collaboration yields an original product that represents their inquiry. The academic studio integrates agile software development practice, project-oriented pedagogy, and sociocultural cognition theories. Scrum provides the framework in which self-organizing, cross-functional teams define their methodology, and Scrum practices facilitate assessment of student learning outcomes. This model emerged from design-based research across six studio instances, each of which investigated the relationship of fun, games, and learning through the development of educational video games. Formal and informal analysis of these instances gives rise to several themes, including the importance of a formalized process to encourage learning and productivity, the critical role of an expert faculty mentor, the need to combine academic and industrial practice to manage the inherent challenges of collaborative software development, and the unique characteristics of learning outcomes arising from this model. We conclude that the academic studio model is beneficial to student learning and faculty development, and we encourage the adoption, adaptation, and evaluation of the model.

AB  - The diversifying impacts of global disasters such as climate change and COVID-19 call for systematic consideration of how disasters can be addressed in different school subjects. In this paper, we discuss how the relationship between disaster and science education has been codified and framed in South Korea through an analysis of national curriculum and policy documents from the 2010s, a period marked by several human-caused disasters with lingering social impacts. A genealogical reading of policy documents reveals how disaster emerged as a curricular theme at the intersection of two policy discourses: the discourse of safety and the discourse of integration. Further analysis of the documents points to three tensions about science education that underlay this process, as disaster, a non-traditional topic, was introduced into the science curriculum. Our findings provide insights into the tensions and conflicting ideas about what should be learned in school science. We contend that a stronger theoretical and empirical base is needed when introducing new curriculum topics such as disaster into the curriculum. More effort is needed to justify the new topic against the existing aims and structures of school subjects, to consider the unique social and political context, and to bridge the gap between curriculum policy and classroom practice.

AB  - Many institutions are preparing graduate students and postdoctorals (future faculty) for effective teaching in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Interestingly, little is known about beneficial features of teaching-development (TD) programs for future faculty after they transition into professoriate roles, and how these features are useful. We investigated the features of a TD program for STEM future faculty that were influential to their current teaching as faculty members, and in transitioning into faculty positions. Data were collected using in-depth interviews with 10 alumni (current faculty) from different STEM disciplines one to five years after participating in the TD program. Three themes emerged from this study: (1) exposure to multiple effective teaching approaches and pedagogy literature; (2) opportunities for experiential learning, active learning, a multi-disciplinary learning community, and diversity and inclusion; and (3) the impact of the TD program on participants' career choices. Findings imply the need to develop TD programs that expose participants to multiple evidence-based pedagogies, and that weave in opportunities for experiential learning, interactive-workshop activities, and a learning community.

AB  - This article proposes an indirect method to evaluate the corrosion rate of iron nail in simulated seawater. The official procedure is based on the direct measurement of the specimen's weight loss over time; however, a highly precise scale is required and such equipment may not be easily available. On the other hand, mobile phones equipped with good built-in cameras have become an essential part of everyday lives of students and educators. With the built-in cameras, students followed the formation of the colored complex from the reaction between released iron ions and 1,10-phenanthroline. The images were then decomposed into the RGB channels that were converted into absorbance. Another point worth mentioning is that rather than providing students with a step-by-step procedure, the instructor used a problem-based approach that enabled students to develop the experimental procedure themselves. This project-driven interdisciplinary experiment engaged students into thinking and producing the experiment. Finally, bringing cell phones into science teaching was very helpful as it made learning more inviting and meaningful.

AB  - This paper proposes a study of the various ways in which social and ethical issues are integrated in the curricula of nanoscience and nanotechnology master degrees. During the last decade, new types of courses have appeared in science and technology universities, first in the United States and now reaching Europe and France, associating a call for interdisciplinarity with a strong convergence of science and industry and new ways of integrating social and/or human sciences in scientific curricula. These courses entitled "science and society", meant for science students, lean on (and participate in the construction of) specific ways of describing science, technology, and the social world, generally saturated with political values. The integration of these courses in science education, linked with a strong effort to specify new institutional organizations of scientific practice and education (in particular through political support of emerging fields like nanoscience, synthetic biology, or the cognitive sciences), may play an important role in the acculturation of future scientists and engineers to "good" scientific practices and discourses. The case of nanoscience and nanotechnology is particularly revealing of the changes which are now taking place in some universities. This paper will strive to identify different types of courses called "nano and society", taking examples from both French and American contexts, and linking them to more or less implicit socio-epistemic and political values.

AB  - This scientometric analysis explores the evolution and dynamics of Early Childhood STEAM education. Web of Science database is employed as a primary data source and visualization tools like CiteSpace and HistCite are used to systematically investigate 179 publications published between 2008 and 2023. It looks at research patterns to unearth notable shifts in focus and intensity influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Keyword analysis reveals the field's evolution, from foundational elements to broader dimensions encompassing technology, pedagogy, and gender disparities. A transition towards experiential learning, emotional identity, and professional development is evident, which reflects a pedagogical shift towards comprehensive and inclusive education. Temporal analysis using Citation Burst Analysis delineates phases of research, emphasizing shifts from fundamental exploration to pedagogical methods and experiences. Acknowledgement of influential scholars, collaborations, and global trends underscores events of interdisciplinary partnerships and international collaborations. The study's implications highlight pedagogical transformations, gender disparity, and the potential for technology in early childhood education. This could inform policy directions and foster collaborations for innovative education.

AB  - Pigments are light-absorbing substances that are abundant in nature, serving roles in coloration, camouflage, mate/pollinator attraction and photosynthesis among higher life forms. Among microbial organisms, pigments can also be found in a wide range of phyla. While some of these pigments function in photosynthesis, namely among algae and some bacteria, the great majority of microbial pigments play entirely different roles. The exploratory study presented here will stimulate students to think about the cost and benefit of a heritable trait (pigment production) of microscopic organisms and its effects on survival in a competitive and hostile environment. Exploring and understanding the roles these pigments play allows for a number of cross-disciplinary learning opportunities that combine physics, chemistry, biology and even art, and can be set up as an inquiry-based learning module suitable for small-group and active learning experiences.

AB  - This article outlines the theoretical rationale and process for an integrated-science approach to teaching sensation and perception (S&P) to undergraduate psychology students that may also serve as an integrated-science curriculum. The course aimed to introduce the interdisciplinary evolution of this psychological field irrespective of any presumed distinctions between hard and soft science. The class began with perceptual science's foundations in Fourier decomposition and culminated in more recent developments with the perceptual science's interest in pattern-formation phenomena from fluid dynamics, and class illustrated this transition with various applications in music, art, and materials science. Post-course responses to the Research on Integrated Science Curriculum survey demonstrated that our students made significantly large gains in course elements, specifically making the most of the students pre-existing experiences. We find that students are ready and willing to engage in the study of S&P by setting aside neuroscience's sometimes constraining assumptions.

AB  - This article presents the combination of three enhanced educational approaches for training future scientists. These methods incorporate skills generally not introduced in the freshman year: student-led blackboard introductions; the writing of scientific papers; and the design, execution, and presentation of an independent lab module. We tested these methods in an interdisciplinary science laboratory course at Princeton University and summarize 2 years of qualitative and quantitative data on the basis of students' evaluations of our approach. In addition to details on our implementation, we show that students mastered all of the requirements and embraced our expectations for greater creativity, independent thinking, and problem solving. The integration of these teaching methods early in their education can help them develop into more successful scientists, and the methods can be broadly applied across the natural sciences. Resources for implementation of our methods are provided.

AB  - The new field of Mind, Brain, and Education (MBE)--sometimes called educational neuroscience--is posited as a mediator between neuroscience and education. Several foundational concerns, however, can be raised about this emerging field. The differences between neuroscience and education are many, including differences in their histories, philosophies, and epistemologies. Historically, science and education have demonstrated separate, but interwoven, influences on society; philosophically, the values by which they operate are often in opposition; and epistemologically, the fields have relied on different conceptualizations of knowledge. Discussion about these differences has been largely absent in attempts to promote MBE. Two steps are proposed to respond to this omission. First, encouraging discussion about disciplinary differences and assumptions may enable better understanding between disciplines and facilitate the establishment of a more collaborative research community. Second, a "transdisciplinary" framework that focuses on salient issues of interest across disciplines should be considered. Transdisciplinarity aims for the creation of an inclusive research environment that transcends traditional disciplinary approaches to complex problems. This article initiates an exploration of disciplinary differences and proposes commitment to transdisciplinarity as a guiding principle that may increase the viability of MBE as a mediating field between neuroscience and education.

AB  - An interactive, field-based course on the environmental aspects of natural water was developed as part of STEM initiatives at a comprehensive university in the United States. The project is funded by the National Science Foundation. The course is focused on two fundamental student skills, such as hydrologic field procedures and analytical methods. For field procedures, an area watershed was delineated as a natural laboratory and integrated into the course curriculum by designing creek-side learning activities. For analytical methods, instrumental setup and analysis for water and soil samples were designed to cover core concepts in hydrology. The primary goal of the course is to portray water's important role in the natural environment. Exercises are written in an interdisciplinary setting making sure that students can identify real-life environmental problems and offer realistic solutions to them. By taking part in this project, students gained new knowledge on stream gauging, groundwater simulations, ion chemistry, GIS applications, bio-pollutants, wastewater treatment, hydrologic systems, and sampling protocol. Students also gained important skills in handling state-of-the-art equipment, including ion chromatograph, spectrophotometer, sediment analyzer, data-logger, and well purging systems. Outcomes assessment indicates that students who took the new course are more efficient in data collection, compilation, and interpretation associated with the availability, movement, and impairment of natural water. They are able to think more critically about the aquatic environment and the interrelationships among its components. Overall, the students view this course as one that has improved their learning in water sciences. Hands-on activities were very useful to critically think about natural processes that impact the water environment. They better understood how field and laboratory research data are used to implement water policies.

AB  - Four case studies of preservice teachers enrolled in a STEM-focused elementary teacher preparation program are used to document changes in mathematics and science teaching efficacy over the course of one academic year. Qualitative analysis revealed that all four case studies experienced changes in their mathematics and science teaching efficacy beliefs over the course of the year. Participants described unique ways of understanding their growth (or lack thereof) in teaching efficacy, the trajectory of teaching efficacy over the course of the year, and the role of teacher training in changing their efficacy beliefs.

AB  - The study of learning environments involves describing educational contexts and identifying empirical relationships among subject matter (curriculum), teaching practices and other environmental variables. In recent years, this has become a growing field of academic inquiry within elementary, secondary and post-secondary research. Investigations of this relationship between the environment and learning encompasses science education, environmental psychology, campus ecology and architecture, as well as inter- or multi-disciplinary fields of study such as environmental or place-based forms of education. Learning environment studies attempt to acknowledge and account for factors in both the physical and social realm, as well as describing how these socio-environmental conditions can influence the process and experience of learning. Our project at the Chilliwack Secondary School (CSS) aimed to further the study and investigation of student perceptions of both informal and formal learning environments within a high-school context. This study describes, refines and validates a new instrument for the measurement of perceptions of the physical environment at school. It also describes other qualitative methods that corroborate the selection of physical factors included in the survey. Together, these data provide rich descriptions of the factors in the learning environment at the CSS and describe the interaction of these factors in supporting learning.

AB  - There are a number of examples in technology education history of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary efforts linking technology education with other disciplines; however, there has never been a time in technology education where multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary efforts are not only promising but also may be essential for the prosperity of technology education. One important example of blurred boundaries caused by a multidisciplinary effort from the recent past was the Math, Science, and Technology (MST) movement in the early 1990s. The MST movement had an important impact on technology education, and a strong case can be made that the MST efforts of the 1990s paved the way for the recent STEM education initiatives. In this article, the author seeks to make the case that no previous multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary efforts within technology education's history has such potential to impact the field greater than the recent Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) movement. Here, the author defines the terms "multidisciplinary" and "interdisciplinary," reviews a recent history of such efforts in technology education, explores how funding can and has blurred the mission of technology education, and presents the opportunities for technology education regarding STEM education.

AB  - Background/purpose: In terms of computational thinking core facets, algorithmic thinking is a key competency applicable not only in Computer Science but also in aspects of daily life. Considering the global phenomenon of gender stereotypes with regards to the academic and professional orientation in STEM fields, we focused on investigating the level of students' algorithmic thinking skills by gender in early childhood. This article provides evidence of research implemented under the umbrella of quantitative methodology, employing an innovative assessment tool constructed to meet the requirements of the study. The findings obtained could facilitate researchers and policymakers to support equity in learning opportunities, starting from the first stage of compulsory education. Materials/methods: The study aligns to the principles of quantitative research methodology. Its backbone is a digital platform of multidisciplinary, play-based, and constructivist character, which we implemented from scratch in order to satisfy the requirements of our research. Results: The findings of the study revealed that algorithmic thinking skills are not related to students' gender in early childhood. Conclusion: The findings of the study bring out that, at very young ages, the effect of gender stereotypes is not observable as far as students' algorithmic thinking skills are concerned. The implications of the study highlight the need to focus on the schooling stages that follow early childhood in order to tackle the gender gap in STEM fields.

AB  - This column presents ideas and techniques to enhance science teaching. In this month's issue an upper elementary Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) challenge brings an engineer into the classroom while emphasizing cooperation, communication, and creativity. STEM activities come in various shapes and sizes. Some are quite involved and require students to possess some degree of prior knowledge and skills, while others are relatively simple and can be accomplished with minimal prior knowledge and skills. In this article, the authors provide an inexpensive, multi-day STEM task that brings a local engineer into the classroom. This spaghetti structure challenge is multidisciplinary, integrating STEM disciplines with reading and writing literacy. The spaghetti structure challenge engages students in problem-solving strategies and structural design processes in science and engineering. Problem solving enables students to assume ownership and responsibility of the task. Problem solving is a form of both active learning and discovery learning--a combination of hands-on and minds-on education. In this example, the authors chose to describe the task to students as a challenge rather than a competition to emphasize the 3 "Cs"-- cooperation, communication, and creativity. However, the decision to introduce the task as a challenge or a competition rests with the classroom teacher and whether his or her students are motivated by in-classroom peer competitions.

AB  - The integration of mathematics and science in teaching facilitates student learning, engagement, motivation, problem-solving, critical thinking, and real-life application. Although curriculum integration is theoretically desirable for many educators, what to integrate and how to integrate are often the big questions facing teachers working within education systems premised on a culture of segregated subject delivery. This quasi-experimental study reports on a 2-week inquiry of the implementation of an integrated unit of learning on motion problems, within upper secondary education in Turkey. In order to reveal the effect of the instruction on students with different mathematics achievements, the study was conducted with 131 students in two different schools. In the design of the integrated unit, continuum model of learning and four-stages of learning model were employed. The study employed a quantitative approach and examined the key aspects of the practice of the integration of mathematics and science teaching. In light of the data obtained, it was concluded that teaching the subject Motion Problems through an integrated design had a positive effect on students' learning for the experimental groups in each school.

AB  - This article presents a semester-long, interdisciplinary project-based learning (PBL) suitable for secondary and postsecondary students enrolled in a second-semester (i.e., intermediate) meteorology course. This case-study approach builds on the research question "What atmospheric conditions lead to tornadoes, hail, and damaging winds locally?" Students work collaboratively in a series of five activities, using an online database analyzing map and weather data from a subset of severe weather events. Students synthesize the data by identifying the severe qualitative weather variables that appeared most frequently among the cases and modify, if necessary, accepted threshold values for the quantitative variables. Students finalize the project via an oral presentation and technical paper to transform their newly discovered knowledge into improved severe weather forecasting guidance for societal benefit. An analysis of pre- and postsurvey responses from a small student sample reveals increases in both the comfort and experience of the PBL's components, with the oral presentation showing the most significant impact. After the project, students could identify in greater depth those antecedent atmospheric conditions that generate tornadoes, hail, and strong winds.

AB  - The current initiatives at European level urge more emphasis on the implementation of inquiry-based science education (IBSE). Although there are existing studies on the effect of IBSE on understanding science, fewer attempts have been made regarding the development of various inquiry skills. In this research, a model of consistent implementation of inquiry activities across the three subjects of mathematics, physics and informatics was developed and its efficacy with regard to selected inquiry skills development was examined. In order to evaluate the efficacy, a test assessing the level of inquiry skills development was designed. This test was taken by 300 high school students both before and after experimental teaching. In between students were exposed to coherent and intentional multidisciplinary inquiry-based learning within a period of approx. four months. The results showed a statistically significant increase on test scores that is gender independent, however the class specialization played a significant role. The results indicate that the designed model of coactive IBSE implementation is efficacious for inquiry skills development and therefore applicable in school practice.

AB  - Purpose: The present paper aims to examine the concept of "plant blindness" in the context of current sustainability debates. "Plant blindness" was the term introduced in 1999 by the botanists and educators James H Wandersee and Elisabeth E Schussler to describe what they saw as a pervasive insensitivity to the green environment and a general neglect of plants on the part of biology education. Design/methodology/approach: The fundamental importance of plants for life on Earth and the socio-educational challenges of redacted awareness of this importance are considered. Also, the diverse physiological, psychological, philosophical, cultural and geopolitical origins and consequences of indifference to plants in relation to aspects of sustainability agendas are examined with special reference to education. Findings: An examination of the outcomes of a range of research and practical initiatives reveals how multidisciplinary approaches to education and public engagement have the potential to address the challenge of "plant blindness". The need for these opportunities to be reflected in curriculums is not widely appreciated, and the socio-economic forces of resistance to confronting plant neglect continue to be formidable. Originality/value: Plant blindness is a relatively new field of research, and the full breadth of its implications are only gradually becoming apparent. If the present paper contributes to positioning plants as an essential element in sustainability education and practice, it will have met its objective.

AB  - Background: Despite the increasing square footage of green buildings worldwide, green building expertise remains largely in the domain of building industry professionals. However, the performance of and advocacy for green buildings would benefit from a green building literate general public. Green building education is an expanding frontier for STEM education and can create opportunities to integrate science and environmental literacies into the study of everyday environments. Few resources exist, however, to help STEM educators incorporate green building themes into the science classroom. The work here developed educational tools for connecting green buildings and science education through a multi-step process. An interdisciplinary literature review yielded a series of frameworks that were improved through two focus groups with science and environmental educators and built environment professionals. Results: The result of this process is a toolbox of conceptual frameworks for educators interested in using a systems-based approach to teach about green buildings as sites for complex interactions between human activity and Earth systems. The work here first leverages the broad definition of environmental literacy (knowledge, skills, affect, and behavior) to advance a working definition for "green building literacy." Next, major domains of green building knowledge are developed and linked to the Next Generation Science Standards. Conclusions: Green building literacy has been an ill-defined term and green building themes have not been rigorously connected to science and environmental education. The work here provides a foundation for promoting green building literacy through K-12 STEM education. The educational tools developed through this process can be used as a starting point for lesson planning to catalyze green building education in a variety of formal and informal settings.

AB  - An interdisciplinary approach provides many benefits that warrant the need for its use at technical universities teaching foreign language as an academic discipline. This article reviews recent Russian researches focused on interdisciplinary integration, summarizes advantages and proves overall high efficacy of the interdisciplinary approach to teaching a foreign language for students. When taken as a basis, this approach was found to open up new prospects for implementation of didactic principles of learning at foreign language classes. The article describes the implementation of the principles of interdisciplinary coordination, systematicity and consistency, scientificity, occupational focus, visualization, affordability, strength, consciousness, pro-active behavior, educational training, availability, focus on student's individual character, and intercultural interaction within the framework of the interdisciplinary approach. Incorporation of these principles is demonstrated using training of students of the National Research Nuclear University MEPhI [Moscow Engineering Physics Institute] as an example. At MEPhI, students learn a foreign language during the entire period of their education and study the following credit modules: Introduction into General Technical Foreign Language; General Technical Foreign Language; Occupation-oriented Foreign Language; Foreign Language for Occupation-oriented Communication, Business Communication; Foreign Language for Academic Research; and Communication Foreign Language (in-depth study).

AB  - The National Security Agency (NSA) awards Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) designations to institutions that commit to producing cybersecurity professionals who will work in careers that reduce vulnerabilities in our national infrastructure. A review of the curricula in the 327 institutions and their degree programs reveal that only two programs offer a required course about terrorism. Given the fluid nature of terrorism and its threat to national infrastructure, the omission is concerning. It is recommended that NSA-certified cybersecurity programs begin implementing educational content that aim to teach about this emerging crime and justice issue. One suggestion is to embrace the interdisciplinary nature of cybersecurity, as exemplified in the success of the Cybersecurity Living and Learning Community (CLLC). Designing courses that educate about the social processes that leads to the growing problem of violence and terror directed towards marginalized communities and our nation's technological infrastructure, is another.

AB  - This paper examines the implementation practices of a 6th grade middle school teacher enacting STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and math) teaching in his classroom after participating in a 45-hour STEAM professional development. Case study is used to detail the process, successes, and challenges. Project-based learning, technology integration, and transdisciplinary teaching are the lens from which the teacher's lesson and reflections are deconstructed. Challenges in STEAM teaching are discussed including the shifting role of the teacher, determining student collaboration, and time. This is part of a larger study examining the STEAM teaching practices of 43 middle school science and math teachers.

AB  - In the United States, school curricula are often created and taught with distinct boundaries between disciplines. This division between curricular areas may serve as a hindrance to students' long-term learning and their ability to generalize. In contrast, cross-curricular pedagogy provides a way for students to think beyond the classroom walls and make important connections across disciplines. The purpose of this paper is a theoretical reflection on our use of Expansive Framing in our design of lessons across learning environments within the school. We provide a narrative account of our early work in using this theoretical framework to co-plan and enact interdisciplinary mathematics and computer science (CS) tasks with a team of elementary school educators and school district personnel. The unit focuses on the concepts of exponents in mathematics and repeat loops as a control structure in computer science. Using a narrative approach, we describe what occurred during the collaborative planning of lessons and subsequent enactments in two fifth-grade classrooms and one computer lab and provide a practitioner-oriented account of our experience.

AB  - Despite widespread acknowledgment of the importance of interdisciplinary pedagogy, disciplinary teaching remains the norm on most campuses, primarily due to cost and institutional constraints. Bridging the gap between literature on interdisciplinary teaching and active-learning techniques, this article describes an innovative and less costly approach through the linkage of case-study active-learning techniques with interdisciplinary principles at a small liberal arts college. We apply this student-centered approach to teaching international development, a field that critically needs integration across several social sciences. A practical way for political scientists to encourage undergraduate-level interdisciplinary thinking is to develop a case study that asks students to utilize practical problem-solving skills and policy analysis. We analyze the implementation and assessment of such a case study, discuss its successes and shortcomings and provide suggestions for expanded implementation. We also discuss the broad applicability of this approach to topics that require integration across disciplines in a variety of institutional settings.

AB  - A Wiki research project was created in the Functional Foods for Health (FST/HNFE 2544) as an instructional tool and assignment for improving undergraduate students' proficiency in evaluating appropriate information sources for rapidly evolving science and research. The project design targeted improving students' information literacy skills including how students obtain, discern relevant and reliable scientific information from propaganda, critique information, and communicate scientific language. In addition to the Wiki research project, guest experts in political science, statistics, and human nutrition discussed their expertise as related to functional foods to the class. A reviewer rubric was developed to evaluate and compare Wiki project assignments from the Fall 2013 course (experimental; cross-disciplinary topics) with the previous course offering (control, Fall 2012; no cross-disciplinary lectures) to establish a directionality of academic performance change between the 2 course years. Eight rubric criteria were categorized as critical thinking, cross-discipline, and communication (scoring: 1 [lowest] and 3 [highest]). We observed that the critical thinking criteria (n = 5) had improved scores (P < 0.05) from Fall 2012 to Fall 2013. Cross-discipline criteria (n = 2) had one categorical improvement (P < 0.05) but one category did not have improved scores (P > 0.05) in the experimental year (Fall 2013) despite the multidiscipline guest lectures. This educational intervention provides value to instructors for incorporating critical thinking, information literacy, and communication assignments that encourage skill development and practice to improve student proficiency. Students felt their skills and knowledge increased based on this project. This manuscript provides assignment guidelines and teaching techniques used to assist in development and improvement of students' critical thinking skills, communication, and information literacy.

AB  - This study was conducted to determine if embedding effective study strategies in a course would result in an increased use of these strategies and, therefore, increase success and retention in introductory-level science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) courses. An interdisciplinary team of STEM faculty members created study strategies video modules that were embedded in their courses. A concurrent course in the same subject was taught without the modules, with this course serving as a control. Data were collected regarding course content knowledge, study strategies awareness, study strategies use, student confidence, course completion, course success, and course retention. Over the course of 3 semesters, faculty team members collected data via pre- and posttests and surveys. Completion, success, and retention data were obtained from college records. A significant change (p < 0.0001) in the use of flashcards, interleaving, spaced practice, and the Pomodoro Technique was seen in students exposed to the study strategies modules. A significant change (p < 0.01) was also seen in time management in the experimental group. Although results indicate that exposure to study strategies makes students aware of their skill deficits, efficacy data indicate that other factors keep them from fully adopting new study techniques.

AB  - This experiment of innovative university education shows the interdisciplinary work carried out in the studies of the Bachelor of Science in Education at the University of Andorra. The study was developed within two subjects: Communication Technology (TAC) and Cultural Heritage Education in Andorra. The main objective of this experiment is to foster the use of technological resources and digital materials, with the aim of drawing cultural heritage closer to the classroom. Based on a previous study of documentation and an analysis of online educational materials, the students have to design an e-book, which is understood to be digital material in the curricular field of cultural heritage. This digital material is a didactic proposal that focuses on the construction of knowledge by primary school students. During the elaboration of the materials the instructors introduce follow-up activities. The results of the experiment show that, from an interdisciplinary approach, and a problem-solving, learning-centered methodology, specific and transferable abilities in initial teacher training can be studied and evaluated.

AB  - Anorexia nervosa is a complex behavioral disorder with the highest risk of death of any psychological disorder. Between 15% and 20% of those suffering from anorexia die from complications that are attributed either directly or indirectly to self-starvation. Heritability for anorexia is around 0.5, meaning about 50% of the risk for anorexia is attributable to genetics and the other 50% is attributable to environmental factors. Sufferers may be as young as 5 years old and as old as 80. Some with anorexia recover completely and some struggle with it for a lifetime. Average recovery time is between 3 and 7 years. This directed case study uses a progressive disclosure model to expose students to the multiple facets of anorexia. The case follows Megi, a teenage girl who has recovered from anorexia. The case has been taught in advanced general psychology and genetics classes. It could be readily adapted for general biology, abnormal psychology, counseling, or nutrition. It is helpful for students to have prior knowledge about the theme of nature-nurture as well as familiarity with the basic concepts of scientific thinking including hypothesis formulation and the determination of cause and effect.

AB  - The article provides the basis for a model of inquiry-based science education in which K-12 teachers' and pupils' engage in authentic science experiences as participants of a scientific research project, which we refer to as Multiple Outcome Interdisciplinary Research and Learning (MOIRL). We provide the basis for the model for inquiry based science education (IBSE) by first describing how the model came about through our 10 years of research on how people learn to do science in research groups. We then turn to the literature on the relationship among scientific inquiry, inquiry learning and MOIRL. As our case studies of MOIRL projects show, by being participants along with scientists and their graduate/undergraduate students in authentic scientific research, school pupils learn how to do science and gain a better understanding of scientific concepts. Productive disciplinary engagement can be fostered with learning environments that are problematic in the sense that they encourage students to ask and seek answers to intellectual questions. By incorporating as many stakeholders and outcomes as possible, the likelihood increases of pupils' learning of science concepts and processes. In addition, the incorporation of multiple stakeholders and outcomes provides pupils with a view of the many authentic ways that science and scientific inquiry is connected to the world outside of school, which increases the likelihood that they study more science and aspire to scientific careers. Finally, the MOIRL projects provide teachers with the opportunity to engage in scientific research, which can better prepare them to teach science as inquiry and through the use of inquiry methods.

AB  - The local environment can be explored to sustain effective sustainability learning. With this aim, new learning methodologies can be fostered, namely mobile and game-based learning, as is the case of the EduPARK app. This app supports innovative learning strategies through treasure hunt games, integrating multimedia and augmented reality resources, in natural spaces. This paper presents a pilot case study of a pedagogical approach based on the exploration of a game in the EduPARK app, in the outdoors. The game was developed to be explored in the largest annual event of the University of Aveiro (UA)--XPERiMENTA 2022--where students of several ages and the wider community are invited to participate in diverse activities on the campuses. The main goal of the activity "XPERiMENTA with EduPARK in the UA Campus" was to raise basic education students' awareness towards nature conservation. Eighteen students (14 and 15 years-old) explored an interdisciplinary educational game that encouraged them to follow a path through the UA Campuses to promote learning related to recycling, renewable energies, food waste, and ocean plastic pollution. Simultaneously, curricular contents of Science, Mathematics, Education for Citizenship, and cultural aspects of the city of Aveiro were articulated. At the end of the activity, an individual and anonymous questionnaire to evaluate the activity was applied. Students revealed a positive attitude towards the EduPARK app, as their answers revealed they felt motivated to learn during the game. Additionally, students reached a good performance in the game, although difficulties in one specific question were identified. This paper presents preliminary results that will inform the development of a new related project, the EduCITY, that aims to promote education for sustainability through a smart learning city environment.

AB  - In earlier studies, it has been argued that drama has the potential to stimulate learning in science. However, it is not widely used, one reason being that science teachers are not familiar with this instructional strategy. In this study, it was investigated how pre-service teachers in science developed dramas related to content in a biology course. The research question included how the pre-service teachers reflected on drama as an instructional strategy to stimulate conceptual understanding about cells and cell processes, both for themselves and for their future students. Ten pre-service teachers participated, all in their first year of studies to become teachers at secondary school. Data were collected in the form of student reports and video-recordings, showing the dramas they had created served as complements confirming the reports. The reports were analysed based on the tool Content Representations. The results showed that despite the fact that the pre-service teachers previously had never experienced drama in their science education, and that they identified critical aspects of using drama in science, they were positive about using drama in science education. Some of the pre-service teachers also argued that the use of drama helped them in their own understanding of cell processes.

AB  - This paper describes analyses of the K-12 computational thinking (CT) integration activities collected at two NSF-funded workshops, "Developing an Interdisciplinary Framework for Integrating Computational Thinking in K-12 Science, Mathematics, Technology, and Engineering Education," held in August and November of 2017 at Education Development Center, Inc., in Waltham, Massachusetts. The workshops convened a working group of principal investigators, researchers, and educators from the National Science Foundation (NSF) ITEST (Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers) and STEM + C (STEM + Computing) funded projects to draft an interdisciplinary framework for integrating CT into K-12 education. The goal of this paper is to share that framework and our findings on promising learning progressions, gaps that exist in the collected set of activities, specific advances in STEM fields that were made possible through CT, and suggested ways that CT integration in K-12 can evolve to reach what the CT integration framework proposes as five "computational thinking integration elements" or "CTIEs". This framework is designed to help educators see ways to engage students in CT within disciplinary learning. The analyses and findings may benefit STEM and computing education fields by elucidating the target of CT as used within CT-integrated STEM fields.

AB  - Topology optimization (TO) has been a useful engineering tool over the last decades. The benefits of this optimization method are several, such as the material and cost savings, the design inspiration, and the robustness of the final products. In addition, there are educational benefits. TO is a combination of mathematics, design, statics, and the finite element method (FEM); thus, it can provide an integrative multi-disciplinary knowledge foundation to undergraduate students in engineering. This paper is focused on the educational contributions from TO and identifies effective teaching methods, tools, and exercises that can be used for teaching. The result of this research is the development of an educational framework about TO based on the CDIO (Conceive, Design, Implement, and Operate) Syllabus for CAD engineering studies at universities. TO could be easily adapted for CAD designers in every academic year as an individual course or a module of related engineering courses. Lecturers interested in the introduction of TO to their courses, as well as engineers and students interested in TO in general, could use the findings of this paper.

AB  - This study focuses on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education teachers' perspectives on integrating indigenous knowledge systems (IKS) into a multidisciplinary STEM framework to promote sustainability. The aim is to understand how integrating the values, ethics and worldviews of the global community can contribute to a sustainable mindset. Through an examination of the research background and pedagogical foundations, as well as a review of existing literature, it becomes evident that teachers' perspectives are pivotal in fostering a sustainable mindset among students. To encourage social dialogue that has the potential to evolve teachers' perspectives, a 6 month workshop focused on dialogic argumentation was provided to a group of basic education and university STEM teachers. The workshop aimed to explore the evidence- and reasoning-based arguments that influenced their perspectives regarding the role of IKS in STEM education. Analysis of data collected through questionnaires and interviews yielded the following findings: (a) initially, most teachers had mixed feelings about the role of IKS in STEM education for sustainable development; (b) a significant number of teachers reported that the dialogic argumentation workshop helped them transition from a negative to a positive attitude towards acknowledging the complexity of the role of IKS in promoting various approaches to achieving sustainability goals; and (c) several others, particularly university teachers, attributed IKS with the potential to enhance reflective reasoning in order to solve complex sustainability problems. The implications of these findings for classroom practice, particularly in terms of utilising IKS to enhance STEM teacher education, are highlighted in the paper.

AB  - Despite the interest, curiosity and the enthusiasm of the large public for Astronomy as a scientific discipline, it is absent from the current Romanian curriculum. We present here the results of two surveys that involve parents and teachers and show the necessity, the relevance and the usefulness of including astronomy as a discipline in the curriculum, or at least astronomical related content. We emphasize the interdisciplinary character of Astronomy and suggest using Astronomy as a tool in motivating students towards science and in integrating the science curriculum. Astronomy is amazingly the oldest interdisciplinary approach to science and a most natural way of curriculum integration.

AB  - Environmental stewardship education, as a locally oriented concept, benefits from being recast to account for the emergent, multidimensional, and interdisciplinary nature of today's most pressing socio-ecological issues. In an effort to infuse environmental stewardship education with global citizenship, instructional materials on community-based conservation in Peru were delivered to high school students in New York, USA. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of instructional materials on student learning outcomes related to the practice of global citizenship in environmental stewardship education. The CLIA model for powerful learning environments was used to convey the competencies, learning conditions, interventions, and assessments that structured the delivery of the instructional materials. To evaluate learning outcomes, written student responses were analyzed, using the qualitative coding methodology. Additionally, transformative learning was assessed using the Learning Activities Survey. Results suggest a trajectory past knowledge comprehension and toward transformative, empowered action, progressing from a cognitive understanding to affective and ultimately behavioral shifts. Based on these findings, this study conceptualized and operationalized the concept 21st-century stewardship -- a term coined here as an updated stewardship model that is infused with global citizenship's multi-scalar perspectives, global compacts, and layered identities to achieve its maximum impact in our interconnected world.

AB  - Storytelling via digital media can effectively spotlight pressing societal and environmental concerns. In Hawai'i, these issues encompass addressing climate change impacts and amplifying Indigenous viewpoints within academic contexts. This report discusses "Communicating Creativity," a course offered by the School of Communication and Information at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. This four-week summer intensive course was part of Na Ko'oko'o, a Hawaiian leadership program for Native Hawaiian students and other students with strong commitments to Native Hawaiian communities. Students enrolled in the course spent one week at the Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) on Moku o Lo'e, Kane'ohe Bay, O'ahu. The course aimed to guide students in creating media content (filmmaking) rooted in Hawaiian epistemologies and praxis, bridging Indigenous knowledge with Western scientific perspectives through art, creativity, and visual communication in order to promote interdisciplinary dialogue. Additionally, it featured "talk story" sessions with Native Hawaiian cultural practitioners and HIMB faculty and students, exploring the interface between traditional knowledge and conventional science. This report reflects on lessons learned during the course and underscores the potential of experiential learning to drive socio-ecological change.

AB  - The paper reports about a study that examines changes in teachers' incorporation of epistemic practices in their design of engineering lessons and compares them to their views about the nature of engineering knowledge across 100 hours of professional development. Nineteen K-8 teachers in the USA, who were new to teaching engineering as part of a shift in science learning standards, participated. We focused on four areas of engineering practice and epistemology, namely the orientation of engineering toward solutions, the role of context in defining engineering design specifications, the role and nature of data and evidence, and the interdisciplinary nature of science and engineering. Comparisons of changes in teachers' incorporation of epistemic practices show some reflection of changes in their views about the nature of engineering knowledge. Comparisons suggest that they were able to design instruction with appropriate epistemic practices while not necessarily understanding related features of the nature of engineering.

AB  - In health science education, interprofessional education (IPE) and collaboration (IPC) support the creation of healthcare teams that provide optimal patient care. Despite the need for increased IPE/IPC, most faculty remain siloed by discipline, offering an opportunity for teaching centers to serve as IPE/IPC hubs. This article explores faculty perceptions of how faculty learning communities (FLCs) promote IPE/IPC. Using a qualitative design, researchers administered a survey to FLC participants using purposeful sampling. Thematic analysis of responses revealed that participants do not perceive FLCs as opportunities for IPE/IPC. Findings, however, hold implications for how FLC facilitators can foster IPE/IPC among participants.

AB  - Ill-structured problems abound that require sophisticated problem-solving skills, knowledge across multiple domains and the abilities to think critically and communicate effectively. Despite the abundance of rhetoric supporting the need to build these skills in our students, the acquisition of domain-specific knowledge is still the primary focus of most disciplines. Students who have not mastered these skills and possess only domain-specific knowledge will be underprepared to successfully contribute to the solutions to these problems. The IDEA Studio at Virginia Tech implemented a transdisciplinary collaborative learning environment in an effort to bring these skills out of the literature and into the real-world classroom. This paper describes our strategies, the dominant themes that drove our course structure, the challenges we faced and the lessons learned.

AB  - This paper presents findings from a quasi-experimental study evaluating future teachers' attitudes and beliefs in response to a cross-curricular university course on evolution and creation bridging biological and Christian theological perspectives. Based on previous findings, we hypothesized that a course providing learning opportunities for epistemic insight within this multidisciplinary arena might have effects on attitudes and beliefs relevant to the field. Hence, the main research question was the following: To what extent do student teachers' attitudes and beliefs change by attending a cross-curricular course on evolution and creation intended to develop student teachers' epistemic insight into the nature of science and into the relationship between science and theology? The answer from this quasi-experimental evaluation study (pre-post-design; test group n = 26, control group n = 24) is as follows: It depends upon the variable investigated! Pre-post-analysis using a repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the cross-curricular course integrating epistemic insight induced changes in creationist beliefs, in students' perception of conflict, and in acceptance of evolution. In contrast, there was no effect on attitudes toward evolutionary theory, on attitudes toward the Biblical accounts of creation, or on scientistic beliefs. However, when student responses were analyzed individually, case-based evidence for belief change in students with scientistic positions emerged. Among the reasons for those different effects, we discuss conceptual differences between attitude and acceptance, features of the student teacher sample, and the particular content of the course explicitly addressing creationism but not scientism. In conclusion, the paper corroborates the role of epistemic insight in the multidisciplinary field of evolution and creation and provides initial evidence that epistemic insight possesses a particular potential concerning positions at both ends of the spectrum.

AB  - Background: The Next Generation Science Standards accentuate engineering design along with scientific inquiry, emphasizing the relationship between scientific investigations and engineering design in solving problems and devising new ideas and technologies. The goal is for students to realize the importance of science and engineering in innovation and in solving many of today's challenges. The Next Generation Science Standards contends that a working knowledge and practicality of engineering design prepares students for embracing the challenges of the future. To support students in developing these capabilities, teachers are tasked with the responsibility of facilitating science instruction that integrates science and engineering practices. This is a challenge since a majority of them have little to no understanding of engineering applications. Results: An interdisciplinary team, consisting of science education and mechanical engineering faculty and doctoral students from each discipline, and science, mathematics, and career and technical curriculum supervisors, collaborated with middle school science, mathematics, and career and technical education teachers to develop a framework for integrating engineering practices into their curricula. The exploratory nature of the project, and instructional outcomes with their students, supported teachers in developing an understanding and value for science and engineering practices. As a result, they were motivated to critique and revise their practices, aiming to develop and implement instruction that they perceived as beneficial to their students. Conclusion: With the surge in emphasis on preparing K-12 students for the STEM workforce, initiatives devoted to exposing teachers and students to STEM applications have also increased. The findings from this study could be useful for informing these initiatives, since they reveal the learning experiences of the teachers while processing instructional strategies for integrating science and engineering practices into their curriculum. The findings highlight factors that motivated these teachers to reform their instructional practices, as well as their deliberations while endeavoring to assimilate the strategies into their curricular activities.

AB  - Emerging careers in technology-focused fields such as data science coupled with necessary graduate outcomes mandate the need for a truly interdisciplinary pedagogical approach. However, the rapid pace of curriculum development in this field of inquiry has meant that curricula across universities has largely evolved in line with the internal disciplinary strengths of each institution rather than in response to the needs of graduates. To assist with the development of data science subjects the themes and content that contribute to each subject should be objectively validated. We propose the use of an objective test for data science curricula to quantify whether a particular degree programme maintains an interdisciplinary perspective unconstrained by single discipline bias. The test analyses a given curriculum and quantifies the subject components by category using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present an argument for why there is a need to re-envision the underlying culture of undergraduate biology education to ensure the success, retention, and matriculation of Black students. The basis of this argument is the continued noted challenges with retaining Black students in the biological sciences coupled with existing research that implicates science contexts (i.e., the cultural norms, values, and beliefs manifesting through policies and practices) as being the primary source of the challenges experienced by Black students that lead to their attrition. In presenting this argument, we introduce the Re-Envisioning Culture Network, a multigenerational, interdisciplinary network comprised of higher education administrators, faculty, staff, Black undergraduate students majoring in biology, Black cultural artists, community leaders, and STEM professionals to work together to curate and generate resources and tools that will facilitate change. In introducing the REC Network and disseminating its mission and ongoing endeavors, we generate a clarion call for educators, researchers, STEM professionals, students, and the broader community to join us in this endeavor in fostering transformative change.

AB  - Background: In recent years, computer science education has emerged as a necessary part of school curricula for students of all ages. With such momentum in this direction, it is essential that program designers, educators, and researchers ensure that computer science education is designed to be inclusive, effective, and engaging for all students. Objective: Accordingly, this paper reports on the design and implementation of an inclusive digital learning platform and accompanying curriculum for scaffolding and integrating coding into writing instruction for elementary-aged students (approximately ages 9-12). In this paper, we report on teachers' uses of the Compose and Code (CoCo) platform and curriculum, how students used its features, and its influence on students' computational thinking skills and attitudes about coding. Method: Data analysed in this mixed-methods study come from 11 teachers and 595 students in Grades 3-6. Data sources included teacher reflections and interviews, an assessment of computational thinking for students, and a coding attitudes survey for students. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively and using paired sample t-tests. Qualitative data were analysed inductively using open coding to determine emergent categories. Results and Conclusion: Findings indicate that (1) a majority of students effectively used the CoCo platform to plan their work and code in Scratch, with a smaller percentage using the self-evaluation and self-monitoring features, (2) teachers indicated overall positive perceptions of the CoCo platform and curriculum, with strong support for using it in the future, (3) students' computational thinking skills improved over the course of the project, with results indicating a large effect size (g = 1.24), and (4) student attitudinal results were mixed, providing insights to the barriers that students face when learning to code. Overall, this study indicates that the CoCo platform and curriculum show promise as a scaffolded, structured, and integrated tool for teaching elementary computer science to elementary grade students.

AB  - Background: One approach to enhancing the pedagogy of science education is to employ academics who are not only science-trained but also engaged in education research. As some academics begin their Scholarship of Teaching and Learning research careers with a pure science background, shifting in disciplinary perspectives can be a source of professional tension. The pedagogic frailty model provides a framework that helps us to integrate institutional efforts to enhance teaching improvements by maintaining a simultaneous focus on critical areas that are thought to impede academic development. Purpose: This paper draws attention to the importance of disciplinary crossover by uncovering and comparing academics' teaching perspectives, views and beliefs from three disciplines: natural science (chemistry), social science (education) and science education. Method: Through a case study design using the pedagogic frailty model and concept map-mediated interviews as a tool, three academics engaged in a non-linear discourse in which their conceptions could be visualised and analysed. Findings and Discussion: Analysis of the case study interviews indicated that the academics' conceptions of teaching were highly individualised. The discourse surrounding the curriculum, and the embeddedness of and connection between pedagogy and discipline, were both subject-sensitive and influenced by professional backgrounds and research areas. On the other hand, because they operated under the same institutional values and regulations, we found a considerable overlap in terms of how the academics perceived the tensions between research and teaching and academic leadership. By comparing three academics who were at a different stage in the journey from disciplinary experts (chemistry) to teaching expert (education), we were able to uncover and understand more about the ways that the teaching environment impacted upon their practices. The science educator shared aspects of the other two perspectives, which suggests that his profile was a transitory state in comparison with the chemist and the educationist. Conclusion: The findings provide a glimpse of the distinctive nature of the values that underpin teaching and offer insights that can be used to promote dialogue about quality enhancement in science education.

AB  - Professionals in the environmental domain require cognitive interdisciplinary skills to be able to develop sustainable solutions to environmental problems. We demonstrate that education in environmental systems analysis allows for the development of these skills. We identify three components of cognitive interdisciplinary skills: (1) the ability to understand environmental issues in a holistic way, taking into account the interplay of social and biophysical dynamics; (2) the ability to connect both the analysis of environmental problems and the devising of solutions with relevant disciplinary knowledge and methodologies; and (3) the ability to reflect on the role of scientific research in solving societal problems. Environmental systems analysis provides tools, methods, and models to assist in framing complex environmental issues in a holistic way and facilitates the integration of disciplines. Systems analysis also supports reflection by making students aware that a system always represents a simplified model and a particular perspective. Through the analysis of a collection of bachelor of science students' "reflection papers", we identify two major challenges in teaching these cognitive skills: (1) to train students to not just follow a systematic approach but acquire a systemic view and (2) to train students to be reflexive about systems analysis and the role of science. We recommend that training in cognitive skills starts early in a study program.

AB  - This research methods Essay details the usefulness of critical theoretical frameworks and critical mixed-methodological approaches for life sciences education research on broadening participation in the life sciences. First, I draw on multidisciplinary research to discuss critical theory and methodologies. Then, I demonstrate the benefits of these approaches for researchers who study diversity and inclusion issues in the life sciences through examples from two critical mixed-methods studies of prominent issues in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) participation and recognition. The first study pairs critical discourse analysis of the STEM workforce literature, data, and underlying surveys with quantitative analyses of STEM pathways into the workforce. This example illustrates the necessity of questioning popular models of retention. It also demonstrates the importance of intersecting demographic categories to reveal patterns of experience both within and between groups whose access to and participation in STEM we aim to improve. The second study's critical approach applies research on inequities in prizes awarded by STEM professional societies toward organizational change. This example uses data from the life sciences professional societies to show the importance of placing data within context to broaden participation and understand challenges in creating sustainable change.

AB  - The study examined the use of quality teaching and learning resources and how these affect the teaching and learning of Integrated Science. A total of 172 randomly selected second year Senior High School (SHS) students and 25 Integrated Science teachers purposively sampled served as the subjects for the study within six districts in the Central Region of Ghana. Questionnaires were used to collect the students' and teachers' needed data. This study's key findings revealed a lack of teaching and learning materials and the stereotyped nature of Integrated Science teachers' methods of teaching. It was noted that access, selection and usage of good and quality teaching and learning materials and methods influenced learning outcomes of students in SHS Integrated Science. However, it was observed that both government and private school teachers used similar teaching methods in delivering the Integrated Science content. It was concluded that for successful teaching and learning of Integrated Science, the challenges should be addressed by SHS education stakeholders. As a result, the paper recommended possible solutions that would ameliorate the challenges hindering the teaching and learning of Integrated Science.

AB  - Literature highlights how education in the twenty-first century begins to advocate multiple new concepts, such as new technology, new pedagogies, interdisciplinary curricula, open learning, etc. Among these concepts, the recognition and awareness about one's character strengths are demonstrated to improve emotional management and individual/group's quality of life. We studied three fifth-grade Italian classes using an emerging educational model called IARA to verify if it can truly improve emotional literacy, characters strengths awareness, and cohesion in ten-years children. To demonstrate its efficacy, we used Bloom's Taxonomy and Sociogrammatic study. We proved that the IARA could be an efficient model to improve one's character strengths and class milieu awareness.

AB  - This article explores results from a 3-year model of laboratory instruction, Project Synapse, that synthesized biology, chemistry, and communication curricula for firstyear science majors at a STEMfocused university. Laboratory biology-chemistry integration was featured at natural intersections where disciplines used similar tools, such as microscopy, or areas where content naturally overlapped, such as the biochemistry of photosynthesis. Communication-related proficiencies, such as lab report writing, were featured across disciplines and in stand-alone writing courses. Faculty perspectives are also part of model analysis using an autoethnographic approach. Primarily qualitative methods were implemented to better understand the participant experience, using Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) as a guiding framework. The most prominent themes that emerged from the data and aligned with statistical findings included the following: (i) The instructors were positioned as collegial teaching and learning partners; (ii) formative lab experiences are pivotal for understanding interdisciplinary nature of science content; and (iii) students viewed communication skills as embedded within science learning.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of an interdisciplinary and intergenerational educational experience in the elderly, in teachers, students and their parents or guardians. Creative Dance and Drama Workshops were articulated with Portuguese, PE, Arts and IT subjects. A total of 20 6th graders, their parents or guardians, five teachers and 15 elders participated in the study. An analysis of 194 free evocations based in the free word association technique was performed, along with 17 semi-structured interviews. From the literary texts "Os Piratas" and "Ulisses", an expressions-based work was proposed, where drama and movement games were explored. Evocations of the central core were of Friendship, Learning, Affection, Solidarity and Interaction. Of the 264 text units analysed, interaction with the elders was highlighted. In the teachers' perception about the subjects and workshops involved in the project, a valorisation of IT and of Portuguese was registered. It is also relevant the amount of references to values and to the Interaction with the elders. This interdisciplinary and intergenerational project has revealed itself valuable for the integral and humanistic training of the students, having also given rise to corporeal artistic and emotional experiences relevant to their well-being.

AB  - Information and communications technology (ICT) shapes life and work in every educational system. Where to place ICT in the pedagogical process and how it affects students' psychosocial and cognitive abilities are questions that do not have one definitive answer. The research addresses the intense introduction of ICT that accords with educational trends and the requirements of today's society, but sometimes neglects social competences and any potential psychosocial effects. A need for new and effective methods in upbringing and education to offer everyone, equal opportunities become more and more important in the "world of the 21st century". The research also proved that innovative didactic methods of teaching (4.0) using a transdisciplinary model and supported by state-of-the-art information and communications technology as well as cooperative learning, have a positive psychosocial effect on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) students. Students who experience innovative didactic teaching supported by ICT reach higher taxonomic, cognitive and social standards of competence and are thus better prepared for the challenges of future society.

AB  - In this paper, we trace selected strands of the German path to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). We start by addressing pre-ESD research, and move to the concept of "Gestaltungskompetenz," the core concept of German ESD. The concept had to be realigned as to become more compatible with international research on learning outcomes (competencies). Compared to its beginnings, the meaning of "Gestaltungskompetenz" has much advanced, e.g., influenced by German competence research in science education, to which the Göttingen Model for socioscientific reasoning and decision making contributes. The paper presents a new competence dimension on "Evaluating and reflecting solutions quantitatively-economically" for this model. The contribution highlights the integrative and interdisciplinary scope of the educational challenges posed by Sustainable Development.

AB  - Many arts-focused colleges and universities in the United States offer their undergraduate students coursework in science. To better understand the delivery of science education at this type of institution, this article surveys the science programs of forty-one arts-oriented schools. The findings suggest that most science programs are located in general education departments alongside other liberal arts disciplines, and at most of the schools students are required to complete at least one science course. The findings also suggest that the context of science education at arts-focused colleges may encourage innovation in pedagogy and curriculum development. This article highlights courses and assignments from Emerson College and other schools in which scientific topics are aligned with arts fields or framed to emphasize the societal relevance of science and its place in our daily lives.

AB  - In this special issue, the authors purport to interrogate and further their understanding of the commonly cited term, "design," specifically "learner-generated designs." This issue brings together scholars from multiple disciplines, including learning sciences, literacy studies, science education, digital media, and pedagogy, to examine the notion of "learner-generated designs" in both formal and informal learning environments. Multidisciplinary perspectives provide ways of understanding how learners take hold of their culture of learning, shaping it to be more participatory, communicative, collaborative, and digital. The authors argue that "learner-generated designs" provide opportunities for learners to bring in their objects or ideas of significance to engage in pedagogic discourse with their peers and teachers or mentors. "Learner-generated designs" focus the discourse on the learners' ways of being, doing, and knowing; identity; and embodied experiences of artifacts in different domains of their lives. This commentary will draw on the authors' research to elucidate the notion of "learner-generated designs."

AB  - The article deals with the development of collaborative problem-solving (CPS) abilities of pre-service science teachers using the following stepwise problem-solving (SPS) strategies: (1) identification (this stage presupposes identification of fundamental problems), (2) solution (this stage in essence involves implementation) and (3) checking (this stage mainly comprises monitoring, setting and controlling). The research on the development of pre-service teachers' collaborative problem-solving abilities was based on cross-curricular content (Biology, Chemistry or Physics). SPS strategies were implemented in different steps of the cross-curricular problem-solving activity. The first strategy (identification) encompassed the following steps: discussions and careful investigation of knowledge, deepening of one's knowledge, definition of the problem, formulation of the hypothesis of problem solution, "brain storming", concretization of the problem and creation of a group plan. The second strategy (solution) involved three steps: management of information, explanation of problem solution and practical application of experience. The self-evaluation of the pre-service teachers was performed at the end of each stage. The quantitative study revealed that CPS abilities of the pre-service science teachers corresponding to the second problem-solving strategy (implementation) were higher than the problem-solving abilities of the first problem-solving strategy (identification). The results of the qualitative research highlighted the role of collaboration at the cross-curricular problem-solving activity.

AB  - Civic education in undergraduate institutions is of vital importance to the civic health of society, but faculty often find it difficult to incorporate civic components into existing courses and lack the resources to incorporate civic outreach into their curriculum. As a result, research has shown that time spend on civic engagement is limited. Additionally, civic engagement is rarely discussed, much less encouraged, outside of political science or other social science classes. In this article, we assess the outcomes of a unique co-curricular civic engagement research and learning program in which undergraduate students are required to work with an external partner, usually a municipal agency or nonprofit, to complete an independent research project. Using quantitative and qualitative student evaluations, we find that students had an overwhelmingly positive experience with the program. They especially appreciated the opportunity to work on "real world" issues in an interdisciplinary setting. They also expressed a desire for a longer program that extended beyond a single semester. We discuss the potential implications of these findings.

AB  - The interdisciplinary subject of agricultural biochemistry can provide an abundance of didactic opportunities for educators teaching biochemistry and molecular biology in secondary-level science courses. This is especially true in present times when virtual-learning strategies supersede in-person instruction and contemporary approaches are needed to engage students with relevant applications of science. In this communication, we discuss how pairing daily lessons in agricultural biochemistry with periodic e-notebook usage further refines this strategy by promoting content-retrieval and providing educators with formative feedback on student progress in a simple and inexpensive manner.

AB  - Some level of understanding of and about nanoscience and nanotechnology (NST) has been suggested as being relevant in up-to-date scientific literacy for all. Research scientists working in these fields are central in current efforts to inform and engage the public in NST. Earlier research has shown that scientists can contribute to authentic science learning, but communication always entails roles that affect the choice of content. This study investigated NST researchers' views on the nature of their research and their preferences in NST communication. Eight experienced professors working in various fields of NST were interviewed. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews focused on the scientists' views on (1) the nature of their research, and (2) aspects of NST that should be communicated to the public. Qualitative content analysis of the interviews revealed that the themes the interviewees highlighted when describing their research (interdisciplinarity, size scale, methods, objects, nature of NST in general) were somewhat different from the ones they considered as important for communication to the public (applications and products, risks and benefits, visualizations). The results problematize the simplistic notion that exposure to real scientists would unquestionably enhance the authenticity of science learning. This study gives insight for research and development of science communication, especially scientists' role and training in it.

AB  - Experiential learning provides students the time and space to participate in the process of learning by engaging in real, modern situations. Via hands on activities and reflection, students are able to assimilate new experiences with previous ones, and it has been repeatedly shown to improve student learning. We assessed how ten days of experiential learning in Tanzania, Africa affected student understanding and retainment of fundamental concepts in evolution, ecology, and ethology. We assessed 25 college students (n = 12 biology majors, n = 13 non-biology majors) with a pre- and post-test. The pre-test was announced to the students and given before travel, and a nearly identical post-test was unannounced and given four weeks after travel. Non-biology majors performed at least ~15-30% higher on their post-exam compared to their pre-exam, and biology majors performed 5-10% higher on their post-exam compared to their pre-exam. The success of our interdisciplinary course can partially be attributed to experiential learning, and our results suggest that experiential learning has a particular value to non-majors.

AB  - Interdisciplinary science learning can play a central role in promoting students' 21st century skills. However, students tend to have low perceived self-efficacy towards 21st century skills, thus limiting the application of their actual scientific competence. This study seeks, based on a 1.5-year intervention study, to promote students' perceived self-efficacy towards 21st century skills through science learning compared to a non-experimental group. During the intervention, everyday life-related scenarios were utilized, with students guided to create core idea maps. Data on students' perceived self-efficacy were collected before and after the intervention. Results showed that students' perceived self-efficacy towards 21st century skills changed in a significantly positively way after the intervention.

AB  - With the increasing demand for STEM professionals, together with many of the current STEM professionals approaching or already gone over retiring age, there is a current shortfall which is now an urgent requirement to be addressed by Western countries as so much of activities and life in general is increasingly technology dependent. Actions that are currently being taken to address this shortfall in the UK by academic establishments, organizations and professional bodies are considered in this paper. Some of these include those actions that are directed at encouraging a better gender balance in the future as well as those involving actions to attract students to be aware of STEM from an early age to supporting women returning to the STEM profession. Parts of our research examines the learning and studying approaches adopted by some of the learners, their levels of attainment and attitude to learning to use technology and using technology to improve their learning. The paper reports on the developments and improvements from some of these initiatives and activities implemented. Some of these actions include details of competitions from primary to postgraduate students, women only training sessions, online support groups for STEM women, ranging from technical to career and social issues, and details of CAS (Computing At School) support for teachers, both face to face and online, currently with over 30,000 CAS participants. In conclusion the paper reflects on a roll out of some of these activities and potential impact on enhancing interest and uptake of STEM subjects by both the young and older learners and across diverse levels of education.

AB  - Increasing the scientific knowledge of the population through education is a development strategy towards a sustainable future. However, there is no equity in the access to science education and scientific knowledge. The aim of this paper is to present and analyse a science kit named "Energy, Environment and Sustainability" (KEAS). Based on research conducted in Guinea-Bissau, it explores strategies to promote science education for a sustainable future. The strengths and limitations of the KEAS were studied using different data collection methods, including interviews, observation, survey, focus groups and document analysis. The participants were teacher trainers from the Guinea-Bissau School of Education. It is concluded that the KEAS is a feasible and suitable teaching strategy appropriate to the context, having the potential to contribute to learning about the environment and sustainability. Further, it addresses real problems for which students should acquire knowledge and skills in order to be able to make informed choices.

AB  - Programming is an interdisciplinary practice with applications in both mathematics and computer science. Mathematics concerns rigor, abstraction, and generalization. Computer science predominantly concerns efficiency, concreteness, and physicality. This makes programming a medium for problem solving that mediates between mathematics and computer science in intriguing ways. Behind programming practices is computational thinking (CT), a mode of thinking involved in formulating and solving problems so that the solutions could be represented and carried out by computing means. In this paper, CT is seen as a boundary object connecting mathematics and computer science in a school problem-solving context. In particular, we examine and analyse middle school students' work upon engaging in mathematical problem solving-in a programming environment, taking CT as a boundary object embedded in the block-based programming environment, Scratch. The analysis is guided by observing boundary crossing features of CT in the students' artefacts produced in Scratch while solving mathematical problems related to symmetry and arithmetic sequence. The findings of this study open up new dimensions to explore CT as a boundary object in integrated STEM pedagogy.

AB  - We describe the design and implementation of Project WISE, a multi-institutional partnership that assembles interdisciplinary teams of undergraduate and high school students charged with developing STEM-focused community youth-programs. Our goal is twofold: (i.) to promote young women's interest in STEM-oriented careers through an early, positive exposure to informal science education, and (ii.) to trial-test a model of how high schools, universities, and informal learning centers can collaborate to build strong, successful youth-program partnerships that serve the local community. Our project is innovative in its youth-development strategies, the targeting plan for diverse audiences, and the focus on women's contributions to aviation and space flight. The project also gives student participants rare but powerful opportunities to contribute directly to the quality of life in their community and to work in multi-disciplinary, multi-generational teams.

AB  - One of the main objectives of education, which raises individuals that the society needs, is to resource labor force that will provide the development of the society by maintaining the economic, social, scientific and technological advances. Many countries that aspire to have an advanced economy and technology aim to build a society that is advanced at Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and have sustainable development in these fields, and this has been one of the main educational strategies of those countries. STEM education has a strategic importance for our country to maintain the competitive power on international scale. This research aims to conduct a needs analysis towards the curricular design of STEM education to be proposed for the undergraduate programs of science education at education faculties. The study holds a descriptive model and qualitative methods were used. The study group consists of 12 faculty from Science, Mathematics, Computer and Instructional Technologies at Faculty of Education, and from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering at Gazi University; 15 science teachers who work at the schools which have different socio-economic levels in Ankara, and 42 sophomore students who study at the Department of Science Education at Gazi University Faculty of Education. Content analysis was used as the data analysis method. Findings of the study reveal that there are no studies conducted to integrate different fields into teacher education programs, there are no courses related to STEM education integrated into the curriculum, and the knowledge and skills pre-service teachers should gain to implement this approach in their professional teaching career do not exist in the curriculum. In addition, it was found that most of the teachers believe teacher collaboration; they associate their courses mostly with mathematics and information technologies. Likewise, it was identified that the main reason behind why the teachers cannot teach through interdisciplinary approach is due to teacher related reasons. Concerning the pre-service education, The Ministry of National Education and education faculties should work collaboratively, determine the teacher competencies and try to develop undergraduate curriculum for pre-service teachers to gain these competencies. Training teachers during pre-service period rather than in-service training will play a crucial role to gain the expected results from the approach.

AB  - Interest has grown in the past few years about the place of social work in science. Questions remain, such as whether social work should be considered a science, and if so, where it fits into the constellation of sciences. This article attempts to shed light on these questions. After briefly considering past and present constructions of science and reflecting on views of science within the social work profession over time, we present an argument for how social work contributes to predominant questions facing science today through its unique ability to draw together and integrate knowledge from a variety of disciplines. Finally, we address how the profession can best prepare the coming generation of social workers to operate to their full potential in the current transdisciplinary world of science.

AB  - With integrated curricula and multidisciplinary assessments becoming more prevalent in medical education, there is a continued need for educational research to explore the advantages, consequences, and challenges of integration practices. This retrospective analysis investigated the number of items needed to reliably assess anatomical knowledge in the context of gross anatomy and histology. A generalizability analysis was conducted on gross anatomy and histology written and practical examination items that were administered in a discipline-based format at Indiana University School of Medicine and in an integrated fashion at the University of Alabama School of Medicine and Rush University Medical College. Examination items were analyzed using a partially nested design [sx(i:o)] in which items were nested within occasions (i:o) and crossed with students (s). A reliability standard of 0.80 was used to determine the minimum number of items needed across examinations (occasions) to make reliable and informed decisions about students' competence in anatomical knowledge. Decision study plots are presented to demonstrate how the number of items per examination influences the reliability of each administered assessment. Using the example of a curriculum that assesses gross anatomy knowledge over five summative written and practical examinations, the results of the decision study estimated that 30 and 25 items would be needed on each written and practical examination to reach a reliability of 0.80, respectively. This study is particularly relevant to educators who may question whether the amount of anatomy content assessed in multidisciplinary evaluations is sufficient for making judgments about the anatomical aptitude of students.

AB  - Reform efforts in different parts of the world call for the adoption of integrated approaches to STEM education. However, little is known about how teachers work, as members of learning communities, to design STEM teaching material such as lesson plans. To address this gap in the literature, we examined the design of STEM lesson plans by in-service secondary teachers (n = 26) from all S-T-E-M disciplinary backgrounds who participated as members of a learning community in the context of a 7-month professional development program comprised of 13 small-group sessions. STEM lesson plans were analysed based on the key characteristics of a conceptual framework of integrated STEM, and the teachers' identified interdisciplinary elements were analysed through the boundary objects framework. The qualitative content analysis produced four main findings: (a) divergencies take place at the disciplinary level when teachers design STEM lesson plans; (b) teachers coming from different disciplines have different positioning regarding specific integrated STEM key characteristics; (c) the type and sequence of instructional activities served as a boundary-design practice; (d) the nature of the boundary objects that teachers identify in order to teach integrated STEM differs according to the discipline. The findings of the study shed light on teachers' understanding and needs at the disciplinary level and call for specially designed STEM professional development programmes that provide explicit opportunities for disciplinary boundary crossings.

AB  - To recruit underrepresented students with demonstrated financial need into STEM disciplines, Lock Haven University established the interdisciplinary Nano Scholars Program, offering National Science Foundation-funded scholarships, academic support, and social support. Small cohort sizes, a student-led science learning community (the Nano Club), and mentored undergraduate research fostered academic and cocurricular student engagement. Nano Scholars outperformed matched control peers on overall GPA, average number of credits per semester, graduation in 4 years, and graduate school placement rates. A comprehensive program fostering engagement through individualized attention, a robust learning community, meaningful research opportunities, and peer and alumni support is essential.

AB  - This paper describes the development and implementation of engaging and supportive experiences to promote student engagement, persistence, and success at a commuter, open enrollment, public, minority-serving institution. Project components included faculty development at the SENCER Summer Institute (SSI) 2016, attended by a team comprised of an academic administrator, full-time faculty from English and math, and part-time faculty in chemistry; creation of a virtual learning community of freshmen enrolled in chemistry, English, and math, linked by the specific theme of the environmental impacts of de-icing roads with salt and the overarching theme of the impacts of human activities on the environment; and peer mentoring in chemistry. Faculty reflections and grade distributions indicate this is a promising approach and suggest strategies for overcoming challenges.

AB  - As the use of data in courses that incorporate statistical methods has become more prevalent, so has the need for tools for working with such data, including those for data creation and adjustment. While numerous tools exist that support faculty who teach statistical methods, many are focused on data analysis or theoretical concepts, and there remains a need for tools that assist faculty when making data-based examples and assignments. In this article, we describe a free application, available both online and through an R package, which we developed for instructors of courses that incorporate introductory statistical methods. The app treats the process of coming up with data for examples and assignments synergistically, beginning with either data creation (through random number generation) or adjustment (when the user has data) and ending with an assessment of the data's suitability for the desired analysis. The app enables the quick creation of many versions of variables for multiple versions of assignments and is compatible with file types associated with popular interdisciplinary software such as Excel, R, and SPSS. We highlight the app's features and discuss survey feedback provided by faculty that demonstrates the desire and need for and effectiveness of such an app. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

AB  - Over the course of 3 years, the Political Science and Biology Programs at a regional HBCU have built a curricular learning community centered on a mock trial competition, where a microbiology course was paired with an introductory legal studies course. Over the course of a semester, students enrolled in both courses studied a real appellate case that dealt with some aspect of forensic science (DNA evidence for example). The legal studies students were to act as prosecution and defense and the microbiology students played the role of expert witnesses and consultants. To be successful, students had to build an interdisciplinary team, outline their side's case, and learn scientific and legal principles. This paper evaluates the impact of this experience on student learning using a mixed-methods approach. Students completed a self-reported knowledge survey and participated in a focus group debriefing session. Students report important gains in understanding the legal system and aspects of forensic science.

AB  - Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) are attractive solutions for scaling undergraduate research experiences at primarily undergraduate teaching institutions, where resources for faculty research activities can be limited. The Sustainable Interdisciplinary Research to Inspire Undergraduate Success (SIRIUS) project is a unique program that integrates CUREs, coordinated around a local real-world problem, throughout a biology department's curricula. The CUREs are scaffolded to provide all biology majors with multiple opportunities to engage in scientific investigations as they advance through introductory, intermediate, and advanced courses. In this mixed methods, cross-sectional study, we explore students' perceptions of the authenticity of their experiences as they progress through the SIRIUS CUREs. Triangulated data collected from two instruments indicated that students in advanced courses recognized more involvement in research activities and perceived greater authenticity in the science they were performing compared with introductory and intermediate students. Intermediate and advanced students perceived more opportunities for independence; however, experiences with failure and the influence these experiences had on the perceptions of authenticity was primarily observed with advanced students. This study contributes to the growing literature on CUREs with a focus on students from a primarily undergraduate institution with multiple minority-serving designations.

AB  - This work describes an experience conducted by a group of professors from different departments at the University of Girona (Catalonia, Spain) which arose from the need for interdisciplinary work in university classrooms in order to promote competences relevant to the professional sector. As part of this experience, students from different degree programs were challenged to work collaboratively and in an interdisciplinary manner on a project related to the management of a school cafeteria designed for a real educational center. The work promoted the development of competences that are otherwise difficult to attain through activities that lack an interdisciplinary approach, which are key in today's professional world, such as multi-professional teamwork. Based on this experience, the feasibility of students from different areas of study carrying out a final degree project (FDP) that meets real, contextualized needs and requires the contribution of knowledge from different disciplines is considered.

AB  - Generations of students are graduating from secondary school disinterested in post-secondary study of science or pursuing careers in science-related fields beyond formal education. We propose that destabilising such disinterest among future students requires science educators to begin listening to secondary school students regarding their views of how science learning is made interesting within the science classroom. Studies on students' interest in response to instructional strategies applied in the classroom communicate the opinions (i.e. the "voice") of students about the strategies they believe make their classroom learning interesting. To this end, this scoping study (1) collects empirical studies that present from various science and non-science academic domains students' views about how to make classroom learning interesting; (2) identifies common instructional strategies across these domains that make learning interesting; and (3) forwards an instructional framework called TEDI ([T]ransdisciplinary Connections; Mediated [E]ngagement; Meaningful [D]iscovery; and Self-determined [I]nquiry), which may provide secondary school science teachers with a practical instructional approach for making learning science genuinely interesting among their students within the secondary school science classroom context.

AB  - The Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter (LRSM), University of Pennsylvania, was built in 1965 as part of the Advanced Research Projects Agency's (ARPA) Interdisciplinary Laboratories (IDL) program intended to foster interdisciplinary research and training in materials science. The process that led to the construction of the four-story structure served as the focus of intense debates over the meaning and process of interdisciplinary research in universities. The location of the building, its size, internal design, and functionalities were all subject to heated negotiations among patrons, scientists, and university administrators, to find the proper place of interdisciplinary materials science on the University of Pennsylvania's campus. Building on the recent work on laboratory architecture, this paper argues that the negotiations and controversies over the LRSM building were concrete representations of the broader struggle over the appropriate place of interdisciplinary research and training within a university.

AB  - Because present initiatives guiding educational decision-making place a high emphasis on accountability, there was a need to explore the educational value of the literacy and science education courses' joint interdisciplinary focus for elementary education. With current research alluding to time constraints, scripted curriculum, and memorization dominating teachers' decisions about instruction, it seemed important to gain insight into the practical nature of the interdisciplinary method with former students. Former pre-service teachers in their first years of teaching were surveyed. The goal was to find out how the interdisciplinary strategies influenced their instruction and students' learning, and if they were continuing to meaningfully chunk their curriculum. Twenty-five of the forty former pre-service teachers returned the survey. These first-year teachers reported making cross-curricular connections and articulated a range of benefits for their students. However, they also discussed hindrances to their attempts at making cross-curricular connections, including state and local mandates, time constraints, and dilemmas related to being a first-year teacher. The findings from this study could prove valuable to teacher educators in elementary education programs, as well as to those involved in planning and facilitating professional development activities for elementary school teachers.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to evaluate the potential of use for computer science course designs (CSCD) created by game-based learning method. Qualitative case study was used as the research design. CSCDs created for Minecraft Education Edition (MinecraftEdu) were examined in the context of various criteria by document analysis method, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with teachers actively using MinecraftEdu in their classes. The research revealed that the CSCDs created for MinecraftEdu primarily aimed at developing coding and design skills, underscored interdisciplinary collaboration, laid more emphasis on cognitive-psychomotor achievements with curriculum eligibility. It was acknowledged that introduction, body and conclusion parts have an elaborate design in majority of course designs according to Gagné's Events of Instruction Model, and yet, more attention should be paid to gaining the learner's attention, stimulating recall of prior learning, giving feedback, and ensuring retention and transfer. Despite increasing interest and trend towards educational games and game-based learning environments, there are limited number of studies that can help teachers evaluate the games that can be most effective in their fields and different learning contexts. Therefore, it is anticipated that this study will contribute to the related literature on game-based course designs and applicability.

AB  - Successfully creating and implementing interdisciplinary curricula in introductory science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses is challenging, but doing so is increasingly more important as current problems in science become more interdisciplinary. Opening up the silos between science disciplines and overcoming common institutional barriers (cost, limited time, need to deliver specific course content, and lack of faculty commitment) is possible by bringing students together from different science courses to discuss interesting interdisciplinary problems. This article describes the mobilization and implementation of a community-oriented Interdisciplinary Science Seminar (ISS) that adds interdisciplinary content to traditional introductory science courses without a significant investment of additional resources. In addition, increased faculty collaboration on interdisciplinary curriculum was achieved, and a second new student-oriented interdisciplinary science program was created.

AB  - STEM education has become a global priority as governments realise that there are important economic benefits if students engage in this interdisciplinary curriculum area. Less prominence has been given to the community benefits that STEM education can bring and even less attention has been given to the potential for children's learning of STEM to increase adults' understanding of environmental issues. Purpose: This study examined how an interdisciplinary STEM education unit of work was implemented in a primary school to educate children's families and the school community about a little known but significant issue: the plight of honey bees. Sample: The paper reports on two primary school teachers and their classes who were engaging in a STEM unit of work. The children were aged nine and ten years old and the school was in a metropolitan location. The unit of work being taught focussed on creating an education game to highlight the importance of honey bees. Design and methods: Using a case study design multiple sources of data were collected including video, semi structured interviews, and work samples over the course of eight lessons. The data analysis involved an iterative model of video analysis integrated with analysis of student games and community interviews. Results: The multiple sources of data suggested that the extended learning module was able to support the development of student understanding of the plight of honey bees and that children were able to transform their learning into board games that enabled the children to inform and inspire the local community. Conclusion: These findings offer insights into how children can transform their learning into a resource and then can use this resource to educate a school community about a complex and significant environmental issue.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a prominent topic in K-12 education recently. However, pedagogical design has remained a major challenge, especially among young learners. Guided by the Zone of Proximal Development theory and AI education research literature, this design-based study proposes an analogy-based pedagogical approach to support AI teaching and learning in upper primary education. This pedagogical approach is centered on human-AI comparison, where humans are gradually shifted from an analogue to a contrast to make visible the attributes, mechanisms, and processes of AI. To evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experimental study with mixed methods was conducted. The quantitative comparison shows that the participants in the experimental group learning with the analogy-based pedagogical approach significantly outperformed their peers with the conventional direct instructional approach in all three dimensions of AI knowledge, skills, and ethical awareness. Qualitative analyses further reveal its pedagogical benefits, including demystifying AI through relatable and engaging learning, supporting student comprehension and skill mastery, and nurturing critical thinking and attitudes. The analogy-based approach contributes to the field of K-12 AI education with an age-appropriate, child-friendly pedagogical approach. Notably, AI education should prioritize teaching for student understanding, and AI should be recognized as an independent subject with interdisciplinary applications.

AB  - Interdisciplinary field study courses at 2-year colleges can provide an opportunity to enhance student learning. The authors present here an 11-day interdisciplinary field-study course designed for nonscience majors at a 2-year college. Using a theoretical learning framework that emphasizes cognitive and metacognitive gains, the field study curriculum is designed to incorporate both geology and biology topics illustrating the cross-discipline nature of science education. The course allows students to travel to classic geologic locales that provide a means of science immersion in a more active learning and inquiry based atmosphere. Students are encouraged to ask questions about nature, formulate hypotheses for answering those questions, and evaluate conclusions. Additionally the course provides an opportunity for students to refine observation and inquiry skills beyond a set of laboratory exercises and classroom lectures. An end-of-course survey was used to capture students' perceived value of the course.

AB  - The Inclusive Environments and Metrics in Biology Education and Research (iEMBER) network is a newly forming national community of practice that engages diversity, equity, and inclusion stakeholders in interdisciplinary collaborative projects. iEMBER was initiated with incubator funding from the National Science Foundation program for Research Coordination Networks in Undergraduate Biology Education. In June 2017, biology education researchers, social scientists, biologists, and program and policy administrators, all with interests in diversity, equity, and inclusion, met to lay the foundation for the iEMBER network. iEMBER provides a distinct forum to coordinate efforts through networking, professional development, and the initiation of collaborative research. iEMBER advances science, technology, engineering, and mathematics reform focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion through the initiation of research teams at the iEMBER biennial conference and outreach efforts at discipline-specific meetings and conferences. The focus of iEMBER is on understanding how to create inclusive, supportive, and engaging environments to foster the success of all biology students and trainees. This report focuses on the structure of the iEMBER network, two takeaways that emerged from the 2017 conference (interdisciplinary networking/collaboration and intradisciplinary broadening participation strategies), and ways for prospective members to engage in ongoing dialogue and future events.

AB  - Primary school teachers need adequate professional knowledge and motivational orientations to qualify scientifically and technologically literate students. Previous studies have focused on the impact of coursework on (pre-service) primary teachers' content knowledge, rather than on the development of academic self-concepts. In addition, the influence of the course format and the major field of study has not been investigated much to this date. Thus, this study examines the effects of an interdisciplinary course on pre-service primary teachers' content knowledge and academic self-concepts in science and technology using a quasi-experimental, quantitative, pre-post-follow-up design (n = 202). Whilst no significant changes in knowledge were revealed for the baseline group not participating in the course, significant short-term and long-term cognitive gains were found for the experimental group. Biology-, chemistry-, physics- and technology-related self-concepts increased significantly when participating in the course. The results also indicate that the course format and major field of study can have an impact on the development of pre-service teachers' professional knowledge. Regarding the development of academic self-concepts in the experimental group, it can be assumed that both the weekly and block course format are beneficial for heterogeneous learner groups consisting of pre-service teachers with different major fields of study.

AB  - This paper discusses strategies for promoting literacy and metaliteracy development in international and multicultural classrooms. Drawing on the first author's observational research and the second author's expertise in metaliteracy, we present a case study of international postgraduate students in an interdisciplinary department. The authors synthesize their different areas of work to describe how a fusion of metaliteracy, constructive alignment, and learning oriented assessments (LOA) facilitates student engagement with theories of knowledge organization and extensible markup language (XML) data-encoding standards. Our discussion describes curriculum design and redesign strategies and contextualizes observations about student success. The authors' observations provide a basis for proposing methods for using metaliteracy to implement constructive alignment and LOA methods for promoting collaborative and truly diverse learning.

AB  - The scientific and technological developments in today's world require countries to raise entrepreneurial, productive, critical, problem-solving, and entrepreneurial individuals. Therefore, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education has gained importance today. STEM education is defined as an approach that takes an interdisciplinary relationship and takes a holistic approach to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. STEM education includes the activities that will increase the students' interest and orientations towards science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields using the skills that should be possessed today. The aim of this study was to examine the STEM awareness and entrepreneurship levels of pre-service science teachers. The sample of the study consisted of 93 female and 20 male students studying in the Science Education Department at Afyon Kocatepe University. As a quantitative research type, survey method was used in this study. "STEM Awareness Scale" (SAS) developed by Buyruk and Korkmaz (2016) and "Entrepreneurship Scale for Teacher Candidates" developed by Deveci and Cepni (2015) were used as data collection tools. As a result of analyses, it was seen that science teachers' attitudes towards STEM education were positive. Females' STEM awareness was significantly higher than males' in both positive and negative sub-factors. STEM awareness of the first grade students was significantly lower than the other classes in the positive sub-factor, and significant differences were found between the first grade and second grade, and the second grade and the fourth grade in the negative sub-factor. There were no significant differences of entrepreneurship levels in terms of gender. Also, the entrepreneurship characteristics of the second grade were significantly higher than the other grade levels.

AB  - Data analytics is a rapidly growing field that plays a crucial role in extracting valuable insights from large volumes of data. A data analytics practicum course provides students with hands-on experience in applying data analytics techniques and tools to real-world scenarios. This practicum is intended to serve as a bridge between the student's academic environment and the professional application of their skills in an employment and internship setting. This study examined the design of a data analytics practicum course. The main objectives included (1) the identification of topics and skills employers look for in new hires in data analytics-related internships and entry-level positions, (2) the development and implementation of a Data Analytics practicum course and (3) reflection on the first-time offering of the course and suggested improvements for the next iteration. As part of this study, industry and organization survey responses drove the design of the course and development of key student learning gains for five learning modules throughout the semester. Faculty within the departments of information technology (IT), mathematics, and statistics collaborated in the construction, development, and implementation of team-teaching instructional practices of the Data Analytics Practicum in Spring 2023. This study applies an interdisciplinary approach to data analytics practicum development and instruction.

AB  - Engagement involves students' investment in learning activities, as well as interrelated affective (emotive responses), behavioral (active responses), and cognitive (mental effort) components. This study assessed undergraduate student and instructor perceptions of the interrelated components of engagement during and after the rapid online transition of teaching in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fifteen courses--including laboratory, discussion-based, large lecture, tutorial, and problem-based learning--within a multi-disciplinary faculty at a large research-intensive Canadian university were surveyed to: (a) assess student and instructor perceptions of students' levels of engagement during and after the rapid transition to online teaching due to the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) describe which aspects of engagement were enhanced or diminished due to the rapid online transition; and (c) identify which learning activities students would find most engaging in an online setting so as to assist in developing student-centered online pedagogical techniques. Student engagement was lower after the rapid online transition. Students who engaged by connecting with peers and instructors through in-class discussion (affective engagement) had diminished engagement, whereas students who engaged by listening to lectures, reading course materials, and reviewing slides (cognitive engagement) had enhanced engagement. Overall, students found synchronous activities more engaging. Students experienced positive and negative outcomes related to classroom engagement when transitioning rapidly to online learning during a global pandemic.

AB  - Purpose: Innovation in education is one of the alternative approaches in education to promote creative and higher-order thinking skills, providing hands-on learning and learning in context experience. However, there is a need to combine the ability to produce a commercialised innovation instead, as not many studies have combined innovation and entrepreneurship in an educational approach. This study seeks to examine the pattern of publication, key concepts, citations, and authorship in innovation and entrepreneurship educational research and their collaborations. Methods: This study employed a bibliometric analysis of 1,941 scholarly works related to innovation and entrepreneurship as recorded in the Scopus database on June 20th, 2021, for the past 10 years, starting in 2011. Findings: The findings indicate that since 2011, innovation and entrepreneurship have caught the attention of scholars from both the East and the West, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, and China, and the number of publications has grown consistently over the 10 years after that. Based on the findings, both innovation and entrepreneurship do rely on each other, and a proper curriculum design structure and management must be considered to assimilate these two elements together in any academic subject. Significance: According to the findings, these two elements are best applied at the tertiary level, and if they work together and blend well, they will aid not only in preparing future generations with good entrepreneurial skills but also in economic and sustainable development. However, while this transdisciplinary approach to educational research has been well received in the West, it has yet to be adequately encouraged in the East. There has been healthy cross-country collaboration, but there is a gap in combining innovation and entrepreneurship in educational research from certain countries vis a vis western countries. The findings of this study may have contributed significantly to increasing the inclusivity and global reach of innovation and entrepreneurship in educational research.

AB  - We report on the development of an after-school and summer-based science, technology, engineering, and mathematics curriculum infused with the arts and social emotional learning content (STEAM SEL). Its design was motivated by theory and research that suggest that STEM education is well-suited for teaching empathy and other emotion-related skills. In this paper, we describe the activities associated with the development and design of the program and the curriculum. We provide expert-ratings of the STEAM and social emotional elements of the program and present instructor and participant feedback about the program's content and its delivery. Our results revealed that infusing the arts and social emotional learning content into science education created a holistic STEM-related curriculum that holds potential for enhancing young children's interest in and appreciation for science and its applications. The data also suggested that the program was well-developed and, generally well-executed. However, experts rated the STEAM elements of the program more positively than the SEL elements, especially with regard to sequencing of lessons and integration among the lessons and hands-on activities, indicating that program revisions are warranted.

AB  - As the COVID-19 pandemic became widespread in early 2020, people around the world felt scared, confused, and at a loss for how to help their fellow humans. Suddenly, young and old alike needed to understand the science of virology and how to protect themselves and others, while the world's scientific understanding of the specific COVID-19 virus continued to evolve. In response to this critical need, the Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC) collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the InterAcademy Partnership (IAP) to create a community research guide called "COVID-19! How Can I Protect Myself and Others?," which focused on the protective behaviors necessary to ensure public health. To disseminate this module, the SSEC leveraged a network of partners from around the world who shared the goal of providing high-quality science and STEM education to young people. One key partner was Innovation for Science Education (INNOVEC) based in Mexico. Through the Smithsonian's timely content and the innovative efforts of INNOVEC and others to reach young learners around the globe, "COVID-19! How Can I Protect Myself and Others?" has supported more than 2 million young people in 36 countries to discover, understand, and act in order to protect themselves and others.

AB  - The ability to listen closely, speak clearly, write coherently, read with comprehension, and to create and critique media offerings in science contexts is essential for effective science teaching. How might instructors develop such abilities in a physics course for prospective elementary and middle school teachers? We describe here such a course, involving collaboration among physics, science education, and literacy faculty members and two graduate assistants. Meeting twice a week for 10 weeks, the course emphasized questioning, predicting, exploring, observing, discussing, writing, and reading in physical science contexts. We report common themes about aspects that fostered or hindered science and literacy learning, changes in views about science teaching and learning, and positive shifts in interest in science and intended teaching practices.

AB  - English is widely recognized as an international language for education communication, which has led to the development of several English for Academic Purposes (EAP) subjects for Thai students learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL), especially in specialized school programs. The primary objective of these EAP subjects is to prepare Thai students for academic success in an increasingly interconnected world. Therefore, appropriate learning materials are needed to enhance students' academic language proficiency and ability to engage in interdisciplinary studies. As part of a full research and development project, this preliminary study was conducted to investigate the voices of Thai secondary school students and teachers for theme-based learning materials design in an English for Science and Mathematics (ESM) subject. Focus group and individual interviews were used to explore the experiences and opinions of students and teachers in the Enrichment Program of Science, Mathematics, Technology, and Environment (SMTE). The study identified specific academic English literacy needs, including reading strategies, planning for paragraph writing, sentence structure, knowledge of vocabulary and grammar, and learning materials preferences of the SMTE students. These empirical findings could offer valuable insights for materials developers and English language teachers engaged in designing learning materials for students with specific needs.

AB  - Nowadays, solving problems is substantial for the social relationship human. Computational Thinking (CT) emerges as an interdisciplinary thought process encompassing mental abilities to help students solve and understand problems. Researchers invest in the methodological proposal of activities aimed at CT stimulation, educational approaches, and the conception of technologies that support these activities' execution. Educational Robotics (ER) is one of these technologies that stand out at different educational levels to favor teamwork, logical thinking, and creativity, skills intimately articulated with the computing paradigm. The main objective of this work is to investigate the impact of ER activities on CT development and subjects learning in the Technical and Vocational Education in High School. For this, we accomplished a study of intervention research type with students and teachers analyzing quantitative and qualitative aspects. The results indicate that the introduction of ER can favor students in the development of CT skills and learning High School subjects.

AB  - This study investigates the efficacy of incorporating neuropedagogical elements into virtual simulators for advanced chemistry education in universities. Utilizing a mixed-method approach, it uses questionnaires completed by 50 organic chemistry students. These questionnaires included both general and Likert scale questions, focusing on students' experiences with the PhET Interactive Simulation. The results highlight the positive impact of neuropedagogy on students' learning attitudes, cognitive abilities, and skill development, particularly in areas like critical thinking, analytical skills, and social competencies. A significant portion of students reported enhanced educational outcomes: 76% observed improved training effectiveness, 88% better understood the subject, and 96% found the virtual simulator-based learning more engaging. Furthermore, the study notes improvements in students' problem-solving abilities (68%), logical reasoning (92%), and comprehension of chemical processes (94%). These findings emphasize the value of integrating neuroscience principles in chemical education, potentially benefiting both tertiary and secondary education sectors. They indicate the necessity for educational adaptation in line with interdisciplinary research in cognitive and neurological sciences. This research not only serves as a valuable resource for chemistry teachers but also sets the stage for future empirical studies exploring neuroscience's role in teacher education. The study underscores the importance of further investigation into how teachers implement neuropedagogical techniques and the effectiveness of such applications, advocating for continuous development in educational methodologies.

AB  - This paper addresses a particular aspect of 21st century skills: the potential of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) to support students in developing skills for citizenship, life and careers. In this respect, including connections to the world of work in mathematics and science classes seems to be indispensable. Therefore, in this paper we outline the necessity of including such connections in education and the related theoretical background. We then present an international research study of long-term professional development courses involving inquiry-based learning and connections to the world of work. The course was designed on an international level for use in 13 countries and was subsequently implemented in these countries. The results of the pre-post study across all these countries show that such a course can indeed lead to the desired outcomes concerning the teachers and their teaching, but also that these outcomes are associated with teachers' beliefs as well as their perceptions of policy support, classroom management and time issues.

AB  - As our understanding of complex environmental issues increases, institutions of higher education are evolving to develop new learning models that emphasize synthesis across disciplines, concepts, data, and methodologies. To this end, we argue for the implementation of environmental science education at the intersection of systems theory and service learning. A tight coupling of systems theory and service learning provides learners with the knowledge and skills required to tackle contemporary social-environmental challenges. The tangible benefits of a systems theory--service learning (STSL) curriculum occur in two principal learning areas: increased knowledge breadth and depth. Systems theory requires a broad assessment of social and environmental changes, whereas service learning promotes a brand of research and teaching resulting in a deepening of knowledge through field immersion. We present the tangible benefits of this deepening and broadening process along three axes: appreciation, research methods, and communication. (Contains 2 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - In this paper, I explore the need for particular types of interdisciplinarity, which I refer to as technical heteroglossia, in the face of neoliberal political and economic disenfranchisement. I examine the case of a group of medics (EMTs, nurses, and lay medical practitioners) known as street medics and their efforts to provide a working set of medical protocols for protesters, victims of natural disasters, and, more generally, communities resisting neoliberalism, militarism, and corporate power. To function, this network has had to explicitly embrace multiple medical traditions: allopathic (sometimes called Western), Chinese, herbalist, naturopathic, etc. Being able to speak within multiple traditions (medical heteroglossia) is deeply valued. I also recount the history of the medics and discuss at length the contextual forces that pull medics in different directions: allopathic medicine and more varied and unorthodox practices.

AB  - Educational neuroscience represents a concerted interdisciplinary effort to bring the fields of cognitive science, neuroscience and education to bear on classroom practice. This article draws attention to the current and potential implications of importing biological ideas, language and imagery into education. By analysing examples of brain-based consumer products and services, we express a concern that neuroscience discourse can promote reductive and deterministic ways of understanding the developing child, masking phenomenological, psychosocial, or cultural influences. Moreover, a lack of neuroscience literacy and the appeal of neuroscience explanations may leave this field especially vulnerable to misunderstanding and misappropriation. We conclude by suggesting some opportunities to mitigate these problems, thereby facilitating constructive interdisciplinary dialogue.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this article is to analyse the concepts of national and European identities through a multidisciplinary lens and to examine empirically how schools develop those identities in adolescents. Method: The study employs data from the "International Civic and Citizenship Education Study 2016." Correlation and regression analyses are conducted with data from over 45,000 students from fourteen different European educational systems. Country-specific weighted statistical analyses are conducted. Findings: A combination of perspectives from the fields of psychology, political culture, and civic and citizenship education is useful to reflect upon the dimensions and desirability of overarching identities. Formal learning opportunities are shown to be particularly relevant for fostering a European identity. Positive relationships between students and teachers and between students statistically predict stronger identities. Practical implications: Good social relationships at school help to develop national and European identities. Moreover, the development of a European identity especially depends upon its explicit inclusion in the curriculum. Teachers should guide students to reflect on the meaning and content of tolerant and complex national and European identities.

AB  - Cyberbiosecurity is an emerging field at the convergence of life sciences and the digital world. As technological advances improve operational processes and expose them to vulnerabilities in agriculture and life sciences, cyberbiosecurity has become increasingly important for addressing contemporary concerns. Unfortunately, at this time, educational opportunities for cyberbiosecurity workforce preparation are limited. Stakeholders' perceptions may help guide cyberbiosecurity workforce preparation efforts and bridge the gap from the classroom to the field. Toward this end, we identified stakeholders in education, private industry, and state agencies in Virginia and sought their input through both an online survey and focus groups. Findings suggest limited awareness and understanding of cyberbiosecurity. Results indicate that both formal and non-formal learning components--including short modules and comprehensive standalone courses--are important for cyberbiosecurity education programming. Stakeholders tied potential success of education programming to systems thinking and collaborative designs. Moreover, results reveal insights into concerns at the convergence of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT), which is central to effective workforce preparation for today's agriculture and life sciences professionals. Continuous interdisciplinary collaboration and academiaindustry partnerships will be critical for developing robust cyberbiosecurity education and securing the future of agriculture.

AB  - General Studies (Sachunterricht) lesson, which includes social and science themes because of its interdisciplinary form, takes place in the curriculum of each class level at primary schools in Germany. The aim of this descriptive case study is to examine how the teaching process of third-grade General Studies lesson is run in terms of learning place, teaching methods and techniques, and materials. The participants of it are six teachers of third grade from three different primary schools. The data were collected through classroom observations and interviews with teachers. While analysing the data, the content and the descriptive analysis methods were used. The results indicate that the teachers use classrooms, corridors, the workshop room, the schoolyards, trip fields and sport fields as learning spaces. Some of the teaching methods and techniques used are learning stations, project, class council, field trips, experiments, cooperative learning and teachers choose various teaching materials, depending on the theme.

AB  - The aim of this study is to construct a STEM competencies assessment framework and provide validity evidence by empirically testing its structure. Common interdisciplinary assessment frameworks for STEM seem to be scarce in the literature. Many studies use students' mathematics or science scores obtained from large-scale assessments or exams to assess STEM achievement. In the current framework, the multidimensional and integrated structure of the STEM competencies was addressed by taking into account science, technology, engineering, and mathematics domains. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics-related problems that required mathematical calculations were used as a medium to develop an assessment tool for this framework. A test was developed based on this assessment framework and items were calibrated using the item response theory. We tested the structure of the framework through confirmatory factor analysis by collecting data from 8th grade students. The empirical findings supported the structure of the STEM assessment framework.

AB  - The Science, Business and Policy Program (SBP) of the University of Groningen has been a work-based learning program for science master students since two decades. This program, a direct consequence of the Bologna declaration of education in Europe, has a distinctive position in European science curricula. Here, we use a web-based survey (N = 242), comparing alumni perceptions on the SBP program (N = 111) with a research oriented master (ROM, N = 131). Alumni from both programs predominantly had a content-driven motivation to choose for either the ROM or SBP format. For SBP alumni, this preference was also inspired by the master's focus on society and a career outside academia. We assessed self-perceived learning outcomes using an extended version of the Science Student Skills Inventory. Both groups were positive about the academic level of their program. Scientific content knowledge and practical research skills were perceived as sufficient by both groups, although significantly higher in the ROM group. Both groups were equally positive about obtained skills in academic reasoning and would have preferred more disciplinary content knowledge. The SBP group perceived their skills on teamwork, multidisciplinary working, leadership, ethical thinking and project work to be significantly higher compared to ROM alumni. The SBP group felt significantly more prepared for a career outside academia and the ROM group for a career in academia. Relatively the ROM group missed career preparation. Both specific work-based learning and classical research approaches were seen as valid ways to obtain a high-quality, science master level, although for different career ambitions.

AB  - A qualitative case study was conducted at six purposively sampled universities; out of a population of approximately 23 universities. This sampling strategy was based on selecting some universities that became Universities of Technology during the process of merging Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) while other universities kept their identity; currently being referred to as Traditional Universities. In-depth interviews and analysis of curriculum documents were used as sources of data acquisition to address the aim and questions explored by this study explored; necessitated by the need to implement Minimum Requirements for Teaching Education Qualification (MRTEQ) policy guidelines. The sampled universities' identities were concealed and pseudonyms were assigned to participants for ethical reasons. Qualitative methods were applied for data analysis. Findings revealed that for some institutions' integration of sub-disciples of science curriculum led to contestations and debates resulting from different philosophical perceptions held by subject specialists in the curriculum design process. Knowledge integration continues to be a contested field in universities that typifies resistance to change. Some participants demonstrated a positive disposition towards knowledge integration models which they used in curriculum development. This study concludes that a collaborative and collegial deliberation among science education lecturers and experts in various knowledge domains could be a way to find common ground on issues highlighted in this study. Re-thinking and re-conceptualising knowledge organisation for science academic knowledge are appropriate to the needs of school curriculum and benefit science teachers with knowledge and competences for knowledge impartation, skills and values in the subject.

AB  - Countries with well-trained and qualified labor force today make a significant difference with other countries in areas such as economy, education and industry. One of the important reasons for this difference is that these countries have made innovations in the fields of science, technology and education policies as well as economy. STEM, which is composed of the abbreviations of the first letters of the words Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, is an interdisciplinary approach. The aim of this study is to gather the experimental dissertations examining the effect of STEM education on students' academic achievements in order to determine the effect of STEM education on academic success and synthesize the study findings. The research was conducted in a screening model. In the study, as there is heterogeneity among the publications included among the scope of the meta-analysis, the size of the impact was calculated utilizing the random effects model. The dissertations examined within the scope of this study were accessed from the Higher Education Institution (HEI) National Study Search System databases using the keywords STEM, academic achievement and experimental model. In this study, dissertations were examined by taking a certain time criterion. A total of 26 dissertations (19 postgraduates and 7 doctoral) examining the effect of STEM education, which is the post-test scores of the experimental and control groups conducted in 2018-2020, on academic achievement were accessed from the database. It was concluded in the study that STEM education has a positive effect on the academic achievements of students.

AB  - In this research, an educational approach to the concept of energy is proposed. It is based on the history of physics. In 1854 Hermann Hemlholtz gave a popular lecture on the recent discovery that energy is conserved. Such lecture is used as a guide to introduce the pupils within several nuances of this concept. Not much mathematics is used, so Helmholtz's work, with several additions proposed here, is an excellent guide to understanding, from a qualitative point of view, the reasons that led scientists to establish the principle of conservation of energy. At the same time, it allows us to grasp two other concepts which are fundamental in reference to energy: work and heat. This panorama will be drawn in the first section. In the second one, some more mathematical and physical details on the teaching of energy in mechanics and thermodynamics will be offered. Finally, in the Conclusion, the interdisciplinary value of a historical approach to physics education will be pointed out. [For the full proceedings, see ED629086.]

AB  - Project RESET engaged resettled Chin refugee teens in critical STEM literacy practices in a community-based afterschool STEM enrichment program in the United States. Over the course of nine months, the participants multimodally and multilinguistically communicated their learning about weather, climate, and climate change, while also developing English proficiency. In this paper, we define critical STEM literacy drawing on current scholarship on critical science literacy and interdisciplinary STEM learning. We then present our four design principles of the learning environment for supporting critical STEM literacy and English learning and share examples from the program that demonstrate how the principles were enacted to engage youth. Drawing on our learning in this work, we will discuss implications for science educators who work with displaced or resettled youth in Asia and the Pacific regions that provide new homes for many displaced children and teens.

AB  - Many mathematics educators are not aware of a strong connection that exists between the education of computer programming and mathematics. The reason may be that they have not been exposed to computer programming. This connection is worth exploring, given the current trends of automation and Industry 4.0. Therefore, in this paper we take a closer look at the Common Core's eight Mathematical Practice Standards. We show how each one of them can be reinforced through computer programming. The following discussion is virtually independent of the choice of a concrete programming language. Therefore, in the interest of simplicity, we will use a well-known educational programming language named Karel the Robot based on (Pattis, 1995) which is freely available online in NCLab (NCLab, 2019). The visual character of this language will allow us to provide more illustrative examples than would be possible with a standard programming language such as Java, C++ or Python.

AB  - Career development of Science students seems dependent on more than disciplinary education, such as the nature and focus of career preparation. In this study we compare graduate outcomes of science students at the University of Groningen, completing two master-level program streams with different focal points, by using career progress surveys from alumni (n=242) with self-reported societal development data. The first program is a classical research-oriented master (ROM), that aims to prepare students for a career within academia. The second program, called Science, Business and Policy (SBP) focusses on a societal profile and aims to prepare for a career outside academia. SBP is different from ROM because it has a practical and multidisciplinary orientation (vs a theoretical and mono-disciplinary orientation in ROM) and it includes a long work-placement outside academia, a form of work based learning. The differences in the tracks translate to differences in career paths. Both profiles resulted in good but distinct career opportunities, corresponding to alumni's discipline and sector. Although ROM-alumni felt especially prepared for an academic career, only a quarter actually continued in academia and many we employed in education. In contrast, most SBP-alumni were employed in business or policy. Targeting specific job preparation seems more successful with a societal profile. Reflecting on skills, in both groups research-related skills decreased during careers while soft skills increased. Alumni were generally satisfied with their first job and also with their current job, with SBP-alumni scoring significantly higher on satisfaction with income, status, appreciation and perspective. It can be concluded that diversification in educational profiles changes the societal career paths of science students. [Note: The page range (119-121) and (104-135) shown on the PDF is incorrect.

AB  - Background: Nanotechnology, a multidisciplinary field with increasing societal importance, demands for an increase in research abilities and capacities. Yet, nanoscience and nanotechnology (NST) are largely inaccessible to K-12 students. This situation demands efforts in research towards bringing NST learning into K-12 classrooms. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the outcomes of an application-based nanotechnology module, developed for late middle school students. The study focused on exploring student readiness to unpack unfamiliar NST concepts, and the effects engagement with NST had on student attitudes towards STEM subjects. Purpose: Participants included a total of three science teachers and 169, grade 8 and 9 students from two public school districts from a northeastern state of the USA over two years. Data was collected and used from students who consented for the study. Design and Methods: The NST learning module was developed in three phases, beginning with an introductory session to discuss module content and design. We then designed a module for implementation. Drawing from results from the pilot module and teacher inputs, we revised the pilot module for this study. Surveys, content questionnaires, student reflections, and classroom videos were collected for analysis. Results: Students demonstrated conceptual understanding of the working of the AFM after working closely with the tool. Our data highlights students' readiness to unpack unfamiliar NST concepts. Despite no significant changes, we noticed increases in students' attitudes towards STEM subjects and careers, and an increase in the number of students who plan to take advanced STEM courses. Conclusion: Based on our results, we suggest the use of technology-based experiences to introduce novel ideas of NST as early as eighth grade. The technology-based approach created a new space for contextualized learning. Working with teachers is critical to creating new teaching-learning experiences for K-12 learning, especially in the context of NST.
