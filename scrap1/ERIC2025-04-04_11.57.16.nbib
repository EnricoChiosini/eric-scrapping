AB  - Over the past forty years, Howard Barrows' contributions to PBL research have influenced and guided educational research and practice in a diversity of domains. It is necessary to make visible to all PBL scholars what has been accomplished, what is perceived as significant, and what is the scope of applicability for Barrows' groundbreaking findings. As more disciplines recognize Barrows' efforts and adopt PBL in education, it becomes crucial but challenging to sustain community memory so that PBL scholars are kept well informed of research innovations in various domains. In this paper, we review Barrows' scholarly efforts in PBL and reveal the impacts on subsequent studies in various domains. A bibliometrics analysis is conducted on Barrows' PBL publications and the corresponding citations to quantitatively measure Barrows' impact. Our findings demonstrate Barrows' exceptional contributions to PBL and the disciplinary differences in conducting PBL studies based on Barrows' work. It is also revealed that PBL scholars who share similar interests have rarely collaborated with each other. The PBL research community has a real opportunity to connect isolated research groups and reduce the fragmentation so that research innovations in one domain can be disseminated to inform other scholars.

AB  - Implementing inquiry in the outdoors introduces many challenges for teachers, some of which can be dealt with using mobile technologies. For productive use of these technologies, teachers should be provided with the opportunity to develop relevant knowledge and practices. In a professional development (PD) program in this design-based research, 24 teachers were involved in adaptation of a learning environment supporting inquiry in the outdoors that included the use of mobile technologies. They first experienced the learning environment as learners, then adapted it for their own use, and finally, enacted the adapted environment with peers. We examined the scope and character of teacher involvement in adaptation, and the consequent professional growth, by analyzing observations, questionnaires, interviews and the adapted learning-environments. Findings indicate that all teachers demonstrated change processes, including changes in knowledge and practice, but the coherence of the learning environments decreased when substantial adaptations were made. Some teachers demonstrated professional growth, as reflected by their implementation of ideas learned in the PD program in their daily practice, long after the PD program had ended. This study demonstrates how the Teachers as Designers approach can support teacher learning and illustrates productive use of scaffolds for teacher growth and professional development.

AB  - E-learning experiences are widely becoming common practice in many schools, tertiary institutions and other organisations. However despite this increased use of technology to enhance learning and the associated investment involved the result does not always equate to more engaged, knowledgeable and skilled learners. We have observed two key prevalences. The first is an ingrained, and often unquestioned, set of beliefs and expectations held by the majority of people who have experienced formal education, and who are involved in the development of eLearning and blended learning experiences. These beliefs tend to impact the overall design of what a blended type of learning experience might consist of. The second prevalence is for educational institutions to embark on large-scale eLearning developments, which by their scale can prove problematic. In part because it is a long time before the school or organisation sees any benefit and there is an up-front cost before any learning value is realised. In this paper we will be discussing our experiences of the implementation of a large-scale blended-learning project at Unitec, a tertiary institution in Aotearoa, New Zealand. Approaches taken to implement the development were iterative and based on a phased rollout, with each subsequent stage being informed by the ones before it. Our discussion draws on personal reflections associated with three different perspectives and a variety of roles during the three initial phases of the change making process. Our overall aim is to share our contextualised experiences, to add to the knowledge base on blended learning, and to provide some general, practical recommendations.

AB  - Learning communities (LCs) offer high-impact practices of active learning and practical application, but such practices demand devoted class time and room for reflection. Core science courses that serve as prerequisites for more advanced courses have specific and fixed content that offers no space in which to incorporate the ideals of LCs. Wagner College's three-course model for first-year LCs solves this conundrum by providing a Reflective Tutorial (RFT)--a course dedicated to critical thinking, frequent writing, reflection, and practical application through experiential learning--that bridges two content courses based on a well-developed theme. This structure allows any course appropriate for first-year students, including core science courses, to be incorporated in an LC. Two faculty members work as a team to create the three-course LC; each faculty member teaches one of the content courses to the same group of 24-28 students. The two instructors team teach the RFT or offer independent small sections of the RFT; the RFT replaces the traditional first-year writing course. Specific examples are provided of LCs incorporating a core science course.

AB  - Socioscientific Inquiry (SSI) represents one approach designed to target interest and knowledge in science. In this context, students consider scientific issues that have social implications and require a range of trade-offs, concepts, and considerations in order to arrive at informed conclusions (Sadler, 2004). However, inquiry tasks in general and SSI projects in particular are not widely adopted in K-12 settings, despite strong beliefs among teachers that these types of activities are valuable (Marshall, Horton, Igo, & Switzer, 2009). We suggest Collaborative Action Research may provide an important platform for enabling teachers to experience success through systematic investigations of their practice supported by peer interaction and collaboration (Capobianco & Feldman, 2006). In our investigation, we sought to understand the learning experiences of teachers within redesigned graduate-level courses aimed at preparing teachers to implement SSI approaches in the classroom. Data were collected from course participants to capture changes in scientific content knowledge, perceptions of SSI instruction, and strengths as well as recommendations of the experience. Results suggest that teachers can gain both content knowledge and pedagogical capacity in SSI methods.

AB  - In recent years, schools (as well as universities) have added cyber security to their computer science curricula. This topic is still new for most of the current teachers, who would normally have a standard computer science background. Therefore the teachers are trained and then teaching their students what they have just learned. In order to explore differences in both populations' learning, we compared measures of software quality and security between high-school teachers and students. We collected 109 source files, written in Python by 18 teachers and 31 students, and engineered 32 features, based on common standards for software quality (PEP 8) and security (derived from CERT Secure Coding Standards). We use a multi-view, data-driven approach, by (a) using hierarchical clustering to bottom-up partition the population into groups based on their code-related features and (b) building a decision tree model that predicts whether a student or a teacher wrote a given code (resulting with a LOOCV kappa of 0.751). Overall, our findings suggest that the teachers' codes have a better quality than the students'--with a sub-group of the teachers, mostly males, demonstrate better coding than their peers and the students--and that the students' codes are slightly better secured than the teachers' codes (although both populations show very low security levels). The findings imply that teachers might benefit from their prior knowledge and experience, but also emphasize the lack of continuous involvement of some of the teachers with code-writing. Therefore, findings shed light on computer science teachers as life-long learners. Findings also highlight the difference between quality and security in today's programming paradigms. Implications for these findings are discussed.

AB  - New educational standards implementation prioritizes the projective beginning of training in school education. Therefore, consideration of educational activity only as the process of obtaining ready knowledge should be abandoned. Thus the relevance of the studied problem is substantiated by the need to develop methodical works connected with the introduction of inter-subject projects into mathematics teachers' pedagogical activity as mathematics has a wide application in various sciences, though, at lessons, it is left behind due to time limits and insufficient mathematical apparatus school students possess. All that said specifies the goal of the paper: to define opportunities of project-based activity application in integration of mathematical and natural-science disciplines and development of methodical recommendations on its broad application in the course of training in the subject. The key research method of this problem is modeling the system of possible project-based activity directions aimed to work purposefully to increase results in subject studied as well as to develop meta-subject abilities. The paper proves the necessity to apply project-based technology in the form of inter-subject projects on mathematics; the basic models of school disciplines integration in the context of project-based learning opportunities realization are revealed; project themes of integrated disciplines that differ in time periods, volume and quantity are elaborated; features of their use in the course of studying mathematics are identified. Practical application of this system compensates the lack of tools of meta-subject technologies in pedagogical activity as it demands the ability to work in team, communicative skills, tolerance, self-organization, abilities to set goals independently, to achieve them and to analyze obtained results.

AB  - In this paper, we examine a first-year torque and angular acceleration problem to address a possible use of the forelimbs of "Tyrannosaurus rex." A 1/40th-scale model (see Fig. 1) is brought to the classroom to introduce the students to the quandary: given that the forelimbs of "T. rex" were too short to reach its mouth, what function did the forelimbs serve? This issue crosses several scientific disciplines including paleontology, ecology, and physics, making it a great starting point for thinking "outside the box." Noted paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter has suggested that the forelimbs of "T. rex" were an integral part of its predatory behavior. Given the large teeth of "T. rex," it is assumed that they killed with their teeth. Lipkin and Carpenter have suggested that the forelimbs were used to hold a struggling victim (which had not been dispatched with the first bite) while the final, lethal bite was applied. If that is the case, then the forelimbs must be capable of large angular accelerations a in order to grab the animal attempting to escape. The concepts of the typical first-year physics course are sufficient to test this hypothesis by solving a = t/I. Naturally, students love solving any problem related to "Tyrannosaurus rex"!

AB  - Changes in the economy, nature, production and society together with increasing scientific and technological knowledge make demands of transforming school teaching in the field of technology education. This article analyses current trends in Finnish technology education. The aim of the article is to explore briefly the integration between Science and Craft education and some of the current practices in technology education in Finland. Finnish technology education can be characterized as a design approach that has evolved from the craft-oriented tradition. Additionally, it involves many elements of computer controlling and electronic principles, but still much of the learning is focused on production skills. Approaches that are now dominant in craft education do not prepare students to meet the challenges of modern technology and working life.

AB  - In this article, Tammy D. Lee and Jane L. Lubischer describe a classroom lesson designed to explore how animals use sound to communicate and how this communication affects their survival. Lee and Lubischer wanted to bring an awareness of how science is happening in students' own backyards. They developed a half-day 5E lesson integrating two of the disciplinary core ideas from the "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS)": physical science (Wave Properties, grade 1) (PS4.A) and (Social Interactions and Group Behavior, grade 3) life science (LS2.D). They integrated these two disciplinary core ideas to demonstrate how science disciplines work together within the natural world. The first-grade disciplinary core idea (PS4.A) of how sound is created and travels was chosen to establish this physical science conceptual foundation for the first-grade students as well as to assess the prior knowledge of the third-grade students in terms of sound creation. With this foundation established, they then wanted to extend the concept of sound creation of vibrating human-made materials to how animals create sounds using vibrating materials within their bodies. Finally, Lee and Lubischer wanted to build upon this physical science concept of creation of sound to understanding the purpose of this creation of sound (LS2.D). In the real world, science disciplines do not exist in isolation (NRC 2012). The integration of science concepts was demonstrated by exploring how animals use sound to communicate messages (life science), with students using vibrating materials (physical science) to mimic these animal calls (sounds). Using the theme of sound, students asked questions (Connections to Nature of Science) about how frogs make sounds and how they use sounds to communicate. Students also had an opportunity to plan and carry out an investigation (Science and Engineering Practices) in a non-laboratory environment, just as many scientists (e.g., Earth scientists, ethologists, ecologists) collect data within a natural setting. Finally, within this lesson, students used evidence to construct an argument based on their own interpretation of collected data. This was done through a game that explored whether frogs benefit from living in a community by exploring how frog calls help frogs locate mates.

AB  - The School for Science and Math at Vanderbilt (SSMV) is an innovative partnership program between a Research I private university and a large urban public school system. The SSMV was started in 2007 and currently has 101 students enrolled in the program, with a total of 60 students who have completed the 4-yr sequential program. Students attend the SSMV for one full day per week during the school year and 3-6 wk in the summers following their ninth-to 11th-grade years, with each grade of 26 students coming to the Vanderbilt campus on a separate day. The research-based curriculum focuses on guiding students through the process of learning to develop questions and hypotheses, designing projects and performing analyses, and communicating results of these projects. The SSMV program has elevated the learning outcomes of students as evidenced by increased achievement scores relative to a comparison group of students; has provided a rigorous research-based science, technology, engineering, and mathematics elective curriculum that culminates in a Summer research internship; has produced 27 Intel and Siemens semifinalists and regional finalists over the past 4 yr; and has supported the development of writing and communication skills resulting in regional and national oral presentations and publications in scientific journals.

AB  - In this paper, the authors describe how two institutions are helping their undergraduate biology students build quantitative competencies. Incorporation of quantitative skills and reasoning in biology are framed through a discussion of two cases that both concern introductory biology courses, but differ in the complexity of the mathematics and the type of changes involved. First, at the University of Maryland-College Park, MathBench Biology Modules (via an interactive Web-based instructional service) are providing supplemental materials to illustrate and develop quantitative competencies basic to biology. The second example, at Davidson College, uses a unique text to introduce a wide range of students, including those with no calculus experience, to challenging mathematical concepts in biology. The textbook emphasizes learning through modeling and data analysis, activities that are integral to developing understanding in biology. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Flow synthesis in microfluidic devices has been rapidly adapted in the pharmaceutical industry and in many research laboratories. Yet, the cost of commercial flow reactors is a major factor limiting the dissemination of this technology in the undergraduate curriculum. Here, we present a laboratory activity where students design and fabricate homemade microfluidic flow reactors using thermoplastic molds and soft lithographic methods, and conduct inorganic syntheses of magnetite particles and gold-citrate nanoparticles, as well as a two-step organic synthesis of azo dyes. The success of these reactions can be quickly assessed by colors or physical characteristics, which makes optimizations of reactor designs and reaction conditions possible on-the-spot. The activity also successfully integrates some important concepts in chemical engineering, organic and inorganic synthesis, nanomaterial chemistry, and analytical chemistry.

AB  - This study explored and documented students' responses to opportunities for collective knowledge building and collaboration in a problem-solving process within complex environmental challenges and pressing issues with various dimensions of knowledge and skills. Middle-school students ("n" =?16; age 14) and high-school students ("n"?=?16; age 17) from two Singapore public institutions participated in an environmental science field study to experience knowledge integration and a decision-making process. Students worked on six research topics to understand the characteristics of an organic farm and plan for building an ecological village. Students collected and analysed data from the field and shared their findings. Their field work and discussions were video-recorded, and their reflective notes and final reports were collected for data coding and interpretation. The results revealed that throughout the study, students experienced the needs and development of integrated knowledge, encountered the challenges of knowledge sharing and communication during their collaboration, and learned how to cope with the difficulties. Based on research findings, this study further discusses students' learning through a collaborative problem-solving process, including the interdependence of knowledge and the development of mutual relationships such as respect and care for others' knowledge and learning.

AB  - In this design case, we present an instructional design project that resulted in a French language learning game development system. What we describe here is not the game itself, but rather the pedagogical intervention that created what the design team termed a mobile "application farm," which in turn produced the game. The term "farm" was used due to the perspective of the designers to create a sustainable system rather than a single design. This design case also has another purpose beyond presenting precedent in instructional design; we interrogate the interview process and the protocol we used while documenting this project. We present the outcome of our interrogation in reflection notes posted throughout this design case. We do this because we believe that there is a value and need for design cases created by someone outside of the design arena but with access to members of the design team, in order to elicit where precedents might be found within complex designs.

AB  - The disciplines of anatomy and surgery are not dichotomous since one is dependent on the other. Traditionally, surgeons predominantly taught gross and clinical anatomy. In this review, we examine the context of how human anatomy is taught nowadays. In essence, we discovered that there are certain discernable trends consistently observable between the American and British systems. In Singapore, the British Russell Group first influenced its education landscape but now more so by the American Ivy League. Singapore now has three medical schools all offering differing anatomy curricula, which serves as an opportune time for it to consider if there is a best approach given that the practice of surgery is also evolving in parallel. This review discusses the various pedagogies and issues involved, and will serve as a forum and stimulus for discussion. By tweaking the curriculum correctly and the lessons learnt, future doctors and surgeons in training will receive a better anatomical education, not just in Singapore but the world in general. Key recommendations include the use of body painting, clay, plasticine to facilitate the learning of anatomy, and the implementation of a body donation program. Furthermore, strategic mergers with key stakeholders will also ensure the survival of the discipline.

AB  - The digital revolution is upon us, bringing with it disruptive forces in every aspect of business and personal interactions. The business marketing function has become so technologically driven it is sometimes hard to tell where the boundaries between the Marketing and Information Systems disciplines lie. The new world of digital marketing has changed how both marketing and technology professionals approach their jobs. Digital has created new roles, and much of what we knew and taught in higher education is no longer viable. New hybrid education programs are required to equip the new generation of workers with the skills they need to be successful. While marketing and information systems and technology education programs will undoubtedly continue to exist as separate entities, there are opportunities for cross pollination between the two disciplines. Just as corporate enterprises will need to embrace this new way of doing business if they are to be successful, so too will academic enterprises need to incorporate new methods and new ideas into their offerings if they are to remain competitive with their peer institutions. This paper explores the concept of how this new digital world has transformed the marketing function, the impact it has on the consumerization of information technology, and how higher education will have to respond. Digital has arrived, and it is here to stay.

AB  - Experimental science activities in primary school enable important cross-curricular learning. In this study, experimental activities on microbiology were carried out by 16 pupils in a Portuguese grade-4 classroom (9-10?years old) and were focused on two problem-questions related to microbiology and health: (1) do your teeth carry microbes? (2) why should you brush your teeth after meals? To solve problem-question (1), children's samples of dental plaque were prepared and observed under the microscope. For question (2), culture medium plates were inoculated with children's dental plaque either before or after tooth brushing and the colonies were counted. Results showed that pupils easily recognised the presence of microorganisms in the mouth and verified the effectiveness of the process of teeth-brushing. Pupils understood that microorganisms were potentially responsible for the onset of dental caries. These practical activities on microbiology in primary school were very effective in ensuring young children easily understand the causes of dental caries and how they can be prevented. Pupils became aware that the act of brushing their teeth is not only a socially correct behaviour or a simple rule to meet, but also a matter of preventing illness and promoting health.

AB  - In a world which abounds with digitally-driven changes, an orthodoxy of technology adoption and utilisation in higher education is emerging, and it is deemed critical for steering the discussions of experts for planning and implementing a digitally-enabled ecology where students and faculty members alike will benefit. Although several types of software that host educational or training content for students have been used in previous studies, the aim of this EU-funded project was to design a digitally-enabled platform that would afford culturally-driven exchanges between university students and collaboration among faculty members of the same disciplines across Europe. The platform is based on, but extends beyond, principles of standard Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and Facebook, by affording Web 2.0 tools, Augmented Reality (AR) applications, and QR codes. Further, the platform has been designed based on multiple pilot testing phases, students' individual needs, instructors' constructive feedback, and the tailored needs of each academic discipline. This EU-funded project is a joint effort to guide instructors and students in experiencing the curricula in different academic institutions, to guide instructors and students in understanding the affordances and contradictions of intercultural telecollaboration, and to guide students in developing a conceptual understanding of complex constructs in their discipline.

AB  - The need for a convergence of the visual arts and the natural sciences within the framework of both formal (schools, universities) and non-formal education (museum) at the level of dissemination and popularization of this knowledge is something that has preoccupied the communities of artists, scientists and educators. In the present work we aim to present in a concise way certain positions with regard to the historical, philosophical and didactical dimensions of the problem of popularizing and teaching the relation between the visual arts and the natural sciences. More precisely, we intend to show the existence of this relation throughout history and within the society by reference to certain typical examples of how scientific ideas about nature and the propagation of light influenced the practices of the neo-impressionists or the early abstract painters in relation to the use of colour or the way the visual arts aid in the representation of scientific objects and/or ideas. At the epistemological level, we are going to put forth Levy-Leblond's idea that the relation between the visual arts and the natural sciences is a relation of meeting, controversy or even conflict but definitely not a relation of confusion or fusion. Furthermore, at the didactical level we aim to present the popularization and the teaching of the relation between the visual arts and the natural sciences as a problem of the didactic transformation of knowledge and reference practices and not as a clearly pedagogical construct.

AB  - Cases of unethical business practices and technical failures have been extensively reported. It seems that actions are often taken by individuals with little apparent concern for those affected by their negative outcomes, which can be described as moral disengagement. This study investigates levels of moral disengagement demonstrated by business and science undergraduate students. Results indicate higher levels of moral disengagement in men than in women, but few significant differences between students majoring in business and those majoring in science.

AB  - The purposes of this study were to develop instruments that assess public knowledge of nanotechnology (PKNT), public attitudes toward nanotechnology (PANT) and conduct a pilot study for exploring the relationship between PKNT and PANT. The PKNT test was composed of six scales involving major nanotechnology concepts, including size and scale, structure of matter, size-dependent properties, forces and interactions, tools and instrumentation, as well as science, technology, and society. After item analysis, 26 multiple-choice questions were selected for the PKNT test with a KR-20 reliability of 0.91. Twenty items were developed in the PANT questionnaire which can be classified as scales of trust in government and industry, trust in scientists, and perception of benefit and risk. Cronbach alpha for the PANT questionnaire was 0.70. In a pilot study, 209 citizens, varying in age, were selected to respond to the instruments. Results indicated that about 70% of respondents did not understand most of the six major concepts involving nanotechnology. The public tended to distrust government and industry and their levels of trust showed no relationship to their levels of knowledge about nanotechnology. However, people perceived that nanotechnology provided high benefits and high risks. Their perceptions of the benefits and risks were positively related with their knowledge level of nanotechnology. People's trust showed a negative relationship to their risk perception. Implications for using these instruments in research are discussed in this paper.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of Summer Environmental Education Program (SEEP) on elementary school students' environmental knowledge, affect, skills and behavior which are the main components of environmental literacy. The sample consisted of 45 students (25 males, 20 females) studying in 4th through 8th grades and living in Orphanage in Antalya. Various data collection instruments (e.g. Environmental Knowledge Test, Affective Disposition toward Environment Scale, Children's Responsible Environmental Behavior Scale and Scientific Process Skill for the Environmental Test) were used for assessing students' different outcomes prior to and after SEEP. The open-ended responses were subjected to content analysis whilst the remaining data were subjected to statistical analysis (e.g. repeated t-test). The results revealed that students' environmental knowledge, environmental sensitivity, intention, environmental attitudes and responsible environmental behaviors significantly increased after intervention. Even though students' "cognitive skills" and "saving behavior" increased from pre-test to post-test, these increases were not statistically significant.

AB  - This paper is part of a larger study that aims at highlighting students' interpretations of the idea of the "Balance of Nature", as well as its use in their reasoning about the future of an ecosystem, in order to subsequently develop a learning environment that might promote a reconsideration of its validity and usefulness. Our focus here is particularly set on whether and how non biology-major students use this idea when making predictions about (a) the future of an ecosystem that is supposed to have suffered a human-driven disturbance, and (b) the future of an ecosystem that is supposed to be protected against such disturbances. Administering a questionnaire of 12 items--4 of which concern us here--to 61 1st-year educational sciences students at the University of Patras, we traced--among others--their reasoning about (a) the future of three ecosystems (forest, sea, lake), supposed to have suffered different human-driven disturbances (fire, oil spill, new population introduction), and (b) the future of a protected forest ecosystem of a national park. According to our findings, most of the students found it very likely for a disturbed ecosystem to fully recover its initial state--mainly due to a "recovery process" or inherent "recovery mechanisms"--showing a strong belief in an extremely resilient "Balance of Nature". Moreover, most of them appeared to believe that if human-protected, an ecosystem will be in a continuous "balance", while very few were skeptical enough to claim a non-predictable future for it.

AB  - Science and mathematics education needs to serve several (possibly contradictory) motivating goals. One is found in the movement for a universal literacy in the central principles and methods of the disciplines. The second is the need to provide the experiences and background that makes possible the production of scientists and engineers. A complication in both efforts is that the formal education takes place over many years, and the application of the layers of information, understanding, and sophistication need also be aware of the age of the student and what has come before. These efforts require clear ideas as to the end goal of the process and attention to assessment. Receiving less attention is the need to also feed and nurture the creative side of those who would become professionals, as creative approaches will be a central and necessary aspect of their work and thought. In this paper, I address the use of a course in mathematical modeling taught over a period of 25 years to undergraduate students of mathematics, mathematics education, computer science, and engineering, as a method to open up creative pathways. Through an historical discussion of the role and nature of creativity in the sciences and mathematics, a process to have students find their creative voice is described in the context of this course.

AB  - Nanotechnology is an emerging science that involved in different fields. This research inquired elementary school students' learning effect by using quasi-experiment, expositive-teaching and experiential-teaching methods for nanotechnology in the microcosmic world. By utilized the pretest "Nanotechnology Situational Questionnaire (NSQ)", we have selected 110 fifth grade students with similar academic performance in nanotechnology knowledge from Northern Taiwan. This research designed 2 teaching steps. The first step had 4 class sessions, and then implemented the expositive-teaching to all the students. The main learning context was related to understand nanometer definitions, characters and fundamental concepts. The second step divided 110 students into treatment and comparison groups, each group had 3 class sessions. The treatment group implemented experiential-teaching, on the other hand, the comparison group implemented expositive-teaching by PowerPoints, animations and movies. After the experiment, the 2 groups completed posttest NSQ. The results showed: 1. Two groups were no difference in posttest NSQ score after the first step teaching, but after the second step teaching, the treatment group had significant higher scores than comparison group. It meant that experiential-teaching method was more effective than the expositive-teaching. 2. In expositive-teaching: (a) Used actual objects, students held more complete concepts and had significant learning effect. (b) The simulated model teaching facilitates learning, but students somewhat still had vague concepts. (c) Applied a simulated model to explain another simulated model, students can hardly understood difficult concept, so they still had misconceptions. Therefore, before teaching, teacher must considering cognitive development and selecting teaching methods carefully. For extensive nanotechnology education and foster talents, educators must adopting nanotechnology into formal elementary curriculum and designing a series of complete teaching plan.

AB  - Current opinion holds that school science has not been producing the expected outcomes. Highlighted by a considerable body of research, one of the concerns is that young people still mobilize a naive conception of science. Consequently, we must pursue the reflection process concerning ways of renewing the school conception of science so as to propose ways of representing and doing that are a greater source of participation among students. In this article, we argue for the importance of enriching school discourses by mobilizing a socialized conception of science. Our perspective seeks to highlight the major theoretical contributions of ethnomethodology put forward by Bruno Latour. Hence, we propose an operational definition of the social construction of science based on actor-network theory as an attempt to produce a more focused conceptualization of science as a social enterprise. This theoretical work enables us to bring out various facets of the social construction of science that, in our view, should be accounted for in classes to renew the school image of science in line with the characteristics of contemporary technosciences "in the making." Finally, we illustrate how we can mobilize this understanding of science for secondary students. (Contains 5 footnotes.)

AB  - Some of the most important scientific studies are associated with either incredibly large dimensions (e.g., the universe) or extremely small proportions (e.g., the cell). While a teacher's curriculum may often switch from mega-expanses to minutia, they should question how easily students comprehend the change in sizes. This article addresses the crosscutting concept of scale, focusing on microscopic science. Microorganisms and pollen, either modern or fossilized, offer students a glimpse into a hidden "micro world." Pollens and microfossils are abundant, readily providing opportunities for student-led inquiry to address concepts in botany, ecology, fossilization, evolution, and environmental change. The article discusses how the study of microfossils and pollen can be used to focus upon concepts in biology, geology, chemistry, mathematics, economics, art, history, and more. The authors assert that MicroWorld inquiry units such as the one described herein can incorporate reconstruction of ancient environments, solve "mysteries" of crime scenes, and address current issues such as climate change. Perhaps most importantly, microfossils and pollen can address the crosscutting concept of scale from the microscopic viewpoint.

AB  - Teacher-made teaching and learning resources are an effective way to facilitate relevant and appropriate curriculum content, values and attitudes for students. This is particularly significant when the context is rather unique, as was the case in the remote developing Pacific Island Country of Nauru. Such resources can be deployed in accompaniment with carefully selected commercially available resources. This approach has been shown to be particularly effective when integrating literacy and other disciplines such as Science. This study demonstrates the relevance; benefits and practicality of having teachers create their own storybooks for use in communicating chosen science concepts in a way that develops science knowledge and understanding as well as reading development and other literacy skills.

AB  - In this paper, we recommend mathematical teaching through dual treatments. The dual treatments notion, classified in dual interpretations, dual analyses, dual solutions, and dual formulations, is explained through concrete examples taken from mathematical textbooks of elementary education. Dual treatments provide opportunities for creating different points of view on a mathematical situation and thus developing the integrative perceptions of the students. Teaching through dual treatments for integrative perceptions formation was evaluated during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 academic school year periods. Data were evaluated using ANOVA and t test analyses. The study, involving 205 students in the first grade of the elementary education, demonstrated that mathematical teaching through dual treatments (1) influences the integrative perceptions formation; (2) there is no significant difference between girls and boys after the implementation of teaching through dual treatments in integrative perceptions formation.

AB  - Conferences addressing emerging commonalities in the information professions were being held as far back as the early 1980s. At that time, there appeared to be two differing thoughts on the future of the information professions: one that saw the increasing diversification, the other favouring the professions' convergence. Nearly thirty-five years later, we are still discussing the various advantages and disadvantages that a convergence of the information professions and professionals may bring; yet there has been very little empirical evidence gathered to enable us to move forward in this discussion. This conceptual paper uses existing literature to argue that the convergence of galleries, libraries, archives and museums is not a new concept to these institutions, but that they have been linked--philosophically and intellectually at least--for millennia. The intention of this paper is not to articulate what should be included in a GLAM curriculum, or to identify the skills and knowledge required of an information professional in a converged environment, but rather to demonstrate that this research is needed in order to provide an evidence base from which these may be developed.

AB  - The research reported in this paper explores the applicability and efficacy of a variant of problem-based learning, the Preparation for Future Learning (PFL) approach, to teaching and learning within the context of a cross-curricular, middle school data literacy unit called "Thinking with Data" (TWD). A quasi-experimental design was used to compare pre-to-post-test data literacy gains of seventh grade students participating in the TWD unit with other seventh graders in two middle schools in northeast Ohio. Results show statistically significant differences between the two groups. Taken together with participant comments, the findings suggest that the PFL approach can be effectively implemented across subject areas to support the development of data literacy.

AB  - In 2012, the United Nations General Assembly declared 2014 the International Year of Crystallography. Throughout the year 2014 and beyond, all the crystallographic associations and societies active all over the world are organizing events to attract the wider public toward crystallography and the numerous topics to which it is deeply interlinked. To increase awareness of modern crystallography and to diminish its halo of exoticism, the present commentary focuses on the fundamental contributions of X-ray crystallography during the last century in chemistry, physics, and medicine, as witnessed by the numerous Nobel Prizes that involved it.

AB  - Problem-based learning (PBL) is a constructivist method of instruction aligned with the science educational reform movement to increase scientific literacy for all Americans. As such, PBL instruction is an increasingly popular topic for professional development workshops offered to teachers in secondary learning environments. This research presents a case study of four teachers' alignment of classroom practice with constructivist principles after participating in a one-week PBL workshop. Teachers assimilated PBL instruction into their current system of teaching; therefore, despite congruent beliefs, those teachers without a constructivist system of practice taught the PBL method with less alignment to constructivist principles. This discrepancy between beliefs and practice could be addressed by helping PBL workshop participants contemplate how components of PBL encourage reform-based constructivist practices and by assisting teachers with modifying preexisting routines to better assimilate PBL instruction.

AB  - This paper utilizes Bourdieu's conceptual frame to examine the mediatized effects of policy processes concerned with the growth and support of knowledge industries in Australia. These policies span education, science, research and other knowledge industries (such as venture capital firms and intellectual property law). The paper argues that some policy processes are best represented as temporary social fields. The nature of these fields can be described by the kinds of cross-field effects that they produce. A case study of an Australian knowledge economy policy, "The chance to change", and associated policy processes demonstrates the broad analytic capacities of Bourdieu's conceptual frame for policy analysis, when combined with the concepts of cross-field effects and temporary social field developed here.

AB  - A challenge for new residents and senior residents preparing for board examinations is refreshing their knowledge of basic science disciplines, such as human gross anatomy. The Department of Orthopaedics at the University of Utah School of Medicine has for many years held an annual Orthopedic Resident Anatomy Review Course during the summer months for all of its residents. The primary purpose of the course is to renew competencies in basic science disciplines so that incoming residents more quickly reach a level of functional proficiency and to afford senior residents a platform to teach their junior colleagues. Before 2005, this course was conducted with minimal participation from anyone outside of the Department of Orthopaedics. Many of the residents voiced concerns that the educational benefits were not proportionate to the time invested. To improve the teaching of orthopedic-related anatomy, an educational collaboration between the Departments of Neurobiology and Anatomy and Orthopaedics was established in 2004 and continues to the present time. The major objectives of refining the course pedagogy, developing a "Course Manual and Dissection Guide," and evaluating the results by administering a course survey questionnaire are described in this article. Implementation of all facets of the revised course has resulted in better participation by orthopedic faculty and more favorable reviews by the participating residents. Based on current levels of interest and positive comments from course participants, the Anatomy and Orthopedic faculty course directors plan to continue to develop course materials and pedagogy.

AB  - The main task of the examination is to establish environmental issues in the didactic materials for primary and secondary school in Republic of Serbia. Environmental issues in the secondary school curriculum in Serbia, according to the current educational curricula and educational programs, is limited to general subjects (chemistry and biology above all), and to the subject of Ecology in some profiles of secondary vocational education. There is no equal distribution of the environmental issues in curriculum by subjects, classes and educational levels. In general, in the didactic materials there are about 5,4% environmental issues. Because of the lack of national guidelines and institutional coordination we are not able to make a qualitative leap, and we also need to seek a holistic approach to contribute to education about, in and for the environment.

AB  - Overcoming students' misconceptions may be a challenge when teaching about phenomena such as climate change. Students tend to cite short-term weather effects as evidence to support or refute long-term climate transformations, which displays a fundamental misunderstanding about weather and climate distinctions. Confusion about weather and climate may also reflect student misunderstanding about deep time, a concept that spans several scientific content areas. This study examines the relationships between students' understanding of deep time and their understandings of the distinctions between weather and climate, as well as how these understandings influence students' perceptions about the plausibility of human-induced global climate change. Undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory science class on global climate change completed measures of their (a) understanding of distinctions between weather and climate, (b) knowledge of deep time, and (c) plausibility perceptions of human-induced climate change, both at the beginning and end of the course. The study includes comparison groups of similar students enrolled in introductory physical geography classes. Results revealed that greater knowledge of deep time and increased plausibility perceptions of human-induced climate change provide significant explanation of variance in students' understanding of weather and climate distinctions. Furthermore, students achieve significantly increased understanding of weather and climate, even with brief instruction.

AB  - Preservice teachers in six sections (n = 87) of a sequenced, methodological and process-integrated elementary mathematics/science methods course were able to reconcile an issue centered on a similar area of epistemology. Preservice teachers participated in a science inquiry lesson on biological classification and a mathematics problem-solving lesson on polyhedra. Preservice teachers were asked why it was possible to derive a mathematical formula for polyhedra and not organisms and what this implies about the similarities and differences between the epistemologies of mathematics and science. An area of epistemology known as simplicity was triangulated as "simple versus complex" emerged from the constant comparative method (28%) and "justification and simplicity" (96%) was coded with a content analysis. Implications include how methods course instructors can create other appropriate activities which incorporate and reconcile other areas of epistemology.

AB  - Statistics and statistical literacy can be found in the Learning Areas of Mathematics, Geography, Science, History and the upcoming Business and Economics, as well as in the General Capability of Numeracy and all three Crosscurriculum priorities. The Australian Curriculum affords many exciting and varied entry points for the teaching of statistics. The new curriculum also offers an opportunity to explore the pedagogy of using the statistical investigation process (s-i-p). This is based on the premise that the full statistics cycle really does matter and is fundamental to why statistics is important. The process of starting with a problem, collecting data, analysing data, and interpreting and communicating results is present throughout the curriculum. This discussion paper invites teachers to examine the intention of the curriculum and to identify where the statistics cycle is both explicit and implicit. It is about looking for the commonalities within and across the Learning Areas to support teachers to prepare materials and learning tasks to build statistical capability by understanding the statistical processes underpinning different representations of the cycle.

AB  - Business intelligence (BI) and healthcare analytics are the emerging technologies that provide analytical capability to help healthcare industry improve service quality, reduce cost, and manage risks. However, such component on analytical healthcare data processing is largely missed from current healthcare information technology (HIT) or health informatics (HI) curricula. In this paper, we took an initial step to fill this gap. We investigated the current HIT educational programs, BI industry, and healthcare BI job listings, and students' perceptions of BI and how BI could be incorporated into HIT programs. The student survey results showed strong interests from students in a HIT course containing BI components or a BI course specialized in the healthcare context. Based on the student survey and investigation of BI industry and job market, as well as HIT educational programs, we developed a general curriculum framework and exemplar implementation strategies to demonstrate how BI can be incorporated into an HI or HIT program. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first of its kind. Our approach of integrating information from students, the HIT industry and other HIT programs can also be used as a model for general HIT curriculum development and improvement.

AB  - Science, technology, society, and environment (STSE) education has recently received attention in educational research, policy, and science curricular development. Fewer strides have been made in examining the connections between STSE education and learning/teaching physics. Examples of moving STSE theory into practice within a physics classroom can be found in the educational literature and are alluded to the physics literature. This article examines the literature on connecting STSE to physics and attempting to find relevancy for students learning the science from educationalists' and physicists' perspectives.

AB  - Metabolism is a dynamic, simultaneous, and integrative science that cuts across nutrition, biochemistry, and physiology. Teaching this science can be a challenge. The use of a scenario-based, visually appealing, interactive, computer-animated CD may overcome the limitations of learning "one pathway at a time" and engage two- and four-year college students in a deep understanding of integrative metabolism.

AB  - The nature of moral values has occupied philosophers and educationalists for centuries and a variety of claims have been made about their origin and status. One tradition suggests they may be thoughts in the mind of God; another that they are eternal truths to be reached by rational reflection (much like the truths of mathematics) or alternatively through intuition; another that they are social conventions; and another (from the logical positivists) that they are not verifiable facts but simply the expression of emotional likes and dislikes. Standard introductory texts (e.g., Bowie 2004; Vardy and Grosch 1999) on the subject of ethics rarely mention Darwin or Darwinism (Mepham 2005 is a useful exception) possibly mindful of the fact that the relationship of evolutionary biology to moral questions has had a troublesome history. The effect of this has been that whole generations of moral philosophers have given the biological sciences a wide berth and consequently often remain poorly informed about recent advances in evolutionary thought and the neurosciences. On the other hand, scientists have developed interesting models of the evolution of the moral sentiments and are using new imaging techniques to explore the centres of the brain associated with emotion and motivation, but many have been fearful of committing the naturalistic fallacy and so have steered clear of extrapolating their findings to ethical questions. No one after all wants to be seen to be committing an elementary logical blunder. But in the last 20 years, evolutionary biologists have regained the confidence to explore the implications of evolution for the study of ethics (de Waal 1996; Wilson 1998; Wright 1994; Greene 2003). This paper is designed to encourage those entrusted with the teaching of ethics to be open to the potential of Darwinism as a source of ideas on the origins and status of ethical thought and behaviour. It is also hoped that it will illustrate for science educators the enormous explanatory power inherent in Darwinian thought.

AB  - Numerous authors in the library and information science (LIS) field have called for more authentic collaborative experiences for students in school librarian education programs, particularly experiences that partner school library students with pre-service teachers to collaboratively design instruction. The first-iteration, design-based study described below examines the impact of such a project, a collaborative science-focused lesson plan assignment given to pre-service elementary school teachers (PSTs) and pre-service school librarians (PSLs) at a public university in the southeastern United States. Specifically, this paper explores the impact of the project on school library students' understanding of collaboration between teachers and school librarians, particularly science-focused collaboration, and examines the features of the assignment that either facilitated or hindered their progress toward improved understanding. Based on the results of this project, we provide recommendations for school librarian educators interested in designing and implementing similar projects.

AB  - The goal of this study was to test the effectiveness of integrating science and societal implication on adolescents' positive thinking and emotional perceptions about learning science. Twenty-five eighth-grade Taiwanese adolescents (9 boys and 16 girls) volunteered to participate in a 12-week intervention and formed the experimental group. Fifty-seven eighth-grade Taiwanese adolescents (30 boys and 27 girls) volunteered to participate in the assessments and were used as the comparison group. Additionally, 15 experimental students were recruited to be observed and interviewed. Paired "t"-tests, correlations, and analyses of covariance assessed the similarity and differences between groups. The findings were that the experimental group significantly outperformed its counterpart on positive thinking and emotional perceptions, and all participants' positive thinking scores were significantly related to their emotional perceptions about learning science. Recommendations for integrating science and societal implication for adolescents are provided. (Contains 6 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - While teaching science in an alternative arts high school, the author continuously addresses the challenge of welcoming creative, right-brained students into the world of systematic inquiry. Busily mixing paint colors, choreographing futuristic dances, performing comedic theater, and practicing the banjo, the students rarely initiate authentic science endeavors. In this article, the author assigns two arts-based science projects to bridge the gap between students' artistic reality and scientific possibilities. These two projects focus on immunology and human evolution. Immunology lends itself to a guided inquiry lesson in which students receive specific direction regarding the nature and content of their projects. Students completing artwork related to human evolution explored the subject via an open inquiry format. These lessons guide students through diverse avenues of creative thought that lead to a common understanding of science principles. Based on their success with these projects, the students gain an increased comfort level in science. These activities are useful to teachers in a variety of school settings, as the lessons embrace differences in student learning styles. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - Various socioscientific issues (SSIs) are emerging in today's science--and technology--dominant society, e.g. genetically modified organisms and global warming. To achieve the goal of scientific literacy, more and more science educators have devoted their attention to enhancing students' understanding of the multidimensional aspects of SSIs as well as students' abilities to make informed arguments about SSIs. The purpose of this article is to introduce a cross-disciplinary teaching approach, "post it", to engage teachers from different disciplines in promoting students' understanding of the multidimensional aspects of SSIs and informal argumentation skills.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of introducing active methodologies in the Computer Architecture course taught in the second year of the Computer Engineering Bachelor's degree program at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Spain. The paper reports the experience from three academic years, 2011-2012, 2012-2013, and 2013-2014, in which three types of data were considered for analysis: students' dedication, as measured by time spent on the project, their marks, and their level of satisfaction. The study shows that about 86% of students are satisfied with the teaching methodology and are willing to continue using it in future courses. The study also shows that the active methodologies used contribute to the students' cross-curricular training and do not generate any great increase in student workload. Finally, a statistical analysis of the evolution of student performance showed that marks improved to a statistically significant extent after introducing active methodologies.

AB  - Although Darwinism has gained a foothold in the social sciences, in the humanities, with a few exceptions, it is still largely rejected--not, as some would claim, because humanists are all radical poststructuralists who deny that material reality exists, but rather because, with notable exceptions, Darwinists who work within the humanities have adopted a trenchant "us against them," in-group/out-group mentality that has done a good deal more harm than good. In order for evolution to be effectively taught as part of a humanistic approach to literature and art, a more productive, truly "two way" approach is necessary, and must do more than impose the scientific method on the humanities. When this kind of imposition occurs, the humanities are treated "only" as subject matter, thereby discounting historical and interpretive research that is invaluable to scientists and claims they might make in these areas. This paper claims that for evolution to function as a paradigm with true explanatory power across disciplines, scientifically oriented evolutionists need training in humanistic methodologies just as much as humanistically oriented evolutionists need training in the scientific method. Evolution, in this context, becomes not the paradigm that can explain everything from a scientific point of view but rather the beginnings of a conversation about lower and upper level questions, and how these questions might inform and enrich each other's research.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to review the literature published during the last 20 years that investigates the impact of approaches that describe themselves as integrating science and language arts on student learning and/or attitude at the elementary level. The majority of papers report that integrated approaches led to greater student achievement in science and language arts across elementary grade levels. Additionally, integrated approaches facilitate improved attitudes toward both science and reading. The second section of the findings provides an overview of the types of pedagogical approaches used in the classrooms described in the studies. At all grade levels, teachers linked a variety of strategies including read-alouds, independent reading, at home reading, and writing in various genres that connected hands-on science activities to language arts skills.

AB  - How can classrooms become communities of inquiry that connect intellectually challenging science content with language-based activities (opportunities to talk, listen, read, and write) especially in settings with diverse populations? This question guided a 3-year mixed-methods research study using the Science Writing Heuristic (SWH) approach in cooperation with 2 universities, area education agencies, 6 school districts, 32 elementary teachers, and over 700 students each year. The participating teachers engaged in a yearly summer institute, planned units, implemented this curriculum in the classroom, and contributed to ongoing data collection and analysis. Findings demonstrate that critical embedded language opportunities contribute to an increase in student Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) scores in science and language based on level of implementation particularly for elementary students who receive free and reduced lunch (an indicator of living at the poverty level).

AB  - In this article, the authors describe a cross-curricular project designed to enhance learning about micro-organisms. This project includes studies in art and poetry, not subjects that teachers would think of linking with science, however research notes that scientists and poets share the ability to pay close attention to things, a key skill also shared with artists. The stimulus for this work was images of yeast cells taken with a microscope, which provided a window into the "hidden world" of micro-organisms. The authors reference the work of Charlene Czerniak (2007), who described several different models for planning a cross-curricular study, one of which is what she called the "process approach," when similar skills and processes are taught across different subjects. The world of micro-organisms is just one of many "hidden worlds" waiting for students to observe. Poetry and art give children the opportunity to respond to the awe and wonder aspect of the science curriculum.

AB  - The current study investigated the effects of repeated readings to a fluency criterion with science text for seven students with disabilities using multiple probe multiple baselines across participants. Results indicated students met criteria on four consecutive passages. As shown on Standard Celeration Charts a majority of students' correct words per minute accelerated while incorrect words per minute decelerated on successive initial, intervention readings demonstrating reading transfer. Students' reading scores during post-test and maintenance out performed pre-test and baseline readings providing additional measures of reading transfer. The study also suggested a relationship with comprehension; students scored higher on oral retell measures after meeting criterion when compared to initial readings. Overall, repeated readings to a fluency criterion intervention improved science reading fluency for students with disabilities. (Contains 3 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - In this short paper, avowedly personal, partial and pointillist in nature, I (i) sketch the early days of (mainly Anglo-American) information studies and the field's gradual institutionalization, (ii) describe its maturation, as both an academic discipline and a domain of professional practice, and (iii) speculate on its future in the light of oft expressed predictions of its imminent demise as an autonomous enterprise within the academy. I invoke import-export data to demonstrate the newfound outer-directedness of the field and the growing attractiveness of its research to cognate disciplines. However, I also argue that the permeability of contemporary information studies' boundaries may in fact be the cause of its eventual undoing: in short, epistemic promiscuity comes at a price.

AB  - Science teachers know that the mathematics concepts taught in the Common Core are critical for students' understanding of science. But what can a teacher do when his/her students lack the necessary mathematics skills to master science content? There may be other reasons besides students not paying attention in their math courses. Maybe the required math has been taught once and then forgotten. Maybe it is brand new, so students are not ready to apply it yet. Or maybe the necessary mathematical concepts have not been taught at all. When teaching one's subject area is dependent, at least in part, on student understanding of concepts taught in other classes, it becomes even more important to identify and bridge gaps in understanding as they arise. This provides a key opportunity for collaboration across content areas. Math teachers can be called in to explain to the science teacher where the gaps in student knowledge are likely to be--not only in general, but for specific students, based on their performance in class and standardized test scores. This article discusses what teachers need to do when their students lack the necessary math skills to master science content. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - In response to international concerns about scientific literacy and students' waning interest in school science, this study investigated the effects of a science-writing project about the socioscientific issue (SSI) of biosecurity on the development of students' scientific literacy. Students generated two "BioStories" each that merged scientific information with the narrative storylines in the project. The study was conducted in two phases. In the exploratory phase, a qualitative case study of a sixth-grade class involving classroom observations and interviews informed the design of the second, confirmatory phase of the study, which was conducted at a different school. This phase involved a mixed methods approach featuring a quasi-experimental design with two classes of Australian middle school students (i.e., sixth grade, 11 years of age, n = 55). The results support the argument that writing the sequence of stories helped the students become more familiar with biosecurity issues, develop a deeper understanding of related biological concepts, and improve their interest in science. On the basis of these findings, teachers should be encouraged to engage their students in the practice of writing about SSI in a way that integrates scientific information into narrative storylines. Extending the practice to older students and exploring additional issues related to writing about SSI are recommended for further research. (Contains 1 note, 3 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - One of the strong trends in medical education today is the integration of the humanities into the basic medical curriculum. The anatomy program is an obvious choice for using the humanities to develop professionalism and ethical values. They can also be used to develop close observational skills. Many medical schools have developed formal art observation training in conjunction with nearby art museums to enhance the visual diagnostic skills of their medical students. We report here on an art and anatomy workshop that paired medical and art students who did drawing exercises from plastinated anatomical specimens and the animated face to hone observational skills. Each member of the pair brought a different perspective and expertise to the work that allowed each to be a mentor to the other. The workshop had three sessions: the first involved drawings of plastinated specimens that allowed an intimate experience with authentic human material; the second involved drawings of the human face; and the third included examination of anatomical texts of important anatomist-artists, a lecture on contemporary artists whose work involves anatomy, and a film demonstrating the facial muscles. We propose workshops such as these will help students increase their ability to detect details. This will assist the medical student in developing diagnostic skills for identifying disease and the art student in using the human body as subject. We further propose that these programs will help students develop humanistic sensitivities and provide an outlet for expression of the emotional aspects of dealing with disease and mortality.

AB  - Two of the most influential works of the Western nineteenth century were completed in 1859: Charles Darwin's "The Origin of Species" and Richard Wagner's opera "Tristan and Isolde." Although created within very different cultural traditions, these works show some striking similarities: both brought about a critical, long-lasting debate and caused conflicting reactions after their publications, and both had fundamental and compelling impact on their disciplines. In this article, the author focuses on the following questions: (1) How is the idea of evolution expressed in "The Origin of Species" and "Tristan and Isolde"? (2) What are common essences of that which Darwin referred to as "descent with modifications" and Wagner to as "becoming" ("das Werden")? (3) What educational potential exists for exploring and understanding evolution when comparing its historical emergences in biology and music? Using a phenomenological approach, the author aims to survey, describe, and compare significant parallels between the two works. He expands the comparison of the two works to considerations of how teachers can facilitate students' meaningful learning of evolution and which joint role art and science might play.

AB  - Korea has recently started to implement a STEM-like approach in K-12 education, titled STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) curriculum, to educate the next generation of students to become creative innovators. As this approach has been shown to increase educational success, it is vital to prepare and develop interest in middle school students to participate in STEAM subjects-related learning opportunities. This study examined the impact of hands-on global climate change monitoring projects whose curriculum was designed based on the six structured inventive thinking (SSIT) approach that can facilitate the development of the knowledge of STEAM content and investigate the perceptions of STEAM subjects by middle school students. The participants in the study were sixty-eight grade 7 students from a middle school in Seoul, Korea. Employing a quasi-experimental research design, the participants were measured on their STEAM knowledge and perceptions before and after participation. The findings indicate that students who participated in global climate change monitoring activities reported gains in their STEAM content knowledge and showed an improvement in their perceptions of STEAM subjects. The latter finding was more pronounced for female students who had significantly higher science achievement and positive perceptions of the STEAM program than for male students. The results of this study suggest that carefully designed projects comprised of SSIT-based environmental activities can be effective in STEAM education at the middle school level.

AB  - Interprofessional education (IPE) for health and social care students may improve attitudes toward IPE and interprofessional collaboration (IPC). The quality of research on the association between IPE and attitudes is mediocre and IPE effect sizes are unknown. Students at a college in Toronto, Canada, attended an IPE workshop. A comparison group of non-attenders was formed. Both groups completed pre- and post-workshop questionnaires and two measurement scales for IPE attitudes--the Interprofessional Education Perceptions Scale and the University of West England questionnaire. Eight multiple linear regressions modeled post-workshop attitude scores as a function of workshop attendance, pre-workshop attitudes, and background factors. Workshop effect sizes and relative importance of variables were estimated. Published results were used to calculate IPE effect sizes in other studies. Pre-workshop measures of post-workshop attitudes were dominant, positive predictors of outcomes; other predictors were subordinate to them. The relationship between workshop attendance and IPE attitudes was positive in seven models, statistically significant in four (P less than 0.05), and not statistically significant in four. In hierarchical regressions the average workshop effect was small, about 0.08 in [delta]R[squared] terms, amounting to about one-quarter of a model's explained variance. The workshop was associated with improved IPE and IPC attitudes in some domains but not others. The results should help educators focus IPE efforts on IPE/IPC attitudes where small, short-term improvements can be obtained.

AB  - Historically, biology has not been a heavily quantitative science, but this is changing rapidly (Ewing 2002; Gross 2000; Hastings and palmer 2003; Jungck 2005; Steen 2005). Quantitative approaches now constitute a key tool for modern biologists, yet undergraduate biology courses remain largely qualitative and descriptive. Although biology majors are often required to take a full year of calculus, these courses generally use examples unrelated to biology (Gross 1994) and ignore fields of mathematics that may be more relevant to biology, such as liner algebra or theoretical probability and statistics (NRC 2003). In this series of interactive, web-based modules, students are introduced to the mathematical underpinnings of introductory biology in an informal but powerful way.

AB  - This investigation provides an extensive review of scientific, religious, and otherwise non-scientific factors that may influence student acceptance of biological evolution. We also measure the extent to which students' levels of acceptance changed following an educational experience designed to address an inclusive inventory of factors identified as potentially affecting student acceptance of evolution (n = 81, pre-test/post-test) n = 37, one-year longitudinal). Acceptance of evolution was measured using the Measure of Acceptance of the Theory of Evolution (MATE) instrument among participants enrolled in a secondary-level academic programme during the summer prior to their final year of high school and as they transitioned to the post-secondary level. Student acceptance of evolution was measured to be significantly higher than initial levels both immediately following and over one year after the educational experience. Results reported herein carry implications for future quantitative and qualitative research as well as for cross-disciplinary instruction plans related to evolutionary science and non-scientific factors which may influence student understanding of evolution.

AB  - As teachers of political theory, our goal is not merely to help students understand the abstract reasoning behind key ideas and texts of our discipline. We also wish to convey the historical contexts that informed these ideas and texts, including the political aims of their authors. But the traditional lecture-and-discussion approach tends to obscure the historical and political dimensions of political theory. "Reacting to the Past" historical simulations provide a powerful tool for remedying these shortcomings. The simulations foster three kinds of lessons that are difficult to impart with more traditional approaches. First, they help students see the intimate and reciprocal connections between politics, history, and political philosophy. Second, the simulations bring to light the inherently political dimensions of interpreting key political ideas. Finally, drawing upon the ideas of Hannah Arendt, we argue that the simulations educate students about the nature of freedom and political action. (Contains 2 tables and 5 notes.)

AB  - Unlike students in other engineering disciplines, undergraduates in biological engineering typically have limited opportunity to develop design competencies, and even fewer chances to implement their designed projects. The international Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition is a student Synthetic Biology competition that, in 2009, included 110 teams from across Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the US. Working at their own schools over the summer, the students use a kit of biological parts from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, as well as new parts of their own design, to build biological systems that operate in living cells. Two years of survey data collected from undergraduates after their iGEM experiences in 2007 and 2008 suggest that both learning and identity as a biological engineer increase as a result of iGEM.

AB  - A high proportion of PhD candidates in science and engineering fail to complete their degrees. This paper reports the results of a series of workshops where experienced researchers and supervisors were brought together with PhD students to discuss and develop a model of the PhD process. The objective was to help students develop a more rounded and thoughtful approach to their work. The impact of the workshops was assessed by carrying out structured interviews and coding the results to determine the impact on participant perceptions. The analysis suggests that the approach is effective in helping participants to clarify their thinking about the research process in which they are engaged. A proportion of participants appear to have moved from a tactical to a more strategic approach to their research. The study involved students in a postgraduate university but has implications for training of all research students in applied disciplines. (Contains 1 table and 4 figures.)

AB  - This paper describes a series of laboratory exercises for upper level biology courses, independent research and/or honors programs. Students sampled fish from a local water body with the assistance of a local fish and wildlife agency. Tissue samples from collected fish were utilized to obtain estimates of the stable isotopes delta[superscript 13]C and delta[superscript 15]N. An open-source mass balance model was utilized to estimate fish diets from isotope values. Isotopes were also used to measure trophic position (TP) and evaluate dietary niche overlap between native and introduced species. It was found that delta[superscript 15]N concentrations increased with each trophic level starting with benthic algae (lowest) to omnivores, then primary carnivores and ultimately piscivores (highest). Estimates of delta[superscript 13]C suggested all collected taxa utilized littoral habitats for feeding purposes. Native chain pickerel ("Esox niger") had the highest delta[superscript 15]N and TP estimates at 14.4 and 4.11, respectively. Nonnative largemouth bass ("Micropterus salmoides") delta[superscript 15]N and TP estimates were 13.56 and 3.86, respectively. Model estimates suggested that chain pickerel and largemouth bass diets were partitioned: pickerel consumed only fish and bass consumed principally invertebrates with some intermittent fish contributions. This lab helped integrate multiple disciplines, provide practical experience, and encourage critical-thinking skills while educating students about trophic ecology. (Contains 4 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - The Thinking with Data project (TWD) expands on current notions of data literacy by (1) focusing on proportional reasoning as key to data literacy and (2) leveraging the non-mathematics disciplines to engage students in deep thinking about the context of data and the application of proportionality. A set of four 2-week, sequential modules for cross-disciplinary implementation in seventh-grade classrooms was designed and evaluated. Using a quasi-experimental approach, we found that student data literacy was increased through the focused integration of social studies, mathematics, science, and English language arts. In this article, we describe our theoretical approach to designing and implementing the modules, report on student learning gains in mathematics, and describe teacher reactions to the materials. In sum, our study provides evidence that the TWD approach has the potential to build data literacy while also allowing students to learn core discipline-based content standards.

AB  - Politics and economics interact. As a consequence, political science textbooks must often relate to the economic dimension--implicitly or explicitly. But we know very little about how these textbooks relate to economics. Are they merely unreflective customers of neoclassical economics or do they strive for a cross-disciplinary approach? An analysis of five American textbooks identifies two very different and concurrent interactions between politics and economics. The first is a theoretically conceived market economy in which market forces independently drive growth and create equilibrium, where politics has a rather secluded role. The second is the actually existing mixed economy, characterized by increased inequality, economic concentration, power, and environmental problems, influenced by a state forced to regulate. The problems of operating with such a dichotomy--and possible solutions to it--are being explored in the article. (Contains 3 tables and 23 notes.)

AB  - Young-earth creationism has undergone a shift in emphasis toward building of historical models that incorporate Biblical and scientific evidence and the acceptance of scientific conclusions that were formerly rejected. The RATE Group admitted that massive amounts of radioactive decay occurred during earth history but proposed a period of accelerated decay during Noah's Flood to fit the resulting history into a young-earth timeframe. Finding a mechanism for the acceleration and dealing with the excessive heat and radiation it would generate posed major problems for the project. Catastrophic plate tectonics was proposed to explain continental movements in a short timeframe and serve as a trigger for Noah's Flood, but other creationists rejected the idea citing hopeless chronological problems. Creationists have also sought to explain the order of the fossil record and the Ice Age in a young-earth timeframe. An examination of these efforts demonstrates the anti-scientific nature of using the Bible as a non-negotiable framework for earth history.

AB  - Increasing college degree attainment for students from disadvantaged backgrounds is a prominent component of numerous state and federal legislation focused on higher education. In 1999, the National Science Foundation (NSF) instituted the "Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships" (CSEMS) program; this initiative was designed to provide greater access and support to academically talented students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Originally intended to provide financial support to lower income students, this NSF program also advocated that additional professional development and advising would be strategies to increase undergraduate persistence to graduation. This innovative program for economically disadvantaged students was extended in 2004 to include students from other disciplines including the physical and life sciences as well as the technology fields, and the new name of the program was Scholarships for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM). The implementation of these two programs in Louisiana State University (LSU) has shown significant and measurable success since 2000, making LSU a Model University in providing support to economically disadvantaged students within the STEM disciplines. The achievement of these programs is evidenced by the graduation rates of its participants. This report provides details on the educational model employed through the CSEMS/S-STEM projects at LSU and provides a path to success for increasing student retention rates in STEM disciplines. While the LSU's experience is presented as a case study, the potential relevance of this innovative mentoring program in conjunction with the financial support system is discussed in detail.

AB  - Biological problems in the twenty-first century are complex and require mathematical insight, often resulting in mathematical models of biological systems. Building mathematical-biological models requires cooperation among biologists and mathematicians, and mastery of building models. A new course in mathematical modeling presented the opportunity to build both content and process learning of mathematical models, the modeling process, and the cooperative process. There was little guidance from the literature on how to build such a course. Here, I describe the iterative process of developing such a course, beginning with objectives and choosing content and process competencies to fulfill the objectives. I include some inductive heuristics for instructors seeking guidance in planning and developing their own courses, and I illustrate with a description of one instructional model cycle. Students completing this class reported gains in learning of modeling content, the modeling process, and cooperative skills. Student content and process mastery increased, as assessed on several objective-driven metrics in many types of assessments. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - This article is an attempt to reflect on the institutional and disciplinary context of a course on "Race, Gender and Sexuality in the Information Professions" from the perspective of instructors and students. It examines the effectiveness of a course like this as an intervention to the normative landscape of the Library and Information Science (LIS) field that often privileges White, male, middle-class, heterosexual, U.S.-based values and interests. In this article we provide a brief background for the re-establishment of this course, offer a literature review defining the normative landscape of LIS, and discuss the positive aspects and pitfalls of injecting this course into the curriculum as a "diversity" intervention. Finally, we offer recommendations for how to further make visible and shift the hegemonic landscape in LIS toward an inclusivity that actively deals with how race, gender, class, and sexuality deeply informs our profession.

AB  - Students can learn subjects more meaningfully through integrated education, as it helps them to link school education with their real lives. There is a strong need to develop an alternative integration method to promote effective implementation of integrated education at a classroom level. The purpose of this study was to develop a model for instructional design for the integration of mathematics and science, and to design and implement instructions using the developed model. The implications of applying the model to lower grade students in Korea were also discussed.

AB  - Role-play provides fifth-grade students with the opportunity to develop meaningful connections to environmental science concepts and understand how those concepts relate to their community. Role-play also builds students' communication skills and increases their understanding of the attitudes of science. By participating in role-play, teachers develop a learning community that respects and values diverse opinions while constructing a deeper understanding of local environmental issues. This article describes a role-play activity which focuses on community activists trying to discourage people from planting nonnative plants (i.e., Bradford pear trees). The idea for this role-play came from local news stories about certain community members' dislike for Bradford pear trees and their potential as an invasive species. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Children (10 or 11 years old) with and without developmental coordination disorder (DCD) were exposed to imposed optic flow in a moving room. We manipulated the amplitude and frequency of oscillatory room motion, and we evaluated the coupling of standing body sway with room oscillations. The results revealed that standing sway of both children with and without DCD was influenced by room motion. However, children with DCD responded differently than children without DCD to specific combinations of room motion amplitude and frequency. We conclude that DCD can influence a child's use of imposed optic flow for postural control and that these effects are situation-specific rather than being systemic.

AB  - Art and science are intrinsically linked; the essence of art and science is discovery. Both artists and scientists work in a systematic but creative way--knowledge and understanding are built up through pieces of art or a series of labs. In the classroom, integrating science and visual art can provide students with the latitude to think, discover, and make connections. Located in Washington, DC, The Lab School of Washington is a school for grades 1-12 who have students with language-based learning disabilities. In the reading, writing and math classes of the junior high school, students are grouped by their skill levels. In the science classes, the students represent many different skill levels. There are many ways to employ visual art in the science classroom. Art-based activities can help students comprehend abstract scientific theories and improve their critical thinking skills. This article offers examples of art-based projects which can be done in science classes.

AB  - In scientific teaching, especially in physics and chemistry, some historical aspects have been introduced at the secondary level in France, since 1993. Particularly, in 2007, the syllabuses of 11'-15' years old level ("college") propose precise activities in history of science and technology. Detailed guidance has been distributed in official ministerial literature. The invention of Volta's battery in 1800 is one of the examples proposed, which is detailed here.

AB  - Science and design and technology (D&T) are often linked, either formally in the curriculum or by making connections in and between lessons. There has been much debate about how this linking serves the needs of the two subjects and what, in practice, the actual relationship is, as the current English National Curriculum (DfEE, 1999) identifies them as separate subjects. This is in opposition to an earlier view, that is pre National Curriculum, that they could be treated as one indistinguishable area of learning characterised by problem-solving activities. In this article the authors discuss the whys and hows of linking science with design and technology. (Contains 4 figures and 2 boxes.)

AB  - Advances in neuroscience have brought new insights to the development of cognitive functions. These data are of considerable interest to educators concerned with how students learn. This review documents some of the recent findings in neuroscience, which is richer in describing cognitive functions than affective aspects of learning. A brief overview is presented here of the techniques used to generate data from imaging and how these findings have the possibility to inform educators. There are implications for considering the impact of neuroscience at all levels of education--from the classroom teacher and practitioner to policy. This relatively new cross-disciplinary area of research implies a need for educators and scientists to engage with each other. What questions are emerging through such dialogues between educators and scientists are likely to shed light on, for example, reward, motivation, working memory, learning difficulties, bilingualism and child development. The sciences of learning are entering a new paradigm. (Contains 2 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - In their article "Innovations in Setting Performance Standards for K-12 Test-Based Accountability," Kristen Huff and Barbara S. Plake (2010) lay out three preconditions for continued investment in standard-setting methodology and practice, all focused on the sound development and use of achievement level descriptors (ALDs). Among these preconditions is the use of "empirically-based learning progressions" to inform the articulation of ALDs, drawing upon information about ways in which students make progress towards "more sophisticated, deep understanding". Huff and Plake argue that these ALDs (and, by extension, learning progressions) should then drive test design and item development for educational accountability systems. Learning progressions are proposed as a means of ensuring that students "learn age-appropriate versions of core ideas" through their influence on both curriculum and standards. In this commentary, the author explores several challenges that must be considered in order to make progress toward Huff and Plake's (2010) vision of the way in which learning progressions might inform ALDs and, thus, test design for educational accountability systems. In doing so, the author draws upon recent work on learning progressions in science.

AB  - Using socio-ecological theory, this study explores best practice (educational practices correlated with higher student performance) in middle-school science. Seven schools with consistently higher student performance were compared with three demographically similar, average-performing schools. Best practice included instructional approaches (relevance and engagement, inquiry, differentiated instruction, collaborative work, moderate amounts of homework, and integration of language literacy and science) and administrative practices (nurturing a climate of opportunity to succeed in science, offering professional development based on data and dialogue, engaging teachers in standards-based curriculum revision and alignment, and recruiting the right fit of teacher). It is argued that best practice entails multiple levels of teaching and administrative praxis that together form a school-wide socio-ecological system conducive to higher performance.

AB  - Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) teachers teach multiple concepts that lend themselves to possible collaboration on a daily basis. Much like Metz's (2009) insightful discussion about the importance of science educators creating partnerships in the community "outside the school walls," integrative STEM teaching also requires a commitment to strong partnerships "inside the school walls." STEM partnerships face barriers related to the current perceptions and lack of understanding of STEM teaching and learning. However, there are common characteristics and content that unite the STEM areas, especially science and technology. This article establishes the need for collaboration and explores ways science and technology/engineering teachers can collaborate inside the school walls. This article is based on: (1) exploring enacted curriculum of practicing public school STEM teachers; (2) explaining findings from a practitioner-based study focused on the content taught in science and technology/engineering classrooms; and (3) offering suggestions on how science and technology/engineering teachers can create or enhance partnerships to better utilize the strengths of their disciplines.

AB  - The purpose of the current research was to examine the effects of a sequence of classroom activities that integrated mathematics content with music elements aimed at providing teachers an alternative approach for teaching mathematics. Two classes of third grade students (n = 56) from an elementary school in the west coast of the United States participated in the research. A random assignment pretest-posttest control group design was used to examine students' changes in mathematical ability between the two groups. A quasi-experiment time series design with multiple pretests, midtests and posttests was utilized for investigating the effects of music-mathematics lessons on students' mathematics process ability level. The results demonstrated that the intervention of music-mathematics integrated lessons had statistically significant improvement on the music group students' mathematical abilities.

AB  - This article seeks to contribute to the evolving literature on the scholarship of teaching and learning. We do this by describing and then reflecting on what we have learned from a year-long freshman applied research seminar, "International Affairs Knowledge and U.S. Foreign Policy Opinions." After surveying the literature on public opinion and U.S. foreign policy and materials on survey research and design, the students devised, pretested, administered (to 1300+ undergraduates), analyzed a survey and presented their findings. To do this, we had to provide them, in an abbreviated time frame, survey design, basic statistics as well as statistical software and work with them on how to summarize and present their findings. Their paper (Arbitter et al., 2010), in which some of their findings from the survey accord with the preexisting literature and much of it go beyond that, is one way of assessing our course. But, in this article, we discuss the ways such a course can meet many of the challenges held out to us as educators by such bodies as the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U), especially if those following this path take advantage of the lessons we have learned.

AB  - In a discussion about architecture, the author's students learned that architects must consider their client's needs when designing a home. To complement their study of bird migration in science class, the author decided to ask students to "think like a bird" in order to design wooden birdhouses that they could take home and actually use. This article presents a project which gives students the opportunity to use their knowledge of bird migration and architecture to design and build a better birdhouse and provide a place for neighborhood birds to enjoy as well.

AB  - The ill-structured nature of design problems makes them particularly challenging for problem-based learning. Studio-based learning (SBL), however, has much in common with problem-based learning and indeed has a long history of use in teaching students to solve design problems. The purpose of this ethnographic study of an industrial design class, an architecture class, and three human-computer-interaction classes was to develop a crossdisciplinary understanding of the goals and expectations for students in a SBL environment and the ways in which experienced facilitators assist students in solving complex design problems. The expectations that students are to iteratively generate and refine design solutions, communicate effectively, and collaborate with others establishes the studio as a dynamic place where students learn to experiment on their own, to teach and to use all studio members as resources in that search. Instructors support students as they grapple with complexity of design problem-solving through pedagogical practices that include assignments, associated meta-discussions, explicit prompts, reminders, modeling, and coaching. Using sample illustrations from our cross-case analysis, we present the studio method as a legitimate constituent of problem-based learning methods.

AB  - Developing the connection between biology and mathematics is one of the most important ways to shift the paradigms of both established science disciplines. However, adding some mathematic content to biology or biology content to mathematics is not enough but must be accompanied by development of suitable pedagogical models. I propose a model of pedagogical mathematical biological content knowledge as a feasible starting point for connecting biology and mathematics in schools and universities. The process of connecting these disciplines should start as early as possible in the educational process, in order to produce prepared minds that will be able to combine both disciplines at graduate and postgraduate levels of study. Because teachers are a crucial factor in introducing innovations in education, the first step toward such a goal should be the education of prospective and practicing elementary and secondary school teachers.

AB  - The case study presented in this paper examines the work of one high school chemistry teacher who has integrated guided inquiry into a yearlong, traditional curricular framework in ways that take into account the constraints and realities of her classroom. The study's findings suggest (1) the extent and frequency to which teachers can realistically integrate guided inquiry into existing science curricula, (2) the manner in which teachers can make effective transitions into and out of a guided inquiry, and (3) the way in which teachers can set an overarching goal to bring a driving purpose to all of the guided inquiries that the students experience. Based on the insights gained from the current case study, an argument is made that researchers should examine the practice of other teachers (especially in the common subjects of biology, chemistry, and physics) who have integrated guided inquiry into the fabric of their curricula. By doing so, a library of case studies can be built that will provide science teachers with new ideas on how inquiry can be holistically and productively integrated into yearlong traditional curricular frameworks.

AB  - This study examined the development of two Distance Learning (DL) courses and their effect on students' perceptions and learning experiences. Our study included about 260 science and engineering graduate students. Among them, 105 students were divided into two research groups: on-campus students (N=70) and DL students (N=35). These two groups served as a traditional classroom setting and an online setting, respectively. Data was collected through an online questionnaire consisting of both open-ended and close-ended questions and analyzed via the mixed methods model. Findings indicated that the DL students asserted positive perceptions of their learning experiences compared to the on-campus students. Female DL students were more confident about their ability to communicate with their classmates and lecturers in comparison to their male DL peers. We also found that younger students, in comparison to older ones, held higher positive opinions about the quality of the DL courses and the support they received from the lecturer and the teaching assistants. Content analysis revealed four main categories related to lifelong learning via DL: cognitive and professional skills, affective learning, social interactions, and resource management. Learning about students' perceptions of and experiences in DL is an important step toward improving the next generation of online courses in higher education.

AB  - Information and communication technology (ICT) has become an inseparable part of schoolwork and a goal of education to prepare scientifically literate and digitally competent citizens. Yet the introduction of computers into school work has been much slower than its introduction in other spheres of life. Teachers' lack of knowledge/skills and difficulty in integrating ICT into instruction affect the realization of computer-related goals in schools. Another hidden obstacle that can affect the introduction of computers into the Biology laboratory can be discomfort with the interpretation of graphs obtained by data-loggers. We can group these difficulties with graph outcomes into 4 areas: (1) Explanations of the curves that lie beyond the domain of Biology, in Physics, Chemistry or some other discipline; (2) Hardware properties; (3) Unknown properties of experimental components; (4) Occasional equipment breakdowns or crashes.

AB  - Because quantitative biology requires skills and concepts from a disparate collection of different disciplines, the scientists of the near future will increasingly need to rely on collaborations to produce results. Correspondingly, students in disciplines impacted by quantitative biology will need to be taught how to create and engage in such collaborations. In response to this important curricular need, East Tennessee State University and Georgia Technological University/Emory University cooperated in an unprecedented curricular experiment in which theoretically oriented students at East Tennessee State designed biophysical models that were implemented and tested experimentally by biomedical engineers at the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Technological University and Emory University. Implementing the collaborations between two institutions allowed an assessment of the student collaborations from before the groups of students had met for the first time until after they had finished their projects, thus providing insight about the formation and conduct of such collaborations that could not have been obtained otherwise.

The instructional role of the software was evaluated in a study involving 237 undergraduates. The results suggest that the software fostered transition from lower- to higher-order cognitive reasoning. Common misconceptions regarding microscopic phenomena were also detected and addressed.

From the point of view of a Principal Investigator in a scientific laboratory, this article examines the increasingly dominant role of collaboration in scientific research. In contrast to the "consensus research" model of the sciences, humanists have often viewed the role of collaboration in research with considerable skepticism and have placed greater value on the traditional model of the solitary scholar pursuing knowledge and truth. An examination of some of the distinctive cultural differences between the humanities and sciences suggests that the benefits of collaboration may come to play an increasingly significant role in the future of humanistic research.

AB  - This research was carried out to understand the role of visual arts in the teaching and learning of science among Grade 3 teachers and students. A mixture of qualitative and quantitative research design was used to discover the different perceptions of both teachers and students on the role of visual arts in science. The data for the research was obtained from an international school in Malaysia through a survey distributed to the teachers and students. The researchers identified how the usage of visual arts motivated students to learn science. The research was supported with literature reviews of various educationists. The study found that children's mental and physical development was not merely enhanced and stimulated through the learning of science alone but with the integration of visual arts which aids their growth and progress. The findings also indicated that almost all teachers and students gave positive views for the integration of visual arts in science lessons. Teachers noticed positive changes among their learners as they enjoyed the freedom of choosing their preferred form of art to express their learning of science. Teachers also noticed that integrating visual arts as a medium to teach science motivated students to attain a higher level of achievement. Finally, it is concluded that visual arts play a useful role in the teaching and learning science. Since visual arts has been proven to play an important role in the development of individuals, the researchers advocate for its integration in science lessons at all levels of study to promote higher order thinking skills and abilities to survive in the 21st century.

AB  - Significant limitations have emerged in America's science training pipeline, including inaccessibility, inflexibility, financial limitations, and lack of diversity. We present three effective programs that collectively address these challenges. The programs are grounded in rigorous science and integrate through diverse disciplines across undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, and resonate with the broader community. We discuss these models in the context of current economic constraints on higher education and the urgent need for our institutions to recruit and retain diverse student populations and sustain the successful American record in scientific education and innovation.

AB  - The integration of career and technical education (CTE) and academic curricular content represents a challenge for CTE professionals. Currently, little is known about the process of integrating science into secondary CTE programs. Grounded theory method was employed to create information about CTE teachers' perspectives of and experiences with the process of CTE and science content integration. From the perspective of the CTE teachers involved, integrating CTE and science content resulted in their programs of study being adapted into something very different than they were before the process of integration was begun. The CTE teachers revealed that evolutions in their programs of study and themselves were associated with three other categories within the grounded theory: connecting; enacting; and futuring. The findings indicate that the process of CTE and science content integration represents a deep and complex episode for CTE teachers. The findings also reveal that the process of CTE and science content integration requires connecting to others, putting ideas into action, and an orientation towards the future.

AB  - Alternative teaching styles provide a unique and rewarding approach to reinforcing student knowledge and developing social skills. An approach that we implemented required students from the ecology class to organize and present information at the university-wide Earth Day celebration and exposition. In addition to the informational and research posters presented by the ecology class, the exposition included displays by local environmental groups, local and state agencies, student organizations on campus, research groups from the chemistry department, and an ethics class. We found that the level of student engagement far exceeded our expectations and that the students felt they had made a significant impact on the community. We highly recommend this approach to other faculty. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - In recent years, the topic of integrating history to mathematics lessons in teaching-learning processes has been frequently discussed among researchers. The main aim of this study is to present an example activity which enriched with history of mathematics and to take the views of students about teaching course in this way. In addition, to create awareness about the developmental stages of mathematics up to now is an implicit purpose. This research is a multiple case study. It was studied with twenty one students who continued eighth grade class in a private primary school. Worksheets containing two algorithms about calculating the square roots of numbers which were used in history were given to each student. In addition, after students reached the solution, they compared their results with results which they obtained from the calculator. Thus, they also saw that the calculator's operating system was similar to algorithms they used. Students' opinions about the integration of the history of mathematics to lessons were collected through an interview form. At the end of the activity, students stated that the chosen activities from the history of mathematics had attracted their interests. Also, they found an opportunity to compare different methods.

AB  - At North Carolina A&T State University (NCATSU), there was a critical need to better coordinate genuine research and classroom experiences for undergraduates early in their academic career. We describe the development and implementation of a faculty alliance across academic departments to increase biomathematics research opportunities for underrepresented minorities. Our faculty alliance is called the Integrative Biomathematical Learning and Empowerment Network for Diversity (iBLEND). The fundamental purpose of the iBLEND alliance was to inspire underrepresented minorities to pursue research careers by increasing the visibility of research conducted at the interface of mathematics and biology at NCATSU. Because of the many positive impacts, iBLEND gained significant buy-in from administration, faculty, and students by 1) working from the ground up with administration to promote campus-wide biomathematics research and training, 2) fostering associations between research and regular undergraduate academic courses, 3) creating and disseminating biomathematics teaching and learning modules, and 4) enhancing learning community support at the interface of mathematics and biology. Currently, iBLEND is viewed as a productive site for graduate schools to recruit underrepresented minority students having specific competencies related to mathematical biology. (Contains 8 tables.)

AB  - The integration of career and technical education (CTE) and academic curricular content that capitalizes on natural and inherent connections represents a challenge for CTE professionals. The purpose of this study was to employ Bloom's revised taxonomy (Anderson, Krathwohl, Airasian, Cruiskshank, Mayer, Pintrich, Raths, & Wittrock, 2001) to describe the learning objectives CTE programs operationalized in order to integrate science concepts into classroom and laboratory instructions. The findings illustrate that while 66% of the participating CTE programs were integrating CTE and science curricular content, 88% of the specific integrating learning objectives utilized were characterized as addressing only lower order cognitive processes. It was found that higher order CTE and science integrating learning objectives that addressed procedures or techniques were virtually nonexistent and none of the objectives reviewed addressed metacognitive knowledge. Overall, the findings indicate that the integrating learning objectives that were reviewed tended to be concrete, simple, and have prescribed outcomes.

AB  - This article discusses the results of an exploratory research project in which library and information studies (LIS) faculty and education faculty were asked about their views on teaching pre-service school librarians and teachers 21st Century Skills (as defined by the Partnership for 21st Century Skills) and librarian-teacher collaboration. Researchers used a case-study approach to investigate and compare the views and experiences of LIS faculty and education faculty at a research institution. Participants indicated their sense of which skills were taught in each discipline. In addition, they described their own experiences in collaborating with teachers and/or librarians, as well as their views on where collaboration was taught in their respective curricula, where it could be taught, and how it might be taught most effectively. Findings indicate that while education faculty members tend to have a broader view of LIS than do LIS faculty and see education and LIS as having largely overlapping concerns, collaboration is more likely to be a topic of discussion in LIS classes than in education classes. Faculty in both disciplines acknowledged that, while collaboration is desirable, it is often difficult to achieve in practice. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - Studies have not yet consented whether integrating mathematics into science would enhance students' learning or confuse their understanding of abstract mathematical concepts. In spite of the social need for solving social-scientific problems with multiple facets, there has not been a holistic integration model of the disciplines. Hence, this study aims to propose a theoretical model for curriculum integration of mathematics and science (CIMAS) and to examine experts' opinions about its educational perspectives. The model captures appropriate topics, needs (pedagogical, motivational, and societal), and constraints. In spite of the small size of participants--23 mathematics educators in Ankara, their diverse integration examples reached to the conclusion that all units in the Turkish mathematics curriculum can be integrated with physics, chemistry, or biology (e.g., derivative with linear velocity, ratio with chemical mixture, and probability with genetics), while identifying the most number of examples with physics topics. The expert responses consistently clarified that CIMAS would enhance mathematics education for the pedagogical, motivational, societal, and other needs. However, the integration was also perceived to associate with obstacles with teachers, curricula, and facilities for effective implementation. Lastly, this study further presents a key discussion on how to enlarge the scope of CIMAS in terms of collaboration among mathematics educators.

AB  - To teach science writing effectively, scholars encourage combining writing to learn with applications of the science writing heuristic. How teachers learn to do so remains under-examined. This essay follows a cohort of ninth-grade science teachers who collaborated in a project to develop, test, and revise such a combination of writing prompts for physical science and biology in a high-poverty, urban school district. Students in the project acquired course concepts more readily. In standardized exams designed by the district, they also outperformed students enrolled in the same courses, using the same district curricula. Even special education students demonstrated better progress and retention. In addition, the exams enabled the science teachers to evaluate the curriculum and to consider how writing to learn could redress its weaknesses. Preliminary results of the project suggest that writing to learn--augmented by locally designed standardized tests--might not only transform student learning outcomes, but transform the development of secondary science curricula as well.

AB  - Sustainability education competes for curricular space, both in schools and in teacher education. Opportunities and barriers for the inclusion of sustainability education in an Australian university primary teacher education program are examined in this article. The study focused on the roles, practices and perceptions of teacher educators in promoting sustainability education. Three focus groups were conducted with members of faculty staff from each of the K-6 Key Learning Areas to gather data, which were analysed according to three frameworks: espoused/aspirational and actual practices of staff members; barriers to and affordances for teaching sustainability education; and the nature of initiatives, in terms of teaching/learning activities, assessment tasks, and resources. Beyond the Social Sciences, and Science and Technology, we found that inclusion of sustainability education is somewhat sporadic. The article proposes some ways forward to promote and abet sustainability education in a tertiary context.

AB  - A case study of an exemplary third grade teacher's use of the outdoor classroom for meeting both state science and language arts standards is described. Data from the researcher's field journal, teacher lesson plans, and teacher interviews document how this teacher used nature-study to bridge outdoor classroom experiences with the state science and language arts curriculum. This teacher's early life experiences supported her strong interest in science and nature in the outdoors and experiencing it with her children. Children interacted with the outdoor classroom throughout the day as a context for science and literacy learning. All but one child successfully met Annual Yearly Progress (AYP) goals in reading at the end of the school year.

AB  - This article examines Web resources in research articles from 30 scholarly journals in disciplines across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. The purpose of the study is to report the degree to which scholars make use of Web-based resources in the journal literature and to identify Web citation characteristics within different subject areas. The study also explores whether any changes emerged between 2001 and 2007. The examination confirms the finding of previous studies that, even though Web resources are not heavily used in journal articles, the number of such resources is increasing. Publicly accessible database repositories and open source software prevail over other Web resources in research communication. The implications for academic libraries are discussed. The study suggests that new strategies need to be developed to manage Web-based information resources.

AB  - Through integration of geology, biology, chemistry, and the history of science, the historic Krakatoa eruption offers a unique portal for student inquiry in the classroom. Students are inherently fascinated by natural disasters, and modern comparisons to the Krakatoa cataclysm are as close as the day's news. This article uses the historic Krakatoa cataclysm to teach modern science. It offers background on the Krakatoa eruption and describes the authors' inquiry unit on Krakatoa in detail. This study of Krakatoa offers an opportunity to correct common student misconceptions about volcanoes. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - Science Created by You (SCY) is a project on learning in science and technology domains. SCY uses a pedagogical approach that centres around products, called "emerging learning objects" (ELOs) that are created by students. Students work individually and collaboratively in SCY-Lab (the general SCY learning environment) on "missions" that are guided by socio-scientific questions (for example "How can we design a CO[subscript 2]-friendly house?"). Fulfilling SCY missions requires a combination of knowledge from different content areas (eg, physics, mathematics, biology, as well as social sciences). While on a SCY mission, students perform several types of learning activities that can be characterised as productive processes (experiment, game, share, explain, design, etc), they encounter multiple resources, collaborate with varying coalitions of peers and use changing constellations of tools and scaffolds. The configuration of SCY-Lab is adaptive to the actual learning situation and may provide advice to students on appropriate learning activities, resources, tools and scaffolds, or peer students who can support the learning process. The SCY project aims at students between 12 and 18 years old. In the course of the project, a total of four SCY missions will be developed, of which one is currently available.

AB  - The STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) movement has developed from a non-educational rationale. Although some think it may enliven the delivery of maths and science in classrooms, the social and economic rationales are those that have initiated this movement. Spurred on by the global financial crisis, it is hoped that coordination and integration of STEM activities will better equip a workforce for dealing with the contemporary nature of business and industry, and encourage more school leavers to seek further training and employment in areas of engineering and science. The problem for educators here is that the consequent absence of a sound educational rationale for this combination of subjects inhibits its development. There needs to be a reason for integrating these subjects which relates to quality learning outcomes for students. Given the developing momentum of the STEM agendas, it may be unwise for technology educators to isolate themselves from this movement. In addition, it may be an opportunity to reinforce the place of Technology Education in the school core curriculum. Rather than integration, a more reasonable approach may be to develop interaction between STEM subjects by fostering cross-curricular links in a context where the integrity of each subject remains respected. However, almost as many impediments remain to interaction as to integration: rigid school timetables and curriculum structures, deficient awareness by teachers of other subject areas, inflexible classroom design, and assessment. With a focus on STEM interaction, driven by teachers, interventions can be developed which will overcome these impediments. A focus on STEM integration will not overcome the barriers, and may result in the decimation of technology as a distinct component of the school core curriculum. A STEM orientation, therefore, must be approached with caution.

AB  - Education in nanotechnology presents major challenges in science literacy. One of these challenges relates to conveying size and scale-related concepts. Because of the potential difficulties in conveying concepts and ideas that are not visible to the naked eye, multimedia for learning could be an appropriate vehicle to deliver curricular materials related to nanoscale science and engineering. This study used qualitative and quantitative methods of inquiry to investigate how three different interactive multimedia tools for conveying concepts related to size and scale were perceived and experienced by two groups: (a) 224 novice/pre-service teachers, and (b) 8 instructional designers and trainers of pre-service teachers. Differences found between what these teachers and what instructional designers noticed about the interactive multimedia tools can inform the design of learning strategies for pre-service teachers training on the adoption and evaluation of multimedia for learning. Specifically, pre-service teachers focused on classroom management issues, but the instructional designers focused on aspects of instructional design and pedagogy. These issues are discussed, along with implications of the role of technology integration and the effective design of interactive multimedia in learning. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)

AB  - Advocates of the arts agree that the K-12 curriculum should include dedicated time for arts instruction. Some have argued further that knowledge and skills acquired through the arts transfer to nonarts domains. Others claim that evidence of this kind of transfer is limited and instead argue that the arts cultivate valuable dispositions that help students succeed both in and outside of school. Another potential benefit of the arts has received little attention, however. Arts integration--the use of the arts as a teaching methodology throughout the curriculum--may improve long-term retention of content. A variety of long-term memory effects well known in cognitive psychology are reviewed, and it is argued that arts integration naturally takes advantage of these effects while promoting student motivation. This review of findings and applications provides an example of how existing research from neuroscience and cognitive science can inform the work of practicing educators.

AB  - One of the major challenges facing accounting education is the creation of a learning environment that promotes high-quality learning. Comparative research across disciplines offers educators the opportunity to gain a better understanding of the influence of contextual and personal variables on students' learning approaches. Using the Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students (ASSIST), this study examines the learning approaches of 329 first-year accounting students and 275 first-year science students at an Irish university. The analysis reveals that the accounting students are more strategic than the science students, while the science students are more inclined to adopt a deep approach than the accounting students. There was no significant difference in the scores of the two groups on the surface scale. An examination of the variation in the learning environments of the accounting and science students identifies the teaching approach, the level of continuous assessment, students' motivations for choosing their degree programme, and their prior learning experiences as possible factors contributing to the differences in the approaches to learning adopted by both groups. The article concludes by considering the implications of these findings for educators, and suggests avenues for further research. (Contains 1 figure and 2 tables.)

AB  - Problem-solving activities let students use knowledge gained in various areas of their academic education. They bring together skills and knowledge from such areas as science, math, art, and English by simulating activities and projects students will encounter later in career and life experiences. A very important feature of most problem-solving activities is that they can be easily modified to fit different educational programs. The goal in implementing these activities is to give students hands-on experience in a practical and realistic scenario. This article describes bridge-building activity which gives students excellent problem-solving experience and a chance to apply academic learning--and an enjoyable challenge. The activity includes a measurable outcome, which is an additional benefit.

AB  - While the ready-made Lego[TM] Robotics kits are popular in schools and are used by students at both primary and secondary year levels, using the Picaxe microcontroller (chip) to create simple electronic devices, including robotic devices is less popular. The latter imposes an additional challenge as a result of the need to construct the universal board with the chip in it--a challenge embraced in the cross-disciplinary mechatronics program in this study. This paper reports on how teachers from five Australian secondary schools put into practice technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) developed from expert-led workshops and explores factors (intrinsic and extrinsic) that influenced the implementation. The results show that different strategies were adopted by the schools in implementing the programs. While teacher attitude played an important role in influencing the program's success, being able to identify where the program sits within the curriculum and planning around timetable and facility constraints were also important factors to consider. The research indicated that teachers' TPCK was most challenged in non-obvious areas such as diagnosing where faulty soldering joints were.

AB  - The author outlines ways in which conceptions of texts and literacy may be distinctive across academic disciplines. Framed in theories of social semiotics, she asserts that each discipline is recreated through a series of texts, defined broadly to include any instances of communication. Texts in each content area not only instantiate a particular body of content, but also instantiate social practices and roles in relation to that content. After outlining how content and social roles may vary according to each discipline, the author concludes that content area literacy instruction can include encouraging students to recognize and reflect on these differences in texts and the practices surrounding them, thereby helping students to develop metadiscursive frameworks for navigating content area literacies.

AB  - To broaden participation in computing we need to look beyond traditional domains of inquiry and expertise. We present results from a demonstration project in which interactive journalism was used to infuse computational thinking into the standard curriculum and regular classroom experience at a middle school with a diverse population. Outcomes indicate that we were able to develop positive attitudes about computational thinking and programming among students and teachers who did not necessarily view themselves as "math types." By partnering with language arts, technology and math teachers at Fisher Middle School, Ewing New Jersey, we introduced the isomorphism between the journalistic process and computational thinking to 7th and 8th graders. An intense summer institute, first with the teachers and then with students recruited from the school, immersed them in the "newsroom of the future" where they researched and wrote news stories, shot and edited video, and developed procedural animations in Scratch to support their storylines. An afterschool club sustained the experience. The teachers adapted interactive journalism and Scratch programming to enrich standard language arts curriculum and are infusing computational thinking in classroom experiences throughout the school.

AB  - We report the results of a study focused on identifying and articulating an ''epistemic foundation'' underlying a pre-collegiate focus on engineering. We do so in the context of UTeach"Engineering" (UTE), a program supported in part by funding by the National Science Foundation and designed to develop a model approach to address the systematic challenges facing this work--from identifying learning goals, to certifying pre-and in-service teachers for engineering courses to developing a research-based high school engineering course. Given the systemic nature of the UTE approach, this model is positioned to serve as a starting point to further the conversation around two of the National Academy of Engineering Committee on Standards in K-12 Engineering Education (2010) central recommendations for future work in this area: (1) Identification of core ideas in engineering, and (2) creation of guidelines for instructional materials. Toward that end, project faculty and staff were interviewed and/or surveyed about their views on the goals and outcomes of engineering and engineering teacher education, as well as strategies design to reach these goals and the warrants for them. Data were analyzed following a grounded protocol. The results align well with previous efforts to identify ''core engineering concepts, skills, and dispositions for K-12 education'' (National Academy of Engineering Committee on Standards in K-12 Engineering Education, 2010, Annex to Chapter 3).

AB  - This paper reports on research from a network of high school and museum partnerships designed to explore techniques for integrating mathematics and physics learning experiences during the first year of high school. The foundation of the curriculum is a problem-based, museum-based, and hands-on approach to mathematics and physics. In this paper, we ask: How does the materiality of this curriculum allow students to think about mathematics in different ways? We first discuss advantages associated with museum-integrated curriculum, and point to how these are related to materialist and embodied theories of learning. We then focus on video data collected during a wing-design lesson, and discuss patterns in students' participation. We show how (1) integrated curriculum creates opportunities for embodied learning experiences in mathematics, (2) gesture and touch are important facets of learning abstract concepts in mathematics and physics, and (3) museum-situated activities contest philosophical assumptions about the nature of mathematics.

AB  - Critical reading of science-based media reports is an authentic context in which to explore the mutual interests of teachers of science and English, who want to use science in the media to promote their subject discipline while encouraging cross-curricular learning. This empirical study focused on 90 teachers of science and English to explore their aptitude and capability for critical reading of science-based news reports. The influences of specialist subject culture and the extent of classroom experience contributed to the distinctive nature of the responses. The study revealed features in critical reading that were characteristic of the subject background of the participants. It suggested approaches to initial teacher education and ongoing professional development that would be mutually beneficial to teachers from different disciplines in promoting among pupils a critical approach to science-related news media.

AB  - This paper explores one district's attempt to implement a blended science and English Language Development (ELD) elementary program, designed to provide English language learners opportunities to develop proficiency in English through participation in inquiry-based science. This process resulted in blended program that utilized a combined science/ELD lesson plan format to structure and guide teachers' efforts to use science as the context for language development. Data, collected throughout the first 2 years of the program, include teacher-generated lesson plans, observation notes, and interviews with teachers and principals. The process by which the blended program was developed, the initial implementation of the program, the resulting science/ELD lesson plan format, and teachers' perceptions about the program and its impact on their students are described.

This is one significant aspect of modular degrees which has not been studied. In an effort to better understand this issue, the research reported in this paper explored the experiences: (1) of students taking modules from outside their programme of study and; (2) of staff teaching modules with significant numbers of students from other programmes. In total, 820 undergraduate students responded to an on-line survey; 12 academic staff members participated in interviews. The survey focused on students' reasons for choosing the module, their experiences of assessment and their perceptions of workload. Interviews with academic staff focused on the influence of non-programme students on teaching and assessment practices. The discussion addresses the implications of student choice and classroom diversity for teaching and assessment in modular systems. (Contains 2 figures, 2 tables, and 1 note.)

AB  - To keep up with rapidly advancing technology, numerous innovations to the electrical and computer engineering (ECE) curriculum, learning methods and pedagogy have been envisioned, tested, and implemented. It is safe to say that no single approach will work for all of the diverse ECE technologies and every type of learner. However, a few key innovations appear useful in keeping undergraduate students motivated to learn, resilient to technology evolution, and oriented amid the overload of new information and ECE applications. Engineering clinics, similar to their medical clinic counterparts, provide project-based experiences within the core of an ECE education that enable transformation of the entire curriculum toward an outcomes-oriented, student-centered, total-quality environment. Clinics and project-based learning approaches build skills that give the students confidence and motivation to continuously self-learn and adapt as the technologies around them give way to new, more effective paradigms. Perhaps more importantly, engineering clinic experiences provide numerous opportunities for students to experience the holism of true engineering problem-solving approaches and the ranges of potential technology solutions. This paper reviews the clinic innovations that will enable ECE education to become more effective in the midst of the present plethora of information and technology. Assessment results are provided and are very encouraging. This paper concludes that agile learning environments, created to graduate engineers who can be rapidly productive in the professional and research worlds, are enhanced by clinic and/or project-based learning experiences in the ECE curriculum.

AB  - In order to examine the implications of applying a teaching strategy that integrates a systems approach and project-based learning (PBL), it was implemented in two courses. The objective of the first course was to train preservice teachers to teach the subject of "Science and Technology to All" (mandatory subject in all of Israel's junior high schools), a mandatory methods course has been developed in the Department of Education in Technology and Science at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology: "Methods for Teaching Science and Technology for All". The course participants were pre-service teachers who were studying toward a teaching certificate in the Department of Education in Science and Technology parallel to their studies for a B.Sc. degree in one of the Technion's science Faculties. Most students in this course lack basic knowledge in engineering and technology. The second course was an introductory freshman course in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. The goal of the second course was to achieve certain objectives through experiential learning. These were to provide students with a clear overview of the different fields in mechanical engineering; to introduce them to the essence of engineering work and the processes of design and development of new technological products; to raise their awareness of the importance and necessity of analysis for finding optimal solutions for engineering problems, and to acquaint freshmen with the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and familiarize them with the different aspects of mechanical engineering expertise (Elata & Garaway, 2002). The innovation here is the integration of PBL and the systems approach, and the implementation of this combination in courses that up until today had been taught in traditional ways. This was an attempt to exploit this integrated approach to teach technology through a top-down process, without explaining the details to students lacking a technological background. This paper describes a qualitative study that followed the progress of the two classes. It presents what was learned during implementation of this approach in these two courses, as well as thoughts on future implications.

AB  - This study describes the characteristics of pre-service teachers' discourse on a WebCT Bulletin Board in their investigations of local streams in an integrated mathematics and science course. A qualitative analysis of data revealed that the pre-service teachers conducted collaborative discourse in framing their research questions, conducting research and writing reports. The science teacher educator provided feedback and carefully crafted prompts to help pre-service teachers develop and refine their work. Overall, the online discourse formats enhance out-of-class communication and support collaborative group work. But the discourse on the critical examination of one another's point of views rooted in scientific inquiry appeared to be missing. It is suggested that pre-service teachers should be given more guidance and opportunities in science courses in carrying out scientific discourse that reflects reform-based scientific inquiry.

AB  - Many educational researchers across the United States have found that inquiry-based learning (IBL) supports the development of deep, meaningful content knowledge. However, integrating IBL into classroom practice has been challenging, in part because of contrasting conceptualizations and practices across educational fields. In this article, we (a) describe differing conceptions of IBL, (b) summarize our own studies of IBL in three fields of education, (c) compare and contrast the processes and purposes of IBL in our studies and fields, and (d) suggest numerous opportunities for cross-disciplinary collaborations on IBL curriculum, teaching, and research that could bolster its inclusion in K-12 education. We ground our exploration in knowledge-generating conceptualizations and practices in these fields.

AB  - In this study we examined curriculum integration in new ways by exploring the link between classroom context, the implementation of community-based, integrated science projects, and the subsequent student learning. The literature is inconsistent regarding the benefits of an integrated approach to curriculum. The research design was a multiple case study conducted in two classrooms in different schools. We employed a "worldly interpretive framework" that recognizes and embraces the importance of context in framing curriculum practices and outcomes. We found that similar projects in the two classrooms produced distinctly different (and equally valid) outcomes--focused either on bounded discipline-specific knowledge or, alternatively, on issues and problems that transcended disciplinary boundaries.

AB  - Much of the literature around the notions of discourse and identity explores how education (particularly higher education) might develop academic discourses and identities in students. There is however a dearth of work relating to what the development of academic discourses and identities in students might mean for the lecturers who teach them. The identities of lecturers, especially those in applied science/engineering fields, are generally framed in terms of their disciplinary affiliation rather than their role as professional educators. This construction of a science/engineering-based identity in many ways militates against the incorporation of an identity as a professional educator. Using narrative methodology, life history approaches and discourse analysis to trace twenty lecturers' perceptions of their changing roles and identities as academics, this paper argues that the incorporation of a professional educator identity would enable the explicit teaching of academic discourses. The findings show that the identity of professional educator can be developed in science/engineering lecturers through their interaction with academic developers from 'other' disciplines such as Education and Language/Linguistics. Bringing academic developers and science/engineering lecturers into dialogue with each other facilitated the development of an alternate identity, that of professional educator, in science/engineering lecturers. The paper concludes that academic developers, through the generic academic literacy courses offered at most tertiary institutions, occupy a space that science/engineering lecturers should be filling, that of inducting students into the discourses of science and engineering. Finally the paper recommends that sustained interaction between academic developers and science/engineering lecturers facilitates a shift in the academic identities of the science/engineering lecturers, towards incorporating an 'otherness' as discourse teachers.

AB  - Preservice teachers enrolled in a science content-based course wrote stories that could help their future students understand a science concept. First, participants chose their topic and wrote the story with few guidelines to establish a baseline. In the next part, a different set of students were given a choice of three topics (based on force, electricity, and heat misconceptions), and collaborated to write stories with guidance from the instructor. Stories were analyzed for narrative and science units, and test scores examined. Without guidance, many students struggled to find ways to integrate science within a story. With guidance, participants wrote stories that included more narrative elements overall, and participants felt the stories helped them understand the concepts.

In this paper, the authors discuss the usefulness of a combined Capstone Experience class consisting of CS/CIS and MIS students. The authors point out how this class provided considerable opportunity for collaborative learning, served as an instrument for assessing the respective program objectives relating to both technical and professional (soft) skills, and met the learning outcomes of the university's general educational requirements.

AB  - Project-based learning (PBL) is a highly effective means of motivating students to learn independently. However, training or encouraging teachers to practice PBL in their classrooms is challenging, especially if the educational system does not accommodate creative teaching practices. In particular, in a test-driven educational system, time constraints and an excess of teaching content makes it difficult to practice PBL at the high school level. This work presents a novel team-teaching model that is based on collaboration between subject teachers and the computer teacher to facilitate PBL in the classroom. A two-year experiment was conducted to study the feasibility of the proposed model, in which the school computer teacher conducts PBL with the 10th grade students in the first year, and subject teachers conduct PBL with the 11th grade students in the second year. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model is feasible in the given educational setting. No class time was lost, and the subject teacher successfully conducted PBL activities. Furthermore, a follow-up survey indicated that the students enjoyed the PBL activities in both classes. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Core concepts can be integrated throughout lower-division science and engineering courses by using a series of related, cross-referenced laboratory experiments. Starting with butane combustion in chemistry, the authors expanded the underlying core concepts of energy transfer into laboratories designed for biology, physics, and engineering. This integrative approach can lead to a better understanding of why energy-transfer steps are involved in metabolism, along with the acquisition of better laboratory skills.

Such discussion would elucidate the meaning of the artworks and, at the same time, challenge students' misconceptions, attracting their attention to the scientific aspects of the art works concerned. This type of learning represents a culturally rich approach to modern science curricula. The simplified contrasting of science and humanities is criticized.

AB  - This article examines the role of gesture in the shared meaning-making processes of 6th-grade students studying plate tectonics using a data visualization tool; specifically, a geographic information system. Students' verbal and gestural characterizations of key concepts of plate motions (i.e., "subduction", "rift", and "buckling") were transcribed and coded across episodes of small-group work during the course of the unit, tracking emergent concepts and their subsequent refinements. The emergence histories of these concepts showed that they were initiated in gesture before they were conveyed in speech. Once they appeared in speech, speech and gesture figured prominently in the further elaboration, modification, and refinement of the key concepts. Gestures introduced by 1 member of the group were picked up and used by peers. Gestures were found to afford joint attention to concepts and negotiation of meaning in the group (e.g., through manual manipulation, imitation, and correction of gestures). These interactions appeared to advance the group's shared understanding of plate tectonics, and to mediate individual student learning. The findings suggest that explicit attention to gesture in instruction and assessment may impact the development of domain understandings in science investigations.

AB  - After 10 years of organizing the Cybertech robotics competition, this paper presents this unique and innovative educational experience of teaching engineering at Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (UPM), Spain. Cybertech is not only a well-known robotic contest in Spain due to the "Robotaurus" bullfighting, but is also a whole academic activity spanning theory, laboratory practical lessons, seminars, tutoring, and a spectacular contest in which robots, developed by the students, compete. It is an open activity, for all students and grades, requiring knowledge of various subjects such as mechanics, microcontrollers, control, and electronics. The experience acquired has shown how this novel educational approach can boost the motivation of students, who in a real applied project effectively learn not only the particular subject matter, but also skills in teamwork, oral presentations, budget management, and so on. This is considered the flagship of innovation in education at UPM. This paper describes the evolution of Cybertech over the past 10 years, summarizes the educational experience, and provides some statistics and results as well as a perspective for future editions of the competition.

AB  - In the digital age, instructional designers must possess both a sound instructional design knowledge base and solid project management skills that will enable them to complete courseware projects on time, on budget and in conformance with client expectations. Project management skills include the ability to apply repeatable processes, along with interpersonal skills such as communication and leadership skills. However, courses in project management are often absent from the higher education instructional design curriculum, creating a gap between what is learned in instructional design programmes and real-world practice. In this paper, the author draws on the education and project management fields to examine this gap. The author argues that the gap between instructional design project management models and how instructional design practitioners view project management is a consequence of the divergent perspectives of higher education subcultures and the extent to which those subcultures are likely to embrace cross-disciplinary subjects such as project management. The author proposes some research and advocacy opportunities for closing the gap between instructional design education and practice.

AB  - The authors describe findings from a research synthesis on content area instruction for students with disabilities. Seventy studies were identified from a comprehensive literature search, examined, and coded for a number of variables, including weighted standardized mean-difference effect sizes. More than 2,400 students were participants in these investigations. Studies included interventions involving content areas, such as science, social studies, and English, and employed a number of different interventions, including study aids, classroom learning strategies, spatial and graphic organizers, mnemonic strategies, hands-on activities, classroom peers, and computer-assisted instruction. The overall effect size was 1.00, indicating an overall large effect across studies. Implications for future research and practice are described. (Contains 2 figures and 9 tables.)

AB  - Understanding the relevance of basic science knowledge in the determination of patient assessment, diagnosis, and treatment is critical to good medical practice. One method often used to direct students in the fundamental process of integrating basic science and clinical information is problem-based learning (PBL). The faculty facilitated small group discussion format traditionally used for PBL is a significant challenge for faculty and facilities with a large class. To provide inductive learning to a large class early in the preclerkship curriculum, a series of online, case-based tutorials was created using the method of inquiry-based learning. The tutorial paradigm is designed to challenge students through a guided inquiry process in which clinical skills and basic science information are seamlessly joined. The psychosocial dimension of patient care is added to the documented case presentation of the tutorials in the form of patient/physician history taking and physical examination videos. These videos augment the written case with additional information providing the student with visual exposure in methods of patient communication and appropriate professional patient/physician interactions that address competencies of patient care, communication, and professionalism. The tutorials were made available via learning management system course sites. The study tracked usage of the tutorials by 270 first-year medical students. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - Over the last decades more and more research has analysed relatively new or rediscovered teaching-learning concepts like blended, hybrid, multi-sensory or technologically enhanced learning. This increased interest in these educational forms can be explained by new exciting discoveries in brain research and cognitive psychology, as well as by the accelerated integration of technology (computers, intranets, internet, etc.) in education. We have investigated how the educationally valuable outcomes of these trends could be implemented in computer-programming education and in what ways this process could be catalysed by arts (dance, music, rhythm, theatrical role-playing). We present a theoretical basis for technologically and artistically enhanced multi-sensory teaching-learning strategies. This work focuses particularly on how dance can be involved in computer science classes. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - This article reported and discussed the evaluation of a lecture, designed to change university students' values related with sustainable ways of living. The outcomes of the study were those obtained from the evaluation of the course titled "Education and Awareness for Sustainability", which has been offered for three years in the Department of Elementary Education, Middle East Technical University-Ankara (Turkey). The study was realized with the participation of 85 students from different faculties (faculty of education, economy, administration and engineering). The study comprised three steps: need assessment (NA), formative evaluation (FE) and summative evaluation (SE). The evaluation model of DIPO emphasizing needs-objectives relationship was used for evaluation. Analyzes, on the other hand, were realized by the use of both qualitative and quantitative research techniques. It was concluded as a result of the study that integrating real life cases with the issues in the course makes students feel comfortable about the course and feel themselves sensitive and responsible.

AB  - Two instructional experiments used randomized, controlled designs to evaluate the effectiveness of writing instruction for students with carefully diagnosed dyslexia, which is both an oral reading and writing disorder, characterized by impaired "word" decoding, reading, and spelling. In Study 1 (4th to 6th grade sample and 7th to 9th grade sample), students were randomly assigned to orthographic or morphological spelling treatment but all students were taught strategies for planning, writing, and reviewing/revising narrative and expository texts. Both treatments resulted in improvement on three measures of spelling and one measure of composition. Morphological treatment resulted in better improvement in spelling pseudowords, whereas orthographic treatment resulted in better improvement in rate of reading pseudowords. In Study 2 (4th to 6th grade sample), students were randomly assigned to explicit language treatment (phonological working memory + phonological-orthographic spelling + science report writing training) or nonverbal problem solving treatment (virtual reality-based computer simulation, drawing maps, and building clay models). Both treatments used science content material and resulted in significant improvement in spelling and reading pseudowords (accuracy and rate). The surprising finding was that hands-on, engaging science problem solving led to more improvement in phonological working memory than did specialized phonological instruction. Only when spelling instruction emphasized orthography or morphology (Study 1) did real word spelling improve.

AB  - Several years ago, after a career of teaching biochemistry and introductory biology, the author decided to offer a course for biology majors on biological explanations of social phenomena (Biosocial Problems in Contemporary America). His goal in examining these topics was to help students develop critical-thinking skills that would allow them to consider the truth of these explanations. In reading any scientific paper, students need to understand the nature of evidence, assess the reliability of data, and recognize how an argument is being presented; in addition they need to assess how political or social dimensions influence what people perceive to be truth. In this article, the author describes Biosocial Problems in Contemporary America, a course on the use and misuse of scientific knowledge. His effort in this course is not primarily to arrive at any final judgments as to the validity of the arguments presented, but rather to explore the criteria for studies that might help to answer the complex issues at the nexus of biology and social issues.

This discussion paper proposes that adoption of the World Health Organisation, International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as a framework for curricula of health professionals promotes the necessary paradigm shift needed to legitimise a broad evidence base as the foundation of interprofessional dialogue. Client function is seen as the product of an open system incorporating the individual, social and environmental influences on behaviour, with the role of the professional being to acknowledge the context of individual behaviour through an understanding of individual's functioning in their environment. It is concluded that client focused practice and an iterative process of clinical reasoning based on a broad evidence base that conceptualises health care as the maintenance and promotion of health across the lifespan requires a re-conceptualising of health. The emerging concept shifts the primary emphasis of health care away from post-diagnosis tertiary care towards clients who maintain a life-long independence in the community.

AB  - As technology and science advance, the boundary between the disciplines begins to blur, emphasizing that it is now, more than ever, a requirement to have a solid background in multiple fields to fully understand emerging scientific advances. As faculty, we need to equip our undergraduate students not only with an introduction to these modern concepts, but also with the ability to apply them in future careers. In order to address this need, we have begun collaborating with faculty outside our individual fields to help educate students in the classroom and aid in our research projects. Specifically, we have combined undergraduate research students from both biology and mathematics departments to work together on projects requiring input from both perspectives. Students work side by side performing experiments, analyzing data, and teaching each other pertinent background information. Students benefit from this research since they encounter real-world data sets whose analysis requires knowledge beyond the typical textbook examples. In addition to performing experiments, students participate in journal clubs to stimulate discussion of experiments and to improve data analysis skills. This type of collaborative learning can also be applied to small classroom settings. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - This paper outlines the results of a collaborative effort between members of staff in the Departments of Life Sciences and Language, Linguistics and Philosophy, which involved the implementation of Writing Across the Curriculum strategies in an Ecology course. The lecturer for this course had expressed concerns regarding the poor quality of the laboratory reports presented and weak essays submitted by students. In order to enhance students' understanding of the content to be included in the report, and to improve expression of thought in writing, we agreed to "treat" a sample of students selected from two laboratory groups by giving each group the other's lab report to read and to subsequently carry out the experiments described. Additionally a select group of students engaged in the planning, writing and revising of responses to past exam essay questions. Results showed that final exam grades for the "treated" group and the writing group were significantly higher than their "non treated" and "non writing" counterparts. Feedback from students was generally positive. Implications and limitations are discussed. (Contains 5 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - In today's technology-laden society human-computer interaction (HCI) is an important knowledge area for computer scientists and software engineers. This paper surveys existing approaches to incorporate HCI into computer science (CS) and such related issues as the perceived gap between the interests of the HCI community and the needs of CS educators. It presents several implementations of the HCI subset of the CC'01 curricular guidelines, targeting CS educators with varying degrees of HCI expertise. These implementations include course/module outlines from freshman to graduate levels, suggested texts, and project ideas and issues, such as programming languages and environments. Most importantly, each outline incorporates Bloom's taxonomy to identify the depth of knowledge to be mastered by students. This paper condenses collaborative contributions of 26 HCI/CS educators aiming to improve HCI coverage in mainstream CS curricula. (Contains 11 tables.)

AB  - Using mini-aquaria experiments, a learning unit on the effects of light period on aquatic ecosystems was developed for 7th grade students. This guided inquiry unit was aimed at helping students understand basic ecological principles involved in relationships among physical, chemical, and biological components in aquatic ecosystems. It involved asking guiding questions to direct students' investigations and experimental designs, providing experimental data for analysis and interpretation, and facilitating students' construction of explanations. The students' achievements were assessed through a questionnaire, written documents, interviews, and classroom observation. In this study, students were encouraged to ask questions throughout the learning sequence, in which they did ask more intelligent questions, generate fruitful ideas, and finally develop their own understanding. Students gradually accumulated conceptual understanding through the designed learning activities, and both students and teachers had a positive attitude toward the learning unit. The minimum and maximum values of the students' perceptions on the learning unit were found to be 4.14 and 4.65 (on a 5-point scale). The mean and standard deviation of the 15 items on perception were 4.41 and 0.41, indicating a moderate level of approval. One advantage of this learning unit is in its low cost for implementation while producing effective learning activities, especially in schools with budgetary and time constraints. This study should inspire teachers to adapt and adopt the proposed activities to enhance students' understanding of the ecosystems. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - This paper elaborates possibilities and limitations for sex education in schools by mapping the consequence of introducing the topic "sex" within a range of scientific and informal discursive settings. The organising and regulating structures of the school maintain the boundaries between common-sense and scientific discourses. Bernstein made a distinction between vertical discourse and horizontal discourses. Vertical discourses characterise scientific discourses that are coherent, explicit and systematically principled structures. Horizontal discourses characterise common-sense discourses that are local, segmented and context-dependent. The implications for teaching sex education through vertical discourses such as science, English and art as opposed to personal and social education, which is a horizontal discourse, are discussed. Yet, all discourses are unstable, and the notion of a "tipping point" is introduced to demonstrate the potential for sex education when vertical discourses collapse. (Contains 1 note.)

AB  - In recent years, a number of analyses assessments used in different countries have appeared. Analyses emerging from international comparisons such as Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) have focused on what might be termed "cross-sectional" comparisons; examining the differences between the assessments in different national systems for students of the same age. Other studies have focused on the study of systems of assessments within a single country, looking at the articulation between the various assessments taken by students at the same ages (another form of cross-sectional analysis within a single system), and by the sequence of assessments taken by an individual over the course of their schooling (a longitudinal focus within a single system). The purpose of this paper is to try to combine both approaches, through the comparison of assessment   "systems". The authors' aim is to look at the differences in assessment systems in different countries in order to try to identify the critical design issues. In this context, design issues are not just the features that are designed into the system by its architects. Design issues also include those features of the system that emerge unplanned, but might have panned out differently if different decisions had been taken in the development of the system (good examples of this latter category are the issue of the rate of increase of spread of attainment in the cohort over time, or sex differences in performance).

AB  - The question of what students gain by engaging in socioscientific inquiry is addressed in two ways. First, relevant literature is surveyed to build the case that socioscientific issues (SSI) can serve as useful contexts for teaching and learning science content. Studies are reviewed which document student gains in discipline specific content knowledge as well as understandings of the nature of science. SSI are also positioned as vehicles for addressing citizenship education within science classrooms. Although the promotion of citizenship goals seems widely advocated, the specifics of how this may be accomplished remain underdeveloped. To address this issue, we introduce "socioscientific reasoning" as a construct which captures a suite of practices fundamental to the negotiation of SSI. In the second phase of the project, interviews with 24 middle school students from classes engaged in socioscientific inquiry serve as the basis for the development of an emergent rubric for socioscientific reasoning. Variation in practices demonstrated by this sample are explored and implications drawn for advancing socioscientific reasoning as an educationally meaningful and assessable construct.

AB  - One of the shortcomings in most efforts to integrate art and science is that many people have a shallow understanding of art, which inevitably leads to shallow connections between art and science. Coloring drawings of planets, building sculptures of volcanoes, and decorating scientific diagrams are fine activities, but they do not link science and art in powerful ways. One way to more deeply connect art and science is to consider art in its more broad form--aesthetics, and in this case, sublime. Aesthetics is the study of beauty, taste, transcendence, and sublime. In aesthetics, sublime describes a feeling of astonishment at a phenomena, event, or experience. This article helps teachers make apparent the artistic concept of sublime as they complete an integrated math/science activity that gives students a better sense of how big "big numbers" really are. As students begin to appreciate the enormity of these numbers--which are used in various science disciplines from geology, astronomy, physics, and more--they can in the same way begin to appreciate the sublime in other areas they observe in the natural environment, thus developing deeper artistic awareness.

AB  - With funding from NSF, the Prime the Pipeline Project (P[cube]) is responding to the need to strengthen the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) pipeline from high school to college by developing and evaluating the scientific village strategy and the culture it creates. The scientific village, a community of high school students, teachers as learners, undergraduate students as mentors, and university scientists as leaders, collaborate to solve challenging long-term problems/projects that develop villagers' expertise with STEM concepts/skills and give them a taste of the work of STEM professionals. Data were collected from both a group of intervention students and a matched control group to address the research question, "Does participation in P[cube] increase students' interest in and success with the study of mathematics and science in high school?" Data were collected through surveys and interviews to address the question, "Does participation in P[cube] change teachers' instructional practice and expectations for student performance?" Results showed that intervention students completed significantly more and more advanced courses in science and mathematics in high school, and their GPAs were significantly higher than their matched controls. Surveys of students' postsecondary plans and intended college majors confirmed increased interest in STEM or business fields. (Contains 9 tables.)

AB  - This paper focuses on the developments experienced by natural philosophy and mathematics in Bologna during a period of rapid change in the relationship of the various disciplines in the faculty of Arts and Medicine. Insisting that university science was characterized by a greater vitality than the traditional historiography usually concedes, this examination first offers some comments about the place of natural philosophy in the Italian universities, then discusses more specifically the University of Bologna. Changes that took place in the funding of natural philosophy, in the designation of astronomy and mathematics, and in the cycle of books read for natural science are all examined in turn and are complemented by a series of tables.

AB  - The future of science may depend on how education responds to the growing negativism that students and the public show towards science. What is the value of our current teaching methods, if in helping students achieve higher test scores, they also generate a lifelong disdain of science? Achieving a positive attitude towards science must become a major objective of all future teaching methods if we are to reverse the current trend. We can accomplish this by bridging the divide of the Two Cultures that C. P. Snow warned us about, using an innovative method that integrates science with relevant elements from the humanities and the arts. An art gallery can be used effectively as an extension of a science classroom. When properly analyzed, a theater or dance performance, a painting, a novel, a poem, or a film, can enrich and reinforce a science concept beyond traditional lab exercises. When elements of history of science are integrated appropriately in the curriculum, they humanize what is otherwise perceived as a dry, mechanical and impersonal discipline. The author will describe the many benefits and limitations, as well as unexpected discoveries that he has made in his experience with this method.
