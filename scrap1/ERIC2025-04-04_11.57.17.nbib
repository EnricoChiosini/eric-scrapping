AB  - There have been many systematic approaches to solving the problem of how to make science courses interesting to students. One that is currently receiving attention in the sciences is the use of civic engagement within the classroom. This approach works well in small enrollment courses, but it is logistically difficult to implement in large enrollment courses. Large enrollment classes lend themselves more naturally to other civic engagement approaches, such as special topics courses with individual or group research projects. The authors choose to meld the two approaches, thus creating a collection of activity modules for environmental science courses that use a personalized civic engagement model. In this way each student looks at his or her individual impact on society and the environment and researches how to change it. The activity modules they have created seek to engage students on issues vital to the public (climate change, energy, ground-level ozone, etc.). At the conclusion of each module, students calculate just how much they impact their environment or the environment impacts them during the course of their normal day. They then investigate ways that they can change this impact by making changes in their lifestyle.

AB  - This article presents the authors' response to the commentaries on their article. They focus on two important issues raised by most of the reviewers: (a) the curricular dependence of the proposed learning progression and the daunting (twin) challenges of bringing about changes in curriculum and assessment and consolidating and validating the proposed learning progression; and (b) the need for further research and development of a wide variety of sorts. The authors agree that these are major challenges but see them as opportunities as well: opportunities to use research on children's learning to inform curriculum and assessment much more than is currently the case. They argue that although some specific aspects of learning progressions will depend on specific aspects of curricula, which are themselves perhaps a matter of choice and preference, both learning progressions and good curricula are strongly constrained by cognitive and epistemological factors as well. Hence, at a coarse-grained level, there may be fewer truly different paths than might be initially supposed and some general steps in a progression on which all would agree. The authors conclude by underscoring the hypothetical (conjectural) nature of the proposed learning progression, the limitations of the research base that informs it, and the need to do more work that addresses the larger problem of how learning cumulates over a broad sweep of 6 to 8 years.

AB  - The squeeze on instructional time and other factors increasingly leads educators to consider mathematics and science integration in an effort to be more efficient and effective. Unfortunately, the need for common understandings for what it means to integrate these disciplines, as well as the need for improving disciplinary knowledge, appears to continue to be significant obstacles to an integrated approach to instruction. In this study we report the results of a survey containing six instructional scenarios administered to thirty-three middle grades science and math teachers. Analysis of teacher responses revealed that while teachers applied similar criteria in their reasoning, they did not possess common characterizations for integration. Furthermore, analysis suggested that content knowledge serves as a barrier to recognizing integrated examples. Implications for professional development planners include the need to develop and provide teachers with constructs and parameters for what constitutes mathematics and science integration. Continued emphasis on improving teacher content knowledge in both mathematics and science is also a prerequisite to enabling teachers to integrate content.

AB  - This article presents a model for the development of an environmentally oriented unit designed to be implemented as an integral part of the science core curriculum. The program's main goal is encouraging students at the junior high-school level to develop systems-thinking and environmental insight as a basis for environmental literacy. A design-based research was employed in order to construct the learning program and improve it in consecutive cycles. The findings indicate that junior high school students who were involved in the learning process--through knowledge integration activities, scientific inquiry, and outdoor learning--achieved a meaningful improvement of their cyclic and systemic understanding of the water cycle. The article concludes with a summary of the program's design elements we recommend using in other programs seeking to foster students' understanding of natural cycles within the context of their influence on people's daily lives, rather than in the isolation of their specific scientific domains. It is suggested that an environmentally based science curriculum should involve authentic, real environmental topics, and at the same time, it should emphasize the role of scientific knowledge and skills that are needed for the development of environmental literacy.

AB  - City cemeteries are often very old, with gravestones dating back to the early 1800s. Some of the markers are carved out of rocks and may be quite simple, containing only names of the deceased and dates of birth and death; others contain no information at all. This is in sharp contrast to some of the very elaborate markers carved out of granite with intricate designs and embellishments seen today. Learning experiences are important both inside and outside of the classroom. A walking tour of a local  cemetery is an excellent way to allow students the opportunity to connect with the community's past while at the same time providing a successful collaborative curriculum experience with history.

AB  - Interaction between science and design and technology (D&T) in schools is seen by many educationalists and industrialists as being desirable. During the period 1970 to 1990 progress was made in the UK, however the advent of the national curriculum compartmentalised subjects thus hindering further progress. Bodies in the UK such as the Office for Standards in Education (OfSTED) and the Engineering Council have repeatedly promoted cooperation between these two subjects in schools and, since 2000, have renewed their support through several publications. Similar efforts, with varying degrees of success, have been made in other countries. Initially this article records progress made and identifies that, in the majority of cases, a "top-down approach" by educationalists has not produced significant change.This research reports on a "bottom-up", school-based case study facilitated and monitored by university researchers. The findings indicate that this can be fraught with difficulties unless approached in a carefully planned way to avoid situations where teachers challenge each others' subject knowledge and pedagogical culture. The outcome reports on how teachers in the science and design and technology departments of a school achieved a measure of success and concludes with a recommendation of a way forward in facilitating interaction between these two subjects.

AB  - How does one develop and deliver the integrated core of a cross-disciplinary arts and sciences undergraduate degree when the degree program has no departmental or college home and no full-time faculty, but plenty of enthusiastic students who are looking for a unique educational experience? This article outlines how a formalized curriculum assessment process performed a crucial infrastructural role in the development and delivery of a program that falls not only between disciplinary cultures but between the traditional cultures of university administration of faculty assignment, faculty evaluation, and curriculum evolution.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to suggest ways of using research on children's reasoning and learning to elaborate on existing national standards and to improve large-scale and classroom assessments. The authors suggest that "learning progressions"--descriptions of successively more sophisticated ways of reasoning within a content domain based on research syntheses and conceptual analyses--can be useful tools for using research on children's learning to improve assessments. Such learning progressions should be organized around central concepts and principles of a discipline (i.e., its "big ideas") and show how those big ideas are elaborated, interrelated, and transformed with instruction. They should also specify how those big ideas are enacted in specific practices that allow students to use them in meaningful ways, enactments the authors describe as "learning performances". Learning progressions thus can provide a basis for ongoing dialogue between science learning researchers and measurement specialists, leading to the development of assessments that use both standards documents and science learning research as resources and that will give teachers, curriculum developers, and policymakers more insight into students' scientific reasoning. The authors illustrate their argument by developing a learning progression for an important scientific topic--matter and atomic-molecular theory--and using it to generate sample learning performances and assessment items.

AB  - UCLA's Howard Hughes Undergraduate Research Program (HHURP), a collaboration between the College of Letters and Science and the School of Medicine, trains a group of highly motivated undergraduates through mentored research enhanced by a rigorous seminar course. The course is centered on the presentation and critical analysis of scientific journal articles as well as the students' own research. This article describes the components and objectives of the HHURP and discusses the results of three program assessments: annual student evaluations, interviews with UCLA professors who served as research advisors for HHURP scholars, and a survey of program alumni. Students indicate that the program increased their ability to read and present primary scientific research and to present their own research and enhanced their research experience at UCLA. After graduating, they find their involvement in the HHURP helped them in securing admission to the graduate program of their choice and provided them with an advantage over their peers in the interactive seminars that are the foundation of graduate education. On the basis of the assessment of the program from 1998-1999 to 2004-2005, we conclude that an intensive literature-based training program increases student confidence and scientific literacy during their undergraduate years and facilitates their transition to postgraduate study.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether there was a quantifiable improvement in learning outcomes by integrating course materials in a 4-year baccalaureate program, utilizing a knowledge repository with a conceptual map that spans a discipline. Two new models were developed to provide the framework for this knowledge repository. A design artifact, Constructivist Unifying Baccalaureate Epistemology (CUBE), was developed and tested and incorporates these models. This CUBE artifact incorporates a Semantic Web ontology and a W3C Resource Description Framework to create a concept space that offers a unified view of the discipline. The Knowledge Repository was modeled as an organic structure with the ability to evolve over time by incorporating a ranking/voting feature which enables students and faculty to add content to the knowledge base and collectively evaluate the relative weights of conceptual threads. Conceptual Clustering was used to create a concept map for traversing the Knowledge Repository. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the Knowledge Repository, a triangulated research approach was used, which cross checked results with multiple data sources and utilized qualitative and quantitative methods to validate the test instruments. The analyses included: focus groups, semistructured interviews, a questionnaire, and a quantitative exam that measured knowledge spanning multiple courses. Four classes participated during two semesters with four faculty members, using control and treatment groups. The research contrasted conventional single course instruction "versus" an Integrated Knowledge Repository (IKR) approach to learning. There was an average increase of 25 points in scores on a comprehensive exam for students who used the Knowledge Repository. The results supported our main hypothesis, that "Students utilizing the IKR will develop a more complex understanding of the interconnected nature of the materials linking a discipline than those students who take conventional single topic courses".

AB  - Calls for reforms in the ways we teach science at all levels, and in all disciplines, are wide spread. The effectiveness of the changes being called for, employment of student-centered, active learning pedagogy, is now well supported by evidence. The relevant data have come from a number of different disciplines that include the learning sciences, cognitive psychology, and educational psychology. There is a growing body of research within specific scientific teaching communities that supports and validates the new approaches to teaching that have been adopted. These data are reviewed, and their applicability to physiology education is discussed. Some of the inherent limitations of research about teaching and learning are also discussed.

AB  - The aim of the 2018 International Association for Development of the Information Society (IADIS) Cognition and Exploratory Learning in the Digital Age (CELDA) conference was to address the main issues concerned with evolving learning processes and supporting pedagogies and applications in the digital age. There have been advances in both cognitive psychology and computing that have affected the educational arena. The convergence of these two disciplines is increasing at a fast pace and affecting academia and professional practice in many ways. Paradigms such as just-in-time learning, constructivism, student-centered learning and collaborative approaches have emerged and are being supported by technological advancements such as simulations, virtual reality and multi-agent systems. These developments have created both opportunities and areas of serious concerns. This conference aims to cover both technological as well as pedagogical issues related to these developments. Main tracks have been identified. However innovative contributions that do not easily fit into these areas will also be considered as long as they are directly related to the overall theme of the conference -- cognition and exploratory learning in the digital age. The CELDA 2018 Conference received 85 submissions from more than 31 countries. Each submission was reviewed in a double-blind review process by at least two independent reviewers to ensure quality and maintain high standards. Out of the papers submitted, 37 were accepted as full papers, 20 were accepted as short papers, and 5 were accepted as reflection papers. In addition to the presentation of full, short and reflection papers, the conference also includes one keynote presentation from internationally distinguished researcher, Professor Tobias Ley, Professor for Learning Analytics and Educational Innovation, Head of the Center of Excellence in Educational Innovation, Tallinn University, Estonia. Individual papers contain figures, tables, and references. An author index is provided.

AB  - A chemistry teacher describes the elements of the ideal chemistry textbook. The perfect text is focused and helps students draw a coherent whole out of the myriad fragments of information and interpretation. The text would show chemistry as the central science necessary for understanding other sciences and would also root chemistry firmly in the garden of ideas. (PVD)

AB  - Instead of a science fair, the author's intermediate school holds an invention convention. Guided by an Inventor's Log, students must problem solve, think creatively, and budget their time and resources to brainstorm and build an invention. The inventions are built at home, with parental support and supervision. Then, when everyone is ready, the inventors present their work to the class. The entire community is invited to view them during an Invention Gallery Walk held one morning at school. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - Dual degree programmes are becoming increasingly common at universities, especially in the USA. A dual degree programme at the University of Arizona now includes the additional and systematic study of the critical field of entrepreneurship by students studying for dual degree qualifications in business and science or engineering. All participants in the programme undertake formal studies and training in entrepreneurship, leading to the award of a certificate. Thus the programme offers students the opportunity to acquire a regular MBA degree, another Master's degree in a specific domain of science or technology and a certificate in entrepreneurship, all in under two years.

AB  - This report synthesises prominent issues found in the literature related to the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in collaborative learning. It evaluates the most widely employed methodological approaches and reviews the most influential disciplines in the area of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). The purpose of this evaluation is to identify gaps as well as opportunities in current research efforts to guide further investigation into the nature, theory and practice of CSCL. It is argued that there is a genuine need for cross-disciplinary research and a holistic methodological approach which will allow researchers to study technology-enhanced collaborative learning from multiple perspectives. Such an approach should incorporate social, cognitive and technological perspectives towards understanding real--as opposed to experimental--pedagogical contexts. This can help forward-thinking researches, educators, and designers find innovative solutions and practical ideas for addressing the challenges and capitalising the visions of ICT in education.
