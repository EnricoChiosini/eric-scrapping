AB  - Eponymous terms play an important role in STEM education. This research focuses on the current state of Mendeleev eponyms in the context of education and ethnocentrism, addressing their usage in various languages, their educational value, cases of questioned priority and copyright violation in Mendeleev major eponyms--periodic table and periodic system. 106 chemistry textbooks in 4 languages including Soviet-time and current Russian textbooks were perused to identify and trace Mendeleev eponyms over 1924-2016. Advanced Google Search with queries in Belarusian, English, Latvian, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian was conducted to evaluate online presence of eponyms "Mendeleev periodic table" and "Mendeleev periodic system." It was found that while Mendeleev eponyms occur generously on the Internet, periodic table and system with Mendeleev's name attached are seldom used on non-Russian webpages. Most Mendeleev eponyms were made up in the USSR and remain popular and Russia, which can be explained within the framework of ethnocentrism as a ruling tendency. Recognizing Mendeleev's priority, Flinn and Ross's periodic systems can be considered plagiarized; a few factors might favor their emergence, but ethnocentrism is unlikely to be one of them. Mendeleev eponyms remain valuable assets for science education, acting as shortcuts to the history of science and actualizing interdisciplinary connections. [For the full proceedings, see ED629086.]

AB  - Growing interest in interdisciplinary (ID) understanding has led to the recent development of four ID assessments, none of which have previously been comprehensively validated. Sources of evidence for the validity of tests include construct validity, such as the internal structure of the test. ID tests may (and should) test both disciplinary (D) and ID understanding, and the internal structure can be examined to determine whether the theoretical relationship among D and ID knowledge is supported by empirical evidence. In this paper, we present an analysis of internal structure of ISACC, an ID assessment of carbon cycling, selected because the developers included both disciplinary and ID items and posited a relationship among these two types of knowledge. Responses from 454 high school and college students were analyzed using confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) with the Mplus software for internal structure focusing on dimensionality, as well as functioning by gender and race/ethnicity, and reliability. CFA confirmed that the underlying structure of the ISACC best matches a two-factor path model, supporting the developers' theoretical hypothesis of the impact of disciplinary understanding on interdisciplinary understanding. No gender effect was found in the factor structure of the ISACC, indicating that females and males have similar performance. Race/ethnicity performance was similar to other science assessments, revealing possible ethnicity bias on the part of the instrument. The reliability coefficients for the two-factor path model were found to be sufficient. This study highlights the importance of the internal structure of test instruments as a source of validity evidence and models a procedure to assess internal structure.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence is widely used across contexts and for different purposes, including the field of education. However, a review of the literature showcases that while there exist various review studies on the use of AI in education, missing remains a review focusing on science education. To address this gap, we carried out a systematic literature review between 2010 and 2021, driven by three questions: a) What types of AI applications are used in school science? b) For what teaching content are AI applications in school science used? and, c) What is the impact of AI applications on teaching and learning of school science? The studies reviewed (n = 22) included nine different types of AI applications: automated assessment, automated feedback, learning analytics, adaptive learning systems, intelligent tutoring systems, multilabel text classification, chatbot, expert systems, and mind wandering detection. The majority of the AI applications are used in geoscience or physics and AI applications are used to support either knowledge construction or skills development. In terms of the impact of AI applications, this is found across the following: learning achievement, argumentation skills, learning experience, and teaching. Missing remains an examination of learners' and teachers' experiences with the use of AI in school science, interdisciplinary approaches to AI implementation, as well as an examination of issues related to ethics and biases.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is increasingly acknowledged as an essential skill to solve problems interdisciplinary. This paper describes the development and validation of the unplugged activity of CT in science (ACTS) module, which is specifically designed to integrate CT. The present study was conducted in five phases: Phase I was composed of needs analysis to elicit respondents' opinions regarding the knowledge of CT and appropriate topic to integrate CT within the year 5 science curriculum. Phase II was the development of the unplugged ACTS module, Phase III was content and face validation of the module, Phase IV was the implementation and Phase V was the evaluation of the effectiveness of the module. The needs assessment indicated that students have never known about CT. The module covered the "Matter" topic for year 5. A content validity index (CVI) was used to quantitatively assess content validity, finding a CVI of more than 0.79 as appropriate. The module was found to have a high mean of validity for content value (CVI=0.83). Expert members have made suggestions that will then be used to develop the module as required. This study concluded that the module has strong validity of the content and can be used to improve CT and science content knowledge among children in primary school.

AB  - The presented research focused on developing and testing an innovative interdisciplinary STEM didactic model. The developed didactic model was introduced in the field of eco-farming. To the participants, it offers the possibility for non-formal training, which can take place anywhere and anytime. Participants require some knowledge of STEM subjects (especially chemistry and biology) as well as knowledge of ecology, technology, and engineering, in order to provide answers and solutions to environmental challenges while using knowledge of mathematics (especially combinatorics and statistics) to search for optimal solutions (in our case, a lean business plan). The model was tested in non-formal education settings, based on an interdisciplinary approach and modern technologies, such as monitoring the effectiveness of training using electroencephalography (EEG) and mobile applications. In the presented didactic model, special emphasis was placed on an interdisciplinary STEM approach to environmental protection, ecology, connatural forms of production and sustainable development. The presented research confirms the hypotheses that non-formal education is becoming an increasingly important form of education and training, and that the use of the interdisciplinary didactic model, contemporary technologies, and mobile applications, increases the time and intensity of concentration in learning and thus improves learning effectiveness.

AB  - Current environmental problems are the primary focus for environmental science students and researchers. Sustainable environmental solutions require interdisciplinary thought processes, which pose difficulty to both students and the public. Computational thinking is an emerging term emphasized by progressive science curricula. Computational thinking and environmental science are both interdisciplinary by nature. Learning about sustainable environmental solutions requires students to partake in computational thinking. These ideas lend toward an expansive learning progression that encourages scaffolded and differentiated student progress in both computational knowledge and environmental knowledge. The learning progression, which emerges from the conceptual framework, emphasizes the spheres of sustainability, research, education, and economic perspectives to support environmental science learning through computational thinking. Computational thinking emphasized by the computational components (input, integration, output, and feedback) support learning about environmental solutions within the learning progression. The learning progression promotes application and implications for educators, students, researchers, and environmental scientists.

AB  - This paper takes an institutional perspective on the topic of sustainability in order to analyse how this "idea" enters science teacher education through an interdisciplinary approach. It shows how the development and implementation of a course for Danish pre-service teachers was conditioned and constrained by a complex web of interactions in and among the teaching disciplines of biology, geography and physics/chemistry and among the institutions of school, teacher college and university. The data collected are used to identify influences among the disciplines as well as disciplinary differences, conceptualised through a new reference model that separates the analysis from the usual sustainability dimensions. The findings reveal how sustainability as a teaching topic can be a unifying idea in an interdisciplinary setting. Disciplinary differences evidently impact course planning and implementation significantly, but not exclusively. By elaborating on the interactions between these circumstances, the paper provides insight into the processes of developing interdisciplinary teacher education.

AB  - Interdisciplinary teaching in STEM is often seen as a collaboration of different subjects teaching a common theme. This view undermines successful interdisciplinary approaches that can be deployed in a single class. Two examples of interdisciplinary math lessons, using pie charts and bar charts respectively, will be used to demonstrate how this can be realized. The potential for deeper integration among the subjects involved will also be analyzed.

AB  - Microfabrication is a critical area to many branches of science and engineering. However, to many students accustomed to seeing transistors as things that come in a lab kit, it is an obscure subtopic of their discipline. Beginning in 2009, the authors undertook a broad multidisciplinary approach to bring microfabrication into all aspects of the Binghamton University science and engineering curriculum. This program was coupled with a comprehensive assessment activity to evaluate the program's effectiveness and continuously improve it year by year. This paper reports the details of the implementation process, the techniques that were found to bring a hands-on experience to large classes, and the lessons learned from the assessments of this program to make this topic a mainstream part of engineering and science education.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this paper is to provide a historical overview of studies on generalisation in mathematics education for future research. Because, generalisation is one of the most important mathematical thinking processes and the essence of mathematics. Thus, there are many studies related with generalisation. Method: This study is survey article. Our hypothetical theoretical framework is "whose generalisation becomes the object of each study" and "where is the position of the researcher and his/her object(s) of analysis (that is, someone who is generalising)". Findings: Considering this framework, we propose the following four periods: "human generalisation in mathematics," "human generalisation in mathematics education," "students' generalisation in mathematics education," and "learners' generalisation in education and/or interdisciplinarity." Significance: There are various studies that is related with generalisation in discipline of mathematics education. To regard with its long history and tradition, sometimes it makes our perplexity when we want to investigate students' generalisation; because, their methodology, background theory, focus and so on are very different from each other.

AB  - The study explored the effects of an interdisciplinary learning approach on developing students' English learning (EL) and computational thinking (CT) through two different game-based learning approaches. A quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in terms of enhancing students' CT knowledge and their EL achievement in an elementary school English as a foreign language learning context. A total of 52 Grade 3 students took part in the experiment, of whom 28 assigned to the experimental group learned with a machine educational robot (machine-ER) board game and 24 assigned to the control group learned with a character educational robot (character-ER) board game. The results indicated that both groups made significant improvements in learning achievement: 1) in EL achievement of learning vocabulary and sentence patterns; 2) in CT concepts, although the machine-ER board game produced a greater increase than the character-ER board game in both language learning achievement and CT knowledge; 3) their learning anxieties were also lower than those of the control group; and 4) the analysis of behavioral patterns also revealed that students playing the machine-ER board game demonstrated better language-learning interaction, while the character-ER board game presented greater CT development in finding solutions.

AB  - Due to the increasing presence of the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education paradigm in Spain, many teachers have embarked on the design of specific Teaching--Learning Sequences (TLS) to be implemented in schools. Understanding the views and perceptions about STEM that take shape in specific teachers' designs should enrich the way in which STEM education is designed based on a more focused approach. This study aims to characterise how secondary school teachers from Catalonia (Spain) design STEM TLS, to identify specific design profiles that can be related to different understandings of STEM education based on a mixed-method analytical approach. We collected 345 canvases from teachers participating in a national STEM education training programme, outlining STEM TLS. The canvases were analysed with an assessment rubric consisting of 8 instructional components (Interdisciplinarity, STEM practices, Information and Communications Technology tools, Formalisation, Openness, Alignment, Authenticity and Values). We identified patterns in teachers' designs while implementing a hierarchical cluster analysis of the results, obtaining 6 different clusters of 39, 36, 66, 49, 90, and 65 TLS, respectively. The diverse components prioritised or balanced in each cluster suggest how STEM education can be conceived of differently by participating teachers through the lens of component analysis. While authenticity appears to be a major force in the clustering process, direct relationships between components can be found (i.e., between Formalisation and Alignment), as well as inverse relationships (i.e., between Openness and Practices). These findings provide important clues to understand STEM TLS design and recognise the rubric and the cluster definition as powerful tools for teacher training and evaluation in STEM education.

AB  - Numerous case studies suggest that integrating art and science education could engage students with creative projects and encourage students to express science in multitude of ways. However, little is known about art integration practices in everyday science teaching. With a qualitative e-survey, this study explores the art integration of science teachers (n = 66). A pedagogical model for science teachers' art integration emerged from a qualitative content analysis conducted on examples of art integration. In the model, art integration is characterised as integration through content and activities. Whilst the links in the content were facilitated either directly between concepts and ideas or indirectly through themes or artefacts, the integration through activity often connected an activity in one domain and a concept, idea or artefact in the other domain with the exception of some activities that could belong to both domains. Moreover, the examples of art integration in everyday classroom did not include expression of emotions often associated with art. In addition, quantitative part of the survey confirmed that integration is infrequent in all mapped areas. The findings of this study have implications for science teacher education that should offer opportunities for more consistent art integration.

AB  - In the last decade, the term STEM has been increasingly picked up internationally and come to represent a solution to a range of issues. Within education, STEM is being translated as a curriculum organiser that has the possibility of engaging and retaining students and is interdisciplinary and skills focussed. This paper takes the STEM curriculum as its focus and investigates the influences that have resulted in the current interpretation of STEM as well as the epistemological questions, tensions and issues that this curriculum raises. The paper does this through a consideration of previous and current curriculum movements and debates and in doing so raises questions about the underlying assumptions, form and focus that STEM curriculum take before considering some possible future directions.

AB  - In this article, we present the first results of the project OPEN-MATH. The research project aims at acknowledging the need for learning environments with differentiation strategies for all. We developed a model for inclusive mathematics learning, based on the Theory of Objectification and a broad idea of differentiation realized through Open Learning. It poses an interdisciplinary research issue that requires the collaboration of two sub-disciplines pertaining to the area of educational studies: Inclusive Education and Mathematics Education. The results we present here are related to the dialogue between theory and practice, whose outcome is a teaching and learning model for inclusion in mathematics. The construction of the teaching and learning model moves along two complementary paths: (1) concerning the theoretical point of view, we implemented connecting theory strategies to network Open Education and the Theory of Objectification; and (2) concerning the methodological point of view, we implemented Educational Design Research. The new teaching-learning model is the result of theoretical and methodological validation in real contexts according to an interdisciplinary approach. This study shows the strengths of interdisciplinary research for the pursuit of inclusive mathematics and high standards of learning.

AB  - Children can see the Moon with the naked eye and often are curious about the Moon and other objects in the sky, like the Sun and the stars. However, there is sometimes disagreement in early childhood about whether studying space is appropriate for young children. This activities described in this article engaged children who had different learning preferences. Some children adored a creative make-your-own constellation, while others were drawn to a crater science investigation. In this article, the authors introduce a space science study--starting with how children's interests were at the core--outlining interdisciplinary links and including a detailed description of the making Moon craters activity. This study of space took place in a prekindergarten classroom with children ranging from 3 to 5 years of age, but could easily be adapted for older children. The lessons were part of a thematic unit on outer space that developed after the class had learned about weather.

AB  - St. Lawrence University received a five-year Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to create the multidisciplinary Liberal Arts Science Scholars program (award #1458712), which makes a high quality science and mathematics education accessible to high achieving, Pell Grant eligible students by providing merit scholarships and specialized supports. The program's supports, which are not specific to any one discipline, are designed to combat three of the main barriers to STEM persistence: capacity, interest, and belonging. This paper describes the first year of the Liberal Arts Science Scholars program and provides preliminary evidence for the program's ability to serve as a model for improving the retention and academic success of low-income students in the natural, physical, and mathematical sciences. While the Liberal Arts Science Scholars Program was implemented at a small, private liberal arts university, the supports described could be adapted for use at any type of institution.

AB  - Entrepreneurship brings several benefits, such as fostering innovation and productivity, competitiveness, and socioeconomic development. The search for professionals with different skills to overcome the current and foreseen challenges is relevant in the agri-food sector. Problem-based learning (PBL) is described as an instructional approach, which promotes interdisciplinarity and critical thinking, with the potential to meet current challenges. This article describes how PBL, aligned with an innovation program and contest, has been integrated into a master's degree in food engineering to promote academic entrepreneurship. The alignment of the PBL with the program and contest allowed the development of innovative products with a view to solving problems faced by the agri-food sector. The PBL strategy allowed students to mobilize knowledge from several curricular units of food studies for the development of different deliverables to participate in the innovation program and contest. This participation allowed students, supported by business mentors, to demonstrate their products to stakeholders. This way, it was possible to promote innovation in the agri-food sector, stimulating the entrepreneurial spirit among higher education students, and understand its potential for replication and mobilization of skills acquired in different food study courses.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the perceptions of classroom teacher candidates towards the concept and teaching of social sciences through metaphors. In the 2018-2019 academic year, the Department of primary education of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Lefke European University, Faculty of Education 1., 2., 3. and 4. there are 119 candidates of teachers who study in the classroom. Phenomenology design, one of the qualitative research methods, was used in the study. The data of the study was obtained through a semi-structured interview form. Content analysis technique was used in the analysis of the data. In this context, he produced 61 metaphors aimed at the concept of social sciences by participants. The metaphors produced were collected under 4 different conceptual categories. The metaphors produced by the class teacher candidates for the concept of social sciences were collected in 4 categories, "social-vital, interdisciplinary, cultural resource and primary education" respectively. The number of metaphors (f=27) in the "social-vital" category is greater when the metaphors developed by the teacher candidates according to the categories created for the concept of social sciences are taken into account. The most repeated in this category has been the metaphor of life (f=20). The classroom teacher candidates produced 69 metaphors for teaching social sciences. The metaphors developed for the teaching of social sciences in line with the explanations made by the participants were grouped into 4 categories: "meeting social needs, interdisciplinary, knowledge transfer, cultural transfer," "When the metaphors developed by the teacher candidates according to the categories are taken into consideration, it is observed that the number of metaphors (f=31) in the "meeting the social needs" category for social sciences teaching is higher. The most repeated teaching of values in this category has been the metaphor (f=8).

AB  - Reforming instruction is challenging. In this comparative case study of 12 school districts, we investigated the dilemmas that emerged for system leaders as they engaged in system building for elementary science and the approaches leaders took in managing them. We found that system leaders' efforts to manage their environments contributed to the preferential treatment of literacy and mathematics relative to science. Leaders managed this dilemma using three strategies: (a) integration of science with other subjects, (b) specialization of teachers, and (c) adopting curriculum materials. This study contributes to literature on dilemma management by showing that dilemmas in education system building are school-subject sensitive, emerge in relation to system building for other subjects, and are embedded in school and education systems' structural/organizational arrangements.

AB  - The 360 Degree Global Education Model (360 Global Ed Model) provides a comprehensive framework for creating meaningful interdisciplinary student team learning through international service learning. Providing successful multi-disciplined undergraduate education necessitates creating a foundation for productive team-science based learning between disciplines. The pedagogical foundation employed by Breitkreuz and Songer within the 360 Global Ed model creates a shared values student dialogue for enhancing undergraduate team learning and performance. This paper provides a summary of the 360 Global Ed Model, a discussion of methods used to create a student shared dialogue ("Team Learning Foundation"), lessons learned, and student outcomes. Methods for shared dialogues include creating a team-defined mission, team-defined behavioral standards, building shared cultural understandings and expectations for developing cultural intelligence, and developing realistic expectations for interpersonal understandings through use of self-assessments. Student team-led projects provide an authentic context impetus for implementing the team learning foundation. [For the full proceedings, see ED631133.]

AB  - Resilience is understood as interactive processes that strengthen the individual and the family in the face of the demands of adversity or vulnerable situation. Resilience is fostered from a psychopedagogical approach when practices are developed that assist in facing challenges positively, having life projects and developing academic potentialities. Thus, the objective of this systematic review of the literature is cartography programs that promote resilience in children, adolescents, or youths who are facing a challenging condition, such as a disease or disability. The PRISMA declaration was used to guide this systematic search. The databases consulted were Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCOhost, ERIC and Dialnet Plus. Open access articles were selected between 2016 and 2021. The selection resulted in 15 educational programs. The results indicate that there are several models for building resilience, such as ecosystem, family, community, and academic models. In conclusion, interdisciplinarity is a cross-cutting axis for enhancing resilience in vulnerable settings.

AB  - A science, technology, society, and environmental (STSE) impact assignment framework was developed that bridges the gap between analytical chemistry education and broader societal and environmental contexts. Over the course of [approximately]8 weeks, students were provided with the opportunity to engage in a self-directed learning opportunity to explore an instrumental analytical technique of interest for the analysis of a sample of choice. The assignment, which could be completed as a written report or video presentation, had students investigate not only the scientific principles behind the analytical technique they selected but also the societal implications of their application and potential environmental repercussions. By delving into these broader, multidisciplinary considerations, students were encouraged to think critically, make informed decisions, and recognize the ethical and environmental responsibilities that accompany ongoing developments associated with technological innovation (and instrumental analytical chemistry, in particular).

AB  - Purpose: Approaches to solving sustainability problems require a specific problem-solving mode, encompassing the complexity, fuzziness and interdisciplinary nature of the problem. This paper aims to promote a complex systems' view of addressing sustainability problems, in particular through the tool of network science, and provides an outline of an interdisciplinary training workshop. Design/methodology/approach: The topic of the workshop is the analysis of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a political action plan. The authors are interested in the synergies and trade-offs between the goals, which are investigated through the structure of the underlying network. The authors use a teaching approach aligned with sustainable education and transformative learning. Findings: Methodologies from network science are experienced as valuable tools to familiarise students with complexity and to handle the proposed case study. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work which uses network terminology and approaches to teach sustainability problems. This work highlights the potential of network science in sustainability education and contributes to accessible material.

AB  - 'A lack of prior knowledge in the other discipline' is often given by geoscience instructors to explain why students struggle to apply knowledge from other disciplines to the Earth. We examine this assumption by considering the disciplinary crossing of buoyancy (physics) to isostasy (geoscience). We investigate the teachers' perspective through workshops, and use the theoretical framework of Interdisciplinary Reasoning and Communication to explore what geoscience textbooks ask of students. Most introductory textbooks rely on students applying pre-existing knowledge of hydrostatics in a geoscience context ("forwards transfer"), while intermediate and advanced textbooks develop the necessary physics explicitly in a geoscientific context ("backwards transfer"). Moreover, introductory textbooks frequently use analogies for "concrete translation" between physics and geoscience ideas, but the analogical relations and where they break down ("relational translations"), receive little attention. This places high demands on students' prior understanding of hydrostatics to successfully integrate and transfer knowledge from physics to geoscience. If students lack the relevant physics background, introductory textbooks may force them to rely on intuitive ideas of physics, potentially reinforcing old, and giving rise to new misconceptions. Our results move the focus from perceived shortcomings of students to the demands made on them in interdisciplinary learning.

AB  - The paper reports about the outcome of a systematic review of research on family resemblance approach (FRA) to nature of science in (NOS) science education. FRA is a relatively recent perspective on NOS being a system of cognitive-epistemic and social-institutional aspects of science. FRA thus consists of a set of categories such as aims and values, practices, knowledge and social organizations in relation to NOS. Since the introduction of the FRA, there has been increasing interest in investigations about how FRA can be of use in science education both empirically and practically. A journal content analysis was conducted in order to investigate which FRA categories are covered in journal articles and to identify the characteristics of the studies that have used FRA. These characteristics included the target level of education and focus on pre- or in-service teachers. Furthermore, epistemic network analysis of theoretical and empirical papers was conducted to determine the extent to which the studies incorporated various key themes about FRA, such as its transferability to other domains and differentiation of the social-institutional system categories. The findings illustrate an increasing number of empirical studies using FRA in recent years and broad coverage in science education. Although the social-institutional system categories included intraconnections, these were not as strong as those intraconnections among categories within the cognitive-epistemic system. Future research directions for the use of FRA in K-12 science education are discussed.

AB  - Background: We examine the development of youth sociopolitical consciousness and agency in an eighth-grade science classroom as students of color engage in critical speculative design activities, exploring the multi-scalar, racial realities and possibilities of the science and engineering of pervasive digital technologies--specifically involving the entanglement of lightwaves and melanin in computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Methods: Through case studies of two girls of color (ES and GS), we analyze the youths' learning pathways across three instructional phases: threading practices (learners' sociopolitical interpretation); weaving practices (learners' coordination of multiple ways of knowing and being in relation to their interpretation); and patternmaking practices (learners' visions of more just patterns, practices, and politics through speculative design). Findings: Our analyses show how youth use their felt, cultural, and community knowledges, as well as their developing scientific knowledge of physics, to confront and analyze manifestations of racial bias in technologies. The findings highlight the significance of teachers' pedagogical support and providing opportunities for meaningful transdisciplinary science investigations and speculative designing for more just and thriving futures. Contribution: The Critical Speculative Design Pedagogy framework developed suggests how such activities in the classroom can cultivate equitable, expansive science learning that is consequential to youth and their communities.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to evaluate the current situation of education for sustainable development, climate change education and environmental education in a nationwide context. Methodologically, this study calls for more research to go beyond case studies and take a similar approach to examine university curricula and facilitate cross-country comparisons. Design/methodology/approach: This paper examines the status of climate and sustainability curricula in Taiwan's higher education system. Using the course catalog for the 2020-2021 academic year, the authors constructed a unique data set that includes 1,827 courses at 29 major universities in Taiwan. In each institution, the authors search for course titles that include "climate," "sustainable/sustainability" and "environment/environmental" as keywords and code the courses according to their disciplines. Findings: The finding highlights the variations across institutional types and subject matters. Public universities have an average of 4.94 related courses per 1,000 students, whereas private universities have only 3.13. In general, the relevant courses are more concentrated in the STEM and bioscience fields. The curricula, however, are seriously constrained by the disciplinary structure and foster few transdisciplinary perspectives. Originality/value: The authors seek to go beyond case studies and offer one of the most comprehensive curricula samples at the national level. Taiwan adds an important data point, as the current literature focuses heavily on the USA and Europe.

AB  - A pilot test for the design and construction of digital lessons for integrated social science teaching is presented in this study. Combing conventional texts, applications made with Google Earth, and images from the web, three lessons for the sixth grade were created: (1) Evolution of Man, (2) Physical Geography of the Earth, and (3) Pre-Columbian America. Interactive workshops were held with a group of 60 teachers from the city of Montería, Colombia, to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that allowed for the construction of a SWOT matrix. SWOT analysis allowed for the identification of educational limitations in Montería resulting from limited classroom access to computers and the internet and the insufficient teacher knowledge regarding information technology and geotechnologies. This analysis also allowed for the identification of guidelines for the development of digital lessons. These lessons serve as a methodological proposal for teaching social science, promoting the integration of such topics as geography, history, and environmental science. This integrative method motivated the teachers, who believed that it could be a path to true integration of the social sciences.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to share worked examples of skills profiling within the universal micro-credential framework, a novel approach designed to further the enablement of 21st century skills which are defined here as a generalized series of competencies gained by a learner that enable them to self-reflect, self-regulate and self-optimize their capabilities within highly emergent contexts. This approach improves interdisciplinary learning and assessment paths for computing education by providing personalized learning and assessment options and by enabling curricula to better accommodate both internal and external interdisciplinary content. Through these worked examples, this article addresses potential solutions to fundamental and persistent structural issues in today's learning-earning ecosystem. Most significant of these issues is what the authors refer to as a "capability-competency chasm," a term used to describe an enduring gap that creates problematic deficits for learners as they transition between education and employment. At the core of the universal micro-credential framework is skills profiling, which can leverage micro-credential pathways and badge catalogues, both within the context of computing education in particular and across higher education in general. Accounting for the complexity of implementing system-wide redesign in highly variable higher-education contexts, this article also briefly references the role of design patterns to enable such implementation. Collectively, these flexible credentialing innovations offer a globally innovative solution to systemic challenges, explaining both the importance of addressing such challenges and the opportunities arising from them.

AB  - Though we live in a 4-dimensional universe, our minds and bodies are not particularly good at perceiving and depicting 4 dimensions. This study contributes to our understanding of collaboration with abstract concepts by examining particular activities where bodily and experiential understandings may conflict with the conceptual domain. Specifically, upper secondary physics classrooms studying Einstein's general theory of relativity are taken as a setting to identify the representational practices and conceptual challenges that arise when learners attempt to make meaning with, and express conflicting notions of, space and time. To unpack these challenges, we draw on the concept of imagination and on theoretical perspectives that treat imagining as a social activity. We also present the concept of metaimagining to characterize layered processes in which learners attend to and manage shifts between their own imaginative activities. This concept is illustrated through a detailed analysis of an extended conversation between 2 upper secondary physics students working with general relativity and spacetime. The students perform a diverse set of imaginative activities that are strongly tied to communicative, cognitive, and bodily action. We also show how the unique domain of general relativity presents particular challenges to student meaning making of abstract concepts which in turn prompt metaimagining. Based on our analysis, we offer recommendations to improve instructional practices in general relativity and argue for the consideration of imagining as a transdisciplinary competency in math and science education.

AB  - In order to fully appreciate the interdisciplinary nature of energy resources, there is a need to understand pertinent issues from other viewpoints besides a purely chemistry perspective. In this paper, the teaching of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and business databases as part of CM4282: Energy Resources at the Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore (NUS), is described. For teaching of CBA, in two 1h sessions, topics such as net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), discount rate, payback period, and sensitivity analysis were introduced in the context of capital budgeting. With collaboration from NUS libraries, in another 1h session, students were instructed on searching business databases for conducting strength, weakness, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis as part of their end-of-semester group presentation. Exposure to CBA and business databases enables chemistry majors in CM4282 to understand energy resources in an interdisciplinary light and enables the application of classroom knowledge to real-life scenarios in energy resources.

AB  - This study is a two-iteration design-based research project that investigated how youths' science learning and socio-emotional attitudes toward science were influenced by a summer camp with a personal genetics approach. A multidisciplinary team developed a 2-week camp curriculum that included personal DNA tests, family genealogy projects, and fitness tracker data. The learners included 120 youths, aged 10-14, in six camps held in three sites. Data collection included matched pre- and post-scores for genetic knowledge and self-reported affiliation with science, views of science supports, self-efficacy, and science curiosity scores, as well as youths' daily workbook entries. Our analysis included t-tests, Mann-Whitney tests, Pearson and Spearman correlations, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc tests. The findings showed significant science learning gains (related to heredity, genotype, and phenotype) for five of six camp conditions. Also, the youths showed gains in socio-emotional attitudes for both iterations, emphasizing malleability of socio-emotional connections to science. Completing workbook pages was not associated with an increase in knowledge gains or socio-emotional attitudes. This study recommends the inclusion of personal DNA data in summer camp environments to support science learning and increase socio-emotional attitudes toward science. It also suggests structured workbook activities common in schools may not support youths' science learning or socio-emotional attitudes in out-of-school programs. Finally, the study's concluding design conjecture map connects the camps' activities to learners' behaviors to learning outcomes in a way that advances the informal science education field's use of personal data in out-of-school-time programs for adolescents.

AB  - There have been calls for Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education to become more interdisciplinary, reflecting the reality of contemporary research. However, communicating across disciplines is challenging. In this article, I explore what and how students read in the STEM disciplines. I provide an overview of key topics in literacy research, and discuss the disciplinary nature of literacy. I compare disciplinary literacy requirements in STEM through thematic analysis of UK quality subject benchmark statements, which identifies considerable variation in the expectations of undergraduates to engage with primary research literature. I explore implications this has for interdisciplinary teaching, and present some published pedagogical strategies for engaging students in research literature. I call on STEM educators to embed inclusive disciplinary literacy teaching within curricula to support students in their reading. I also highlight the need for clear understanding of disciplinary conventions and reading expectations when designing interdisciplinary educational programmes.

AB  - For well over a century, the journal "Science Education" has been publishing articles about the teaching and learning of science. These articles represent more than just a repository of past work: they have the potential to offer insights into both the history of science education as well as well as the dynamics of field-specific change. It can be difficult, however, for educators, researchers, reformers, and policymakers to grasp the nuances of over 100 years of scholarship given the overwhelming amount of textual material. To address this problem, we have used latent Dirichlet allocation, an automated machine-learning algorithm from the field of natural language processing, to perform an automated literature review and classification of the corpus of work in "Science Education." Using this technique, we have classified research in the journal into 21 distinct topics, falling into three thematic groups: science content topics, teaching-focused topics, and student-focused topics. We have also quantified the rise and fall of these topics and groups over time, and used them to begin to extract insight into the development of the field, including the effects of national policy changes on topics of interest to the research community, the interrelationships between different research topics, and the effects of intellectual cross-pollination. Based on this analysis, we argue that this technique shows great promise for even larger-scale analyses of educational literature and other textual data.

AB  - Innovation and entrepreneurship education develop rapidly in China, but the teaching varies considerably in quality. Therefore, it is very important to systematically construct an evaluation index system of innovation and entrepreneurship education. The specialty setting of comprehensive universities has the characteristics of interdisciplinary. The research selected the Shenzhen Campus of Jinan University as a case study. Based on literature research, the research constructed an evaluation index system of innovation and entrepreneurship education for undergraduate students majoring in interdisciplinary arts and sciences, which is composed of 4 primary indexes and 19 secondary indexes. In total, 234 respondents were surveyed and Importance-performance Analysis modelling was performed to analyze the innovation and entrepreneurship education situation of the research object. Results show that the most important evaluation index to be improved is the innovative service platform. The findings of this study would be of use to the development of innovation and entrepreneurship education in other similar universities.

AB  - Out-of-school science education institutions, such as museums, science centres, zoos and aquaria, have strong potentials to promote sustainability, yet seem to lack an operational definition of sustainability that aligns with their specific characteristics and institutional remit. Here, we use the anthropological theory of didactics to systematically develop such an operational definition, designated as the reference model. We draw on literature from research and practice to account for the features of sustainability science and policy, as well as the different specific strengths of out-of-school science education institutions, to identify unique potentials for sustainability education. These potentials are synthesised and illustrated in a set of institutionally specific guidelines that optimise the organisation of sustainability for each kind of out-of-school science education institution. We conclude by considering the implications of our findings for sustainability education.

AB  - Despite psychology's position within the National Council for the Social Studies' definition of social studies, the American Psychological Association is advocating the rebranding of psychology as a science course. This study interviews six high school psychology teachers and employs a Foucauldian framework to understand different perspectives on this rebranding, what makes teachers position their psychology course as science or social studies, and how that rebranding has impacted teachers' perceived ability to make psychology content relevant to students' lived experiences. We find significant disagreement among psychology teachers about the degree to which they should embrace the "psychology-as-science" paradigm. We also find that most professional development for high school psychology teachers is rooted in the science paradigm and that many teachers feel limited by their ability to connect psychology content to students' lived experiences under the science paradigm. We conclude with recommendations for teachers, curriculum leaders, researchers, and teacher preparation programs for upholding psychology as an interdisciplinary social studies course.

AB  - The food-energy-water (FEW) nexus framework calls for a systems perspective on addressing complex sustainability challenges. As a sustainability science field, nexus research should in theory bring together transdisciplinary approaches drawing from a range of stakeholder knowledge and experiences. This approach would align with the competence-based training for future sustainability leaders advocated for in sustainability education literature. In practice, the field is dominated by techno-scientific approaches with superficial or peripheral attention paid to issues of social justice and community engagement. In this article, we explore how this imbalance in the literature reflects a breakdown between the ideals of sustainability training and the reality of training at the nexus and describe obstacles that may be contributing to this breakdown, including a prejudice towards the idea of "objective" science, institutional incentives, and disciplinary culture. To address these concerns, we introduce a research project focused on assessing the training of future researchers at the FEW nexus and exploring how these programs train students in particular views of what is important at the FEW nexus, such as technological solutions, stakeholder collaboration, and/or issues of equity and justice. It will also provide recommendations for creating open learning environments that are competence-based, and that incorporate multiple methods, acknowledgments of limitations, and alternate ways of knowing.

AB  - The relevance of the researched problem is caused by the increasing interest in using potential of transdisciplinary approaches, and mathematical methods, which include the game theory in analysis of public and economic processes. The aim of the article is studying a possibility of implementation of the transdisciplinary approaches in economic researches. The leading approach is institutional and evolutionary, which allows to reveal such tendencies of relationship development and interrelations of individuals that remain hidden and implicit. It also allows to receive new and quite unexpected important results, significant for practice. In the article the hypothesis is proved. According to it, innovations, its generation and autopoiesis itself are structural units. In the innovative environment it assumes various forms. The materials of the article can be useful for development of the theory of the system analysis, and also when developing macroeconomic forecasts of social and economic development.

AB  - According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015 measurements, Slovak primary school pupils commonly can reach some below average scores in terms of scientific literacy and have less and less positive attitudes towards the natural sciences. Natural sciences and statistics are intertwined disciplines. This implies that there is a room for teachers to try using interdisciplinarity and including basic statistics in the laboratory lessons of natural sciences. The aim of this research paper is to identify the difficulties that can occur when primary pupils collect and process data during a practical research task, combining, here, the knowledge stemming from the natural sciences and statistical reasoning. The research sample consisted of nine primary pupils from grade 1 to grade 4; the average age was 9.44 ± 1.33 years. Pupils were divided into the three age heterogeneous groups who were assigned a laboratory exam. The data were collected via an unstructured participatory observation. The results of our analysis of verbal expressions and practical activities suggest that pupils in our research sample are in the range of levels of nonformal and inconsistent understanding of statistics. In addition, we observed here some characteristics of consistent noncritical understanding. These findings suggest that, with the proper stimulation and frequent research activities requiring the direct activity and involvement of pupils, they could achieve higher levels of statistical literacy as well.

AB  - Students need to think and work across disciplinary boundaries in the twenty-first century. However, it is unclear what interdisciplinary thinking means and how to analyze interdisciplinary interactions in teamwork. In this paper, drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives and empirical analysis of discourse contents, we formulate a theoretical framework that helps analyze interdisciplinary reasoning and communication (IRC) processes in interdisciplinary collaboration. Specifically, we propose four interrelated IRC processes--"integration," "translation," "transfer," and "transformation," and develop a corresponding analytic framework. We apply the framework to analyze two meetings of a project that aims to develop interdisciplinary science assessment items. The results illustrate that the framework can help interpret the interdisciplinary meeting dynamics and patterns. Our coding process and results also suggest that these IRC processes can be further examined in terms of interconnected sub-processes. We also discuss the implications of using the framework in conceptualizing, practicing, and researching interdisciplinary learning and teaching in science education.

AB  - Landscapes have been and are an important aspect of any society, culture, economy and environment. Besides the role of landscape and Landscape Sciences in these arenas, there have been increasingly greater calls to incorporate landscape into the curriculum. Moreover, Landscape Education is beneficial in developing important foundations in students, particularly that of active citizenry. While the benefits of Landscape Education are evident, current research remains focused on Western, especially European, contexts. This article discusses how a leading Singapore public University incorporates Landscape Education within a relatively new module on Toponymy offered in the Linguistics and Multilingual Studies Programme. While the links between Linguistics and a course in Toponymy or even the links between Toponymy and Landscape may not be immediately apparent, an analysis of the content covered in the module demonstrates congruence to existing frameworks and principles in teaching Landscape Education and, at the same time, provides a case in point in interdisciplinarity, drawing from diverse disciplines such as Language, Linguistics, History, Geography, Landscape Sciences, Anthropological Linguistics, among many others. This study provides useful references for educational institutions in incorporating Landscape Education into their curriculum.

AB  - An authentic, interdisciplinary, research and problem-based integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) project may be ideal for encouraging scientific inquiry and developing teamwork among undergraduate students, but it also presents challenges. The authors describe how two interdisciplinary teams (n=6) of undergraduate college students built integrated STEM projects in a research based internship setting, and then collaboratively brought the project to fruition to include designing lessons and activities shared with K-12 students in a classroom setting. Each three person undergraduate team consisted of two STEM majors and one Education major. The Education majors are a special focus for this study. Interviews, field observations, and lesson plan artifacts collected from the undergraduate college students were analyzed according to authenticity factors, the authentic scientific inquiry instrument, and an integrated STEM instrument. The authors highlight areas of strength and weakness for both teams and explore how preservice teachers contributed to integrated STEM products and lessons. Teacher educators might apply recommendations for teacher preparation and professional development when facilitating authentic scientific inquiry and integrated STEM topics with both STEM and non-STEM educators. Undergraduate college students were challenged to fully integrate the STEM disciplines, transitions between them, and the spaces between them where multiple disciplines existed. By describing the challenges of integrating the spaces between STEM, the authors offer a description of the undergraduate college students' experiences in an effort to expand the common message beyond a flat approach of try this activity because it works, to a more robust message of try this type of engagement and purposefully organize for maximum results.

AB  - Environmental science is a broad, interdisciplinary field integrating aspects of biology, chemistry, earth science, geology, and social sciences. Mastery of basic science concepts and reasoning are therefore necessary for students to understand the interactions of different components in an environmental system. How do teachers identify and assess the learning that occurs in introductory environmental science courses? In this article the authors introduce a pre-test and post-test in which students draw and label an ecosystem, showing interactions, terms, and concepts. The assignment is open-ended. The drawings can be a useful diagnostic tool for both the student and the teacher. They may also give insight into geographical, cultural, or social biases and provides a different way of assimilating and processing information. Ecosystem concepts seem to be a powerful way of capturing and reflecting student thinking about environmental settings as dynamic systems.

AB  - This study, undertaken in the Northwest USA, explores how graduate students in an interdisciplinary social-ecological systems research course engaged with concepts of epistemic difference and Indigenous knowledge as part of a required module titled "Ways of Knowing" to engage social and ecological change in climate science. We describe how graduate students engaged with Indigenous ways of knowing and discussion of interdisciplinary equity across knowledge systems and methodologies. Analysis of student perspectives drawn from fieldnotes, student course work, and post-course interviews illuminates tensions in preparing interdisciplinary science researchers to navigate epistemic difference. Students embraced Indigenous ways of knowing as useful for conceptualizing complex tensions in social-ecological systems research, while simultaneously sidestepping deeply rooted issues of power and coloniality in research. We trace two primary ways Indigenous ways of knowing informed interdisciplinary processes in students' conceptualizations of social-ecological challenges: Science as more expansive: Reflexivity and interpersonal dilemmas; and Grappling with power and settler colonial discomfort. We argue that continued engagement in epistemic difference, particularly Indigenous knowledges, is necessary for cultivating scientific engagement in complex notions of knowledge equity in climate sciences involving Indigenous peoples/lands. Finding underscore how changes in graduate research training can expand research imaginaries, however, such expansions need to be systematic and multi-stranded to interrupt the deep-rooted marginalization of non-Western knowledges in scientific research.

AB  - Environmental Education has become over recent decades an emerging area of knowledge; its evolution has been conditioned not only by different regional dynamics, but also by international guidelines and trends. Therefore, the literature reports multiple and diverse pedagogical, curricular and transdisciplinary approaches to this topic. Likewise, studies on the dynamics and trends in the generation and production of knowledge are relevant to both teachers and researchers in every field of knowledge. In this sense, it is presented a bibliometric study that aims to analyse the international scientific production on Environmental Education on the Web of Science (WoS) within the categories Education and Educational Research and Education, Scientific Disciplines for the last two decades (2000-2019). The information obtained was analysed using different bibliometric techniques, like descriptive statistics, degree of collaboration and co-occurrence maps generated by VOSviewer (version 1.6.15) software. The results show the accelerated increase in the production of knowledge in this area, they present the main research contexts, as well as some educational and research perspectives. Also, the collaboration between authors and universities was identified.

AB  - Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is consistently seen as a top priority; however, STEM programs often suffer from low retention. Students who start in STEM degree programs often lose interest or face obstacles that cause them to leave. Here, we describe a non-traditional approach meant to encourage a range of students to pursue or continue their STEM education. Active learning approaches have long been touted to stimulate long-term interest and prepare students for a career in natural science. We provide a case study of an interdisciplinary, cohort-centric, mentor-guided summer research internship. By establishing an understanding of how science is currently conducted in agriculture, through several faculty mentors, the program allowed students to embrace their core interests while being able to fit into larger interdisciplinary narratives which provided motivation to continue their path in STEM education.

AB  - This research intends to provide understanding of the impact that a module consisting entirely of collaborative interdisciplinary science tasks had on students' group work behaviour, attitude and motivation. It was hypothesised that implementing a module based entirely of group tasks would develop positive attitudes and increase student accountability. Previous research indicates that large introductory modules in higher education fail to nurture student motivation to engage with course work. In this study 303 students completed surveys and focus groups that examined the level and nature of group work, student feelings towards group work, and student motivation to complete tasks and attend timetabled class sessions. The findings suggest that in order to complete the science tasks, students typically completed sections individually and consolidated their individual parts to form a complete solution. Collaboration occurred when students completed numerical aspects of the task as students felt these sections demanded group members to share ideas. Collaborative work can promote positive student attitudes, increase students efforts to work on tasks and attend timetabled class sessions. These findings imply that collaborative work may act as a means of promoting attendance and facilitating student engagement in module activities throughout the semester. This study highlights the need for educators to assess learning outcomes achieved in higher education and to distinguish between tasks that promote working collaboratively and collaborative learning.

AB  - Course outlines for science teachers, designed and developed at 6 universities, were critically analysed and compared with the guidelines for science education set out in the national policy framework known as the Minimum Requirements for Teacher Education Qualifications (MRTEQ) to identify the characteristics of a competent science teacher. Researchers used qualitative means to elicit data from the curriculum documents and in-depth interviews with science teacher educators at the institutions that participated in the study. The analysis of data focused on identifying views and perspectives that informed selection and organisation of curriculum content and pedagogical approaches. The findings that emerged from the data analysis point to both convergence and divergence among science teacher educators in terms of (i) interpretations of the policy on the minimum requirements for teacher qualifications, (ii) conceptualising hybridisation of academic content knowledge from different disciplines in the fields of science, and (iii) conceptualisation of pedagogical content knowledge for integrated approaches to teaching and learning of knowledge. A lack of uniformity in the conceptualised academic content and the conceptual framework to develop pedagogical content knowledge for the interdisciplinary school subject, Natural Sciences, pointed to the challenges facing departments of sciences education to produce competent teachers.

AB  - Living in a Delta, amidst water, land and air, means living and engaging with complex concerns. To address these concerns the Rotterdam Arts and Sciences Lab (RASL) has developed an education- and research program for Higher Education in which the (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-) sciences and the arts are combined to engage with with all of the scales, entanglements and complex societal concerns of this Delta-multiple: Delta Studies. Delta Studies can therefore be understood as a companion to the alpha, beta and gamma sciences, as it sets out from and blurs, 'composes' (Latour, 2010) and 'composts' (Haraway, 2016) with, the sciences and the arts. Delta Studies exists through combining and composing with the skills and knowledges of the arts and the sciences as well as the situated knowledges of societal partners. In this manner, it questions existing hierarchies of ways of knowing and making public(s) in order to create new ways to engage with complex concerns and reimagine our collective futures. This article presents the guiding propositions of Delta Studies.

AB  - For several decades there has been a broad consensus on the need to promote scientific literacy and, ultimately, to promote the full development of student competency from an early age. However, many of the results recorded in the educational field are not very encouraging. Although interdisciplinarity has a more extensive trajectory, the continuous questioning of traditional teaching methods, due to their inefficiency, has given rise to the emergence of educational approaches that integrate the teaching of diverse scientific disciplines in a more contextualized, coherent, and comprehensive manner. The body of empirical research on the application of these approaches has grown, while leaving behind some essential theoretical questions. In the present work, a theoretical framework is proposed for integrated science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education, a current teaching approach with the important momentum. Based on the epistemological stance of Larry Laudan, three levels of scientific commitment are adopted: with theories, methods, and aims. Regarding the theoretical commitment, three axes of support are established for this framework: epistemological, psychological, and didactical. This mechanism allows us to construct a consistent model that may contribute to developing coherent integrated STEM education. In addition, an example of a real application of this theoretical framework is provided in the design, implementation, and evaluation of a STEM didactic unit in the primary education stage, demonstrating its coherence and viability.

AB  - The rising demand for digital information resources and services in the LAM sector has sparked many innovations by educators in recent years, as we seek to prepare students for careers in an environment that has continued to witness rapid and hard-to-predict changes. Granting agencies such as IMLS have played an important role in driving innovation to meet the needs of new professionals, in part by funding curriculum development projects within LIS schools, but also by facilitating dialogues between educators and practitioners. This work traces a 10-year process whereby one LIS school has designed and tested new courses as well as a new Master's concentration geared to the needs of LAM professionals who will be expected to work intensively with digital technologies, workflows, and collections. Through a succession of projects, some with grant funding, the school has been able to engage practitioners on an ongoing basis, enabling it to build a substantial and regularly updated body of case-study data on LAM practices, which has informed course development efforts and which has enabled the school to meet its key objectives of delivering authentic learning experiences for students and to maintain an up-to-date curriculum in an evolving area of study within the LAM disciplines. It is hoped that both the experience and the results to date will help justify continued support for innovations in LAM education.

AB  - The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) have spurred renewed interest in the epistemologies that students adopt as they engage in science practices. One framework for characterizing students' epistemologies is the "epistemologies in practice" framework (Berland et al. (2016), "Journal of Research in Science Teaching," 53(7), 1082-1112), which focuses on students' meaningful use of four epistemic considerations: Nature, Generality, Justification, and Audience. To date, research based on the framework has primarily examined students' use of the epistemic considerations in the context of diagrammatic modeling. However, with computational technologies becoming more prevalent in science classrooms, the framework could be applied to investigate students' engagement in computational modeling. Moreover, computational modeling could be particularly beneficial to a fast-growing population of multilingual learners (MLs) in the U.S. K-12 context, who benefit from leveraging multiple meaning-making resources (e.g., code, dynamic visualization). This study examined MLs' meaningful use of four epistemic considerations in the context of computational modeling in an elementary science classroom. Fifth-grade MLs (N = 11) participated in two interviews about computational models they had developed as part of two NGSS-designed instructional units that integrated computational modeling (in addition to other model types). Findings indicated that, while students used all four epistemic considerations across the interviews, some considerations (Nature and Generality) were used more frequently than others (Justification and Audience). Beyond diagrammatic modeling, "computational" modeling offered unique affordances for MLs to meaningfully use the considerations as well as to communicate this use, though not without some emergent challenges. Overall, this study highlights the promise of computational modeling for providing a rich sense-making and meaning-making context for MLs to use epistemic considerations. The study also highlights the importance of attending to both epistemic and linguistic aspects of MLs' science learning as well as the potential of interdisciplinary research for studying this learning.

AB  - Objective: To examine the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary, discovery-oriented teaching unit designed to provide science and health information about HIV from the perspective of viral biology, population statistics and epidemiology. Design: Single group pre- and post-curriculum pilot study. Setting: Fifteen middle and high school classrooms recruited from districts in and around a large, diverse, urban area in the mid-southern USA. Method: Science educators, clinicians, virologists and biologists collaborated to develop a set of five activities intended to increase content knowledge related to HIV, while developing students' science-related skills in the context of an authentic, relevant example. The activities were piloted with six hundred and twenty-four 12- to 18-year-old students. Multiple-choice pre- and post-tests were used to assess changes in students' knowledge, and teacher evaluations were used to gauge appropriateness of content, ease of activity implementation and teacher perceptions of student skill development, learning and engagement. Results: Student pre- and post-tests and teacher post-evaluations indicated that the curriculum was effective in increasing content knowledge for students across all age ranges, with 13- to 14-year-old, grade 8 students achieving the greatest knowledge gains. Teacher-reported information also suggested that students were able to apply relevant skills to their interpretation of authentic data related to the incidence and transmission of HIV infection around the world. Conclusion: The developed activities have the potential to provide timely, relevant information to students while strengthening science-related content knowledge and skills as well as health literacy.

AB  - The complexity of modern biology poses challenges in fostering interdisciplinary understanding, particularly between practicing scientists and the public. Furthermore, scientists often lack formal training in science communication, despite various motivations to engage the public. The science literacy of the public in the biological sciences can also vary across socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. Leveraging popular culture and informal learning practices to promote active learning offers promising avenues to enhance public understanding of biological systems. Organized sports hold collective recognition across various communities and cultures, serving as a means to bring people together. Notably, the NCAA March Madness event holds widespread national and international popularity, presenting an opportunity to laterally apply this concept to promote science communication within STEM and biology education. An educational social media and web-based contest tool was developed integrating NCAA-inspired brackets with animal biological systems concepts. The tool featured tournament-style matchups based on animal biological systems, interesting animal facts, and a voting system, all housed within a user-friendly interface. To encourage regular user access to the tool, graphic designs were developed for all social media posts to aid in visual recruitment to the voting website. Based on online metrics, the use of social media garnered repeat users across both the public and educators. The latter noted the tool's simplicity and informative content. Application of this social media and web-based bracket contest tool, which leverages informal settings for active learning for use in biology education, can foster science communication to engage audiences, improve comprehension, and promote interdisciplinary biology education.

AB  - Responsible citizenship and sound decision-making in today's information age necessitate an appreciation of the role of uncertainty in the process of generating data-based scientific knowledge. The latter calls for coordinating between different types of uncertainties, related to three types of relevant reasoning: statistical, scientific, and nature of science uncertainties. This article examines separately the uncertainties that young students articulate as they engage in activities designed to concurrently foster all three types of reasoning, and also explores how these different types can interrelate. The context of Citizen Science is particularly suited for this goal, providing a unique pedagogical opportunity for learning scientific content by engaging learners in authentic scientific practices, including data analysis. Based on literature from the three fields of statistics, science and nature of science education, we offer an integrative framework, Deterministic Relativistic and Middle ground (DReaM), which consists of nine sub-categories of uncertainty articulations. We utilize it to analyze an instrumental case study of a pair of middle school students' (ages 13 and 14) participation in a pilot study of an interdisciplinary extended learning sequence, as part of the Radon Citizen Science Project. The results of an interpretative microgenetic analysis identified all nine DReaM uncertainty articulations sub-categories. These are illustrated in the Findings section with key scenes from the pair's participation. The discussion depicts how these sub-categories manifested in this particular case study and suggests interrelations between them in a more extended depiction of the DReaM framework. We conclude with the pedagogical implications of the extended framework.

AB  - In the last decade, game-based learning has received growing attention in educational contexts in general and science education in particular. A recent game trend, which has also found its way into STEM classrooms, is escape rooms. In this type of game, players have to work through several puzzles to achieve a specific goal (mostly to escape from an actual room). We conducted a systematic literature review to find out whether the "market" for such games is already saturated or if there is still potential for further development. After searching the common databases (ERIC, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, as well as the German database FIS Bildung), we analyzed 93 journal articles, book chapters, and conference papers in English and German from the following domains: chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, computer science, general science (interdisciplinary), environmental science, and medicine. We selected the ones that targeted a specific educational level (primary, secondary or tertiary education) and were designed for formal educational settings. It transpired that there is a need for more easily adaptable escape rooms as well as for more empirical evidence on their actual effects.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to design, implement, and evaluate a course according to a STEM education approach for pre-service science teachers. The study was conducted in three phases according to an educational design research method: preliminary research, development or prototyping, and assessment (Plomp & Nieveen, 2013). The STEM education pre-knowledge form, STEM lesson plans, the STEM lesson plan evaluation form, STEM self-evaluation, and peer-evaluation forms, and a semi-structured face-to-face interview form were used as qualitative data collection tools. Data were analyzed by methods of content analysis. The results suggest that pre-service science teachers need education in the dimensions of the theoretical structure of STEM education, STEM disciplines and integration, 21st-century skills, sample STEM activities, current science curriculum, STEM learning/teaching methods and techniques, measurement and assessment for STEM education, collaboration with peers, and planning-implementing a lesson according to STEM education. The findings showed that the STEM course design developed through this study was seen to be effective in responding pre-service teachers' needs. In STEM course design, six activities were prepared in the context of designing a 21st-century house and designing a vehicle according to the trans-disciplinary model and hands on minds on method. According to the relevant literature, the findings were discussed and future studies should provide collaboration with pre-service teachers, students, and in-service teachers. Future studies should also focus on developing the knowledge and skills of pre-service teachers about engineering and technology discipline and show how to integrate these disciplines into their real-life problems.

AB  - Nolan and Temple Lang's "Computing in the Statistics Curricula" (2010) advocated for a shift in statistical education to broadly include computing. In the time since, individuals with training in both computing and statistics have become increasingly employable in the burgeoning data science field. In response, universities have developed new courses and programs to meet the growing demand for data science education. To address this demand, we created Data Science in Practice, a large-enrollment undergraduate course. Here, we present our goals for teaching this course, including: (1) conceptualizing data science as creative problem solving, with a focus on project-based learning, (2) prioritizing practical application, teaching and using standardized tools and best practices, and (3) scaling education through coursework that enables hands-on and classroom learning in a large-enrollment course. Throughout this course we also emphasize social context and data ethics to best prepare students for the interdisciplinary and impactful nature of their work. We highlight creative problem solving and strategies for teaching automation-resilient skills, while providing students the opportunity to create a unique data science project that demonstrates their technical and creative capacities.

AB  - Purpose: The article explores the roles of war and violent conflicts in citizenship education. Approach: This is a theoretical article, drawing on literature from the interdisciplinary fields of political science, history, citizenship education as well as field studies in different learning arenas, war memorial sites- and museums. Findings: There are divergent roles of war in citizenship education, and the typology of five didactic perspectives illustrates the challenges concerning the types of citizenship it aims at. Narratives of war could produce and contribute to different forms of citizenship or even represent the opposite of the concept. Research limitations: Further empirical research is needed to develop knowledge on how to deal with war and conflict in educational practice, both in schools and other learning arenas. Practical implications: The article contributes to addressing and structuring the challenges and potentials of didactic approaches to war and violent conflict in citizenship education.

AB  - Understanding data analysis and interpreting data are key components of teaching interdisciplinary undergraduate students. We detail a semester-long research project that introduces students to long-term data sets, incorporates the use of widely available statistical analysis, and underscores an inquiry-based method of teaching climate change. Our learning objectives included analysis of large-scale climate data and interpretation of empirical trends in the context of two climate change phenomena: warming and the urban heat island effect. We demonstrate how small groups of students (n = 2 or 3) were empowered to independently download and analyze long-term temperature data to be aggregated into a class data set. Students used the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) to find the long-term data sets of hourly maximum (TMAX) and minimum (TMIN) temperatures. Students used the open-source statistical software R to manage and summarize data. Students also examined changes in land use cover using Google Earth satellite data to quantify whether stations were urban or rural. Students were assessed in their groups based on a research paper and a class presentation. Approaching climate change education from the inquiry-based learning perspective allows students to understand how scientific research is conducted, apply the scientific method, and experience firsthand the importance of open-source data.

AB  - This edited volume brings together a state-of-the-art collection of leading and emergent research on the burgeoning topic of science identities. It sets out how science identity can be productively used as a lens in understanding patterns and inequalities in science participation across different educational and international contexts. Its chapters reveal how intersections of social identities and inequalities shape participation and engagement in science. Particular attention is given to explicating issues of theory and method, identifying the potential and limitations of approaches and lacunae in existing knowledge. The book showcases research from a range of disciplinary areas, employing diverse methodological and conceptual approaches to investigate science identities across different fields and settings. The collection offers a rich and comprehensive understanding of how science identity can be used conceptually, methodologically and analytically to understand how learners and teachers relate to, and make sense of, science. It's a valuable resource for students, researchers and academics in the field of science education and anyone who is interested in identity and education.

AB  - Objectives: Research almost always culminates in the communication of findings. Despite the necessity of grant and manuscript writing throughout academic careers, scientific trainees often receive little guided practice in written communication. To fill this gap, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a voluntary writing initiative for biomedical students at a research-intensive (R1) university in the midwestern United States called Writing Initiative in Neuroscience (WIN). Method: WIN consisted of didactic and workshop components. The didactic component included discussions with topic-specific experts on writing grants and manuscripts for the public and for non-academic scientific careers. The workshop component consisted of small group-based peer review of participant writing samples. Student self-enrollment consistently filled all available seats over three separate cohorts, including those formed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Student self-assessments were implemented to determine improvements quantitatively and qualitatively in writing and peer-review across 3 years of WIN programming. Results: Student self-assessment of writing skills before and after programming revealed improved scientific writing competency with medium or large effect sizes. Qualitative self-assessments indicated perceived improvements in writing competency and confidence. Collectively, students who participated in WIN improved their writing and communication skills and gained experience in providing and receiving feedback. Conclusions: Ultimately, peer-led writing initiatives, such as WIN, may enhance scholarly training and lay a foundation for future trainee writing success across scientific disciplines. Implications for Theory or Practice: These results support the utility of a student-centered writing workshop for biomedical students. Our study combined aspects of multiple existing resources, including peer feedback, interdisciplinary student backgrounds, and professional editing guidance. Together, these features formed a flexible and practical writing workshop, which can be used as a template for biomedical training programs.

AB  - In this paper we highlight the issues and opportunities of a participatory action research (PAR) and co-design project, currently being undertaken as engaged research between academics at Durham University and practitioners at the UK's International Centre for Life in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne (CfL; see creativescienceatlife.com for more information and developments). The focus is on the use of PAR to enable university researchers and Science Centre professionals to co-design Informal Science Learning exhibits that enhance creativity and innovation in young people. We define the principles of PAR and explore reasons for adopting the approach. An account is provided of the iterative co-design and piloting of a novel exhibit within a new exhibition space at the CfL. Reflections collated independently by the practitioners and the academics involved highlighting the development of ideas and insights over the course of the PAR process. We discuss how PAR enabled effective engagement with and creation of enriched knowledge, and innovation, in both the academy and science-learning professionals. The added value of PAR and co-production to our project aligns with current calls for a redefining of how societal impact of academic research is considered.

AB  - By framing entrepreneurship courses in the context of interdisciplinary team projects, students build important work-related skills whether they pursue an entrepreneurial path or employment after graduation. However, the traditional classroom environment is not conducive to realistic interdepartmental interactions found in most corporations or startups. The authors describe a model for interdisciplinary collaboration between students in entrepreneurship and computer science engineering programs to cultivate the development of real software products. The authors outline the partnership and illustrate how sister courses covering lean startup and agile software development methodologies complement each other to foster realistic projects.

AB  - Interdisciplinary education offers a collaborative approach to multifaceted topics, such as environmental sustainability. In this article, we present the conceptual framework and lessons learned from a team-taught course, entitled Sustainability, Energy, and the Green Economy (SEGE). Faculty from the departments of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology offered the course during the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 academic years at Bronx Community College (BCC). The described interdisciplinary approach was intended to engage students through research-driven, project-based learning using life cycle analysis (LCA) of a simple consumer product. By teaching solution-oriented approaches, SEGE translates complex real-world problems into classroom learning for nonSTEM majors. As compared to student performance and engagement data from three 100-level STEM courses at BCC, analyses of C or above grade performance, passing rate, and withdrawal rate indicate that SEGE effectively engaged and retained students. Additionally, student surveys are presented, and were used to guide instructional strategy for effective team teaching and assessment.

AB  - A perennial goal of science educators is to develop functional scientific literacy in their students, especially those who will not become professional scientists. This article provides an example of implementing a socioscientific issues approach in an undergraduate environmental science course that enables students to develop the knowledge, reasoning, and skills requisite for resolving complex issues in a sustainable manner for people and the environment now and in the future. This example incorporates an interdisciplinary approach by leveraging traditional laboratory investigations and information from outside of science proper to facilitate a deeper and more nuanced understanding of gray wolves returning to Northern California.

AB  - Anatomical education is pivotal for medical students, and innovative technologies like augmented reality (AR) are transforming the field. This study aimed to enhance the interactive features of the "AEducAR" prototype, an AR tool developed by the University of Bologna, and explore its impact on human anatomy learning process in 130 second-year medical students at the International School of Medicine and Surgery of the University of Bologna. An interdisciplinary team of anatomists, maxillofacial surgeons, biomedical engineers, and educational scientists collaborated to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the study's objectives. Students used the updated version of "AEducAR," named "AEducAR 2.0," to study three anatomical topics, specifically the orbit zone, facial bones, and mimic muscles. "AEducAR 2.0" offered two learning activities: one explorative and one interactive. Following each activity, students took a test to assess learning outcomes. Students also completed an anonymous questionnaire to provide background information and offer their perceptions of the activity. Additionally, 10 students participated in interviews for further insights. The results demonstrated that "AEducAR 2.0" effectively facilitated learning and students' engagement. Students totalized high scores in both quizzes and declared to have appreciated the interactive features that were implemented. Moreover, interviews shed light on the interesting topic of blended learning. In particular, the present study suggests that incorporating AR into medical education alongside traditional methods might prove advantageous for students' academic and future professional endeavors. In this light, this study contributes to the growing research emphasizing the potential role of AR in shaping the future of medical education.

AB  - Family and consumer sciences (FCS) is an interdisciplinary study of the relationships between humans and their social, natural, and built environments. Critical thinking has been a vital part of the profession since its beginning. Ellen Swallow Richards founded the discipline in 1899 on the premise of improving quality of life for individuals, families, and communities by using critical thinking skills. The postmodern perspective of the profession integrates knowledge and applies science to complex issues facing families in society (Richards, 2000). Using this perspective, FCS educators help individuals use critical thinking to make informed decisions about well-being, relationships, and resources to achieve optimal quality of life. The National Association of State Administrators for Family and Consumer Sciences (NASAFCS) advocates critical thinking skills to promote reasoning for technical, interpretive, and reflective action on a problem while connecting academic and FCS content in the classroom (NASAFCS, 2008).

AB  - University students, faculty, and staff from science, engineering, education, entrepreneurship, and design (SEE(E)D) backgrounds developed a video game to leverage outreach efforts promoting sustainability, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ((S)STEM) to underserved students. This was accomplished by transforming a board game--previously developed and used to teach elementary students about complex and often misunderstood energy and sustainability issues--through a collaborative design process. The process of taking a tangible board game into the digital realm required significant design and pedagogical adaptations to maintain student learning outcomes and content delivery. Scientists, educators, and designers strengthened the graphical and pedagogical aspects of the game collaboratively to ultimately expand and deepen the energy literacy of elementary school students. This design case seeks to elucidate the multidisciplinary collaborative design process used by SEE(E)D faculty and researchers as well as students to redesign a board game into a didactic video game that is easier to both deploy and disseminate for the benefit of K-12 students and teachers.

AB  - Purpose: The paper aims to explore and analyse the potential of campus living learning laboratory (LLL) as an integrated mechanism to provide the innovative and creative teaching and learning experiences, robust research output and strengthening the campus sustainability initiatives by using the sustainability science approach. Design/methodology/approach: The challenge to adopt sustainability science as an interdisciplinary approach juxtaposed against the structure, teaching and learning of single disciplinary approach in institution of higher education (IHE). The LLL approach can be one of the options on how the integrative teaching and learning, combination fundamental and applied research and campus operations should conduct to strengthen the implementation of campus sustainability. Findings: The review of application of LLL from several campus sustainability and combining with the experiences in conducting the UTM Campus sustainability results the strategic operational mechanism of the integration process. Research limitations/implications: The LLL approach which applies the sustainability science approach did not cover the challenges and issue related to the inter-, inter- and trans-disciplinary during the campus LLL application. Further study needs to be conducted to strengthen the fundamental approach to developing campus LLL as one approach to operationalizing the Sustainable Development agenda in IHE. Practical implications: The experiences and findings produces from this study help other campus sustainability to articulate the benefits of campus LLL initiatives, anticipate implementation challenges in teaching and learning, research output and the operation. The problem-solving nature of sustainability science provides a platform for implementing campus sustainability initiatives which allow inter-, inter- and trans-disciplinary approach for a more synergize effort of a real case study and project based approach. Social implications: Furthermore, the implementation of LLL challenges the researcher/academia to provide prompt response as part of societal learning process in strengthening applied-based research as well as to contribute to the fundamental research. Successful LLL approach require both top-down commitments from the top management of the university and bottom-up drive from interested faculty, core research themes, operations and students. Originality/value: The integrative framework and operational mechanism to operate LLL in campus sustainability which resulted from the analysis taken from several universities that implement campus sustainability is the origin values of significant contribution from this study.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the value of teachers guiding students to generate their own representations to support conceptual learning in science and across complementary subjects such as mathematics. However, this approach to an interdisciplinary focus poses challenges for programme design and learning assessment. In this paper, we report on a 10-week study with a class of Year 5 students designed to (a) facilitate learning of key concepts in the topic of optics (e.g. reflection), and (b) make meaningful links between these concepts and relevant mathematical ones (e.g. symmetry and angles). Students were expected to construct, evaluate and refine representations to explain various experienced phenomena. We report on an assessment framework developed and applied to student work. Our findings indicate (a) some subject and interdisciplinary learning gains, and (b) specific challenges around designing this kind of programme, student learning assessment and teacher understanding to support this learning.

AB  - Sketchnoting is a design methodology that involves communicating concepts visually. This active learning tool has shown potential for influencing student learning but its applications have been limited. Adopting the principles of research related to the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning and employing Mayer's cognitive theory of multimedia learning, our interdisciplinary team from industrial design, biology, and education incorporated this pedagogical tool in an undergraduate upper-level ecology course and assessed its effectiveness. We found that students' perceptions of the value of using tools such as sketchnoting did not significantly change after being introduced to the tool, but over two-thirds of students found the tool valuable and would recommend it to other students. The percentages of students who used the tool never or seldom, remained similar over the semester, but a much higher percentage of students increased their use of sketchnoting. We found that there were differences in how students utilized sketchnoting for learning. Students reported the importance of using sketchnoting for communicating. Because drawings are critical ways to communicate science, teaching visual representation techniques such as sketchnoting can improve science students'ability to identify and solve problems; subsequently improving their long-term success. Additional research exploring why and how this approach could be integrated within college coursework and how it can support learning in science is needed. Framed as an example of SoTL work, our efforts also highlight the iterative nature of these projects and the importance for researchers and faculty members to embrace the multiple roles of teacher and learner.

AB  - Integrated Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education has gained popularity worldwide. With the twenty-first century's different economic, political, and societal needs, nations intend to train citizens as better problem solvers. The current integrated STEM movement has influenced science curriculum documents and science teaching and learning to address those issues. To attain the goals of recent reform, teachers' understanding of the essential characteristics of integrated STEM education and learning implementation of the STEM activities with engineering design challenges are required. The related literature has stated that teachers' voices should be heard to address their needs through professional development (PD). In light of that point, in this needs assessment study, we intended to determine in-service chemistry teachers' expectations from and needs for implementing integrated STEM education. Data were collected from 112 chemistry teachers via open-ended questions. Results showed that most of the teachers stated that they expect to experience integrated STEM activities with their active participation through PDs. Additionally, the participants highlighted their expectations from a PD design to learn what integrated STEM education is and its essential features. Learning how to integrate STEM activities into lessons, developing integrated STEM lesson plans, and interdisciplinary chemistry teaching were other participants' expectations. Examples of participants' needs were learning implementation of integrated STEM education, integrating chemistry with STEM disciplines, finding chemistry-based STEM activities, and learning engineering design process and product. In order to reach PDs' goals set, first of all, teachers' needs for and expectations from the PDs should be determined regarding the STEM approach and then the PDs in which the teachers take a role as active participants should be organized.

AB  - This paper describes the 20-year evolution of an information studies program from one primarily focused on librarianship, to one that now encompasses a range of interdisciplinary topics including knowledge management, user-experience design, data science, and bioinformatics, among others. The program revisions, course development, and faculty renewal were guided by the School's strategic plan to centre its teaching and research on the focus of the interaction between people and information, supported by technology. Over twenty years, the proportion of interdisciplinary courses increased from less than 10% to almost half. There were a number of challenges throughout the process, including finding the right balance within the program, maintaining accreditation, and working with limited resources. Yet, the outcomes have been well worth the effort, and we suggest best practices based on our lessons learned.

AB  - Focus of this article is the current situation characterized by students' de-rootedness and possible measures to improve the situation within the frame of education for sustainable development. My main line of argument is that science teachers can practice teaching in such a way that students are brought in deeper contact to the environment. I discuss efforts to promote aesthetic experience in science class and in science teacher education. Within a wide range of definitions, my main understanding of aesthetic experience is that of pre-conceptual experience, relational to the environment and incorporated in students' embodied knowledge. I ground the idea of Earth at rest in Husserl's phenomenological philosophy and Heidegger's notion of science' deprivation of the world. A critique of the ontological reversal leads to an ontological re-reversal that implies giving lifeworld experience back its value and rooting scientific concepts in students' everyday lives. Six aspects of facilitating grounding in sustainability-oriented science teaching and teacher education are highlighted and discussed: students' everyday knowledge and experience, aesthetic experience and grounding, fostering aesthetic sensibility, cross-curricular integration with art, ontological and epistemological aspects, and belongingness and (re-)connection to Earth. I conclude that both science students and student-teachers need to practice their sense of caring and belonging, as well as refining their sensibility towards the world. With an intention of educating for a sustainable development, there is an urgent need for a critical discussion in science education when it comes to engaging learners for a sustainable future.

AB  - The survey data suggest a high technical and sufficient psychological readiness of Yaroslavl State University students to use mobile devices in learning. The results of the research prove that students have an above the average level of interest and motivation in learning with the help of mobile devices. Nevertheless, it is obvious that there is a need for popularizing mobile learning among students through organization of explanatory talks and encouragement on the part of the teaching staff. Two multidisciplinary cases with using modern IT-technologies in university educational process are presented. [For the complete proceedings, see ED579190.]

AB  - In a world of burgeoning societal issues, future scientists must be equipped to work interdisciplinarily to address real-world problems. To train undergraduate students toward this end, practitioners must also have quality assessment tools to measure students' ability to think within an interdisciplinary system. There is, however, a dearth of instruments that accurately measure this competency. Using a theoretically and empirically based model, we developed an instrument, the Interdisciplinary Science Rubric (IDSR), to measure undergraduate students' interdisciplinary science thinking. An essay assignment was administered to 102 students across five courses at three different institutions. Students' work was scored with the newly developed rubric. Evidence of construct validity was established through novice and expert response processes via semistructured, think-aloud interviews with 29 students and four instructors to ensure the constructs and criteria within the instrument were operating as intended. Interrater reliability of essay scores was collected with the instructors of record ([kappa] = 0.67). An expert panel of discipline-based education researchers (n = 11) were consulted to further refine the scoring metric of the rubric. Results indicate that the IDSR produces valid data to measure undergraduate students' ability to think interdisciplinarily in science.

AB  - Mastery of quantitative skills is increasingly critical for student success in life sciences, but few curricula adequately incorporate quantitative skills. Quantitative Biology at Community Colleges (QB@CC) is designed to address this need by building a grassroots consortium of community college faculty to (1) engage in interdisciplinary partnerships that increase participant confidence in life science, mathematics, and statistics domains; (2) generate and publish a collection of quantitative skills--focused open education resources (OER); and (3) disseminate these OER and pedagogical practices widely, in turn expanding the network. Currently in its third year, QB@CC has recruited 70 faculty into the network and created 20 modules. Modules can be accessed by interested biology and mathematics educators in high school, 2-year, and 4-year institutions. Here, we use survey responses, focus group interviews, and document analyses (principles-focused evaluation) to evaluate the progress in accomplishing these goals midway through the QB@CC program. The QB@CC network provides a model for developing and sustaining an interdisciplinary community that benefits participants and generates valuable resources for the broader community. Similar network-building programs may wish to adopt some of the effective aspects of the QB@CC network model to meet their objectives.

AB  - Recent reforms in science education have supported the inclusion of engineering in K-12 curricula. To this end, many science classrooms have incorporated engineering units that include design tasks. Design is an integral part of engineering and helps students think in creative and interdisciplinary ways. In this study, we examined middle-school students' naturally occurring design conversations in small design teams and their learning of science as a result of engaging in an engineering and science unit. We found that the proportion of different thought processes used by boys and girls was quite similar. Both girls and boys produced a higher percentage of ideas or thoughts associated with divergent thinking, but a lower proportion in convergent thinking, evaluative thinking, and cognitive memory. In addition, gender composition of design teams influenced thought processes expressed by girls and boys. Interestingly, in mixed teams, both girls and boys expressed less divergent thinking than those in single-sex teams. With regard to science content learning, both girls and boys showed statistically significant learning gains. There were no significant gender differences in the pre- and post-test scores. These results suggest that participating in an engineering design task in small design teams provided students opportunities to engage in productive thinking and enhance their learning of the targeted science concept--ecosystems.

AB  - Common core standards, interdisciplinary education, and discipline-specific literacy are common international education reforms. The constructive-interpretative language arts pairs (speaking-listening, writing-reading, representing-viewing) and the communication, construction, and persuasion functions of language are central in these movements. This research developed and validated a communication progression in science education for elementary-secondary schooling in Taiwan. The framework for the communication progression was based on relevant literature, international curricula, and focus-group deliberations; it consisted of three dimensions: presentation, reaction, and negotiation. Delphi deliberations with questionnaires were applied to experts to evaluate the theoretical considerations and to experienced science teachers to evaluate the practical considerations. Results confirmed the importance of communications in science learning and the developmental nature of communications across elementary, middle, and secondary schools and validated the proposed framework and progression. The communication progression has application to other international education systems as they address common core standards and curricula in language and science.

AB  - There has been a growing need as preservice teachers develop competencies regarding convergence. Focused on a discussion of blended learning before the COVID-19 pandemic versus online learning in the epidemic, we aimed to explore whether preservice teachers' attitudes toward convergence can be influenced by the learning environment. Participants were a total of three hundred preservice teachers who attended the science teaching method courses training their TPACK at a teachers college in South Korea during the 2018 to 2020 academic years (194 in the blended learning group and 106 in the online learning group). Survey data on five subcomponents of attitudes toward convergence were collected at the start and end of the courses and analyzed using ANOVA and ANCOVA. As result, preservice teachers' responses to the attitudes toward convergence in the pretests have a significant difference, whereas the overall scores in the posttests revealed no significant difference in the modalities of learning environments. Consequently, the preservice teachers engaged in the courses enhanced positive attitudes toward convergence regardless of delivery methods either blended learning or online learning. This paper provides evidence that the two teaching modalities of curriculum studies have the potential to foster preservice teachers' attitudes toward convergence. This study supports that the blended and online learning formats of the course were feasible to induce short-term improvements in bias affective domains under the learning environments of science teaching method courses.

AB  - First-Year Seminars (FYS) offer a unique mode of introducing college students to new topics, research practices, and approaches to learning that they may not have been exposed to in high school. In this article, we outline the successes and challenges of team teaching a combined cultural anthropology and biochemistry course on the topic of blood, an aspect of our everyday lives that is both vital and hidden. Using our own experiences in and out of the classroom along with direct student feedback, we discuss the importance and relevance of using interdisciplinary, team-taught FYS to engage, excite, and educate students about the inherent value of thinking and working across disciplinary boundaries.

AB  - Climate change (CC) is the most significant global issue facing humanity, yet research addressing the perspectives of the key players influential in developing and implementing school-based CC curricula at a cross-country national level is scarce. This study examined the perceptions of policymakers, teacher professional development providers and CCE teachers in relation to: CC knowledge, representation in the curriculum, content and pedagogy, and support for teaching. The voices of these educators were gathered across five countries (Australia, England, Finland, Indonesia, and Israel) through semi-structured interviews. Analysis revealed much commonality across the countries and across role types. Although participants agreed that CCE is multidisciplinary and expressed widespread support for including CC in the curriculum through a cross-curriculum approach, their conceptualisations of CC knowledge were inconsistent. Participants recognised the importance of a science basis in CCE, and of student action, with some participants also emphasising emotional, ethical and value-based inclusions. Most suggested active learning focused pedagogies. Variations in approaches to CC implementation between countries suggest that CCE is in a transitional phase. In all five countries, the interviewees called for the curriculum to make more explicit connections to CC and for governmental leadership in supporting CCE, professional development and provision of resources.

AB  - The current K-12 educational system often does not engage students in interdisciplinary learning. To address this need, we developed an integrated STEM + L (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math, and Digital Literacies) afterschool programme in which middle school students took discipline-specific roles (writer, scientist, artist, and engineer) and worked in small groups to produce multimodal science fictions. The study aims to investigate the effect of discipline-specific roles on students' interdisciplinary and collaborative learning processes. Two groups were chosen as comparison cases because their final products indicated low and high levels in integrating science and literacy respectively. Analysing and visualising students' individual role-changing patterns and examining their discourse in role-specific interactions revealed the following features for high-quality interdisciplinary learning: (1) Students need to be willing and able to enact not only expected roles, but also other roles; (2) Students need to develop awareness of their own and others' role enactment; (3) Collaboration between students with different roles may follow a possible trajectory from solo-construction, to co-construction, to re-construction. This study also proposes instructional strategies related to the design of discipline-specific roles to facilitate interdisciplinary learning in STEM education.

AB  - The field of DNA nanotechnology has grown rapidly in the past decade and has expanded to multiple laboratories. While lectures in DNA nanotechnology have been introduced in some institutions, laboratory components at the undergraduate level are still lacking. Undergraduate students predominantly learn about DNA nanotechnology through their involvement as interns in research laboratories. The DNA nanostructure biostability analysis experiment presented here can be used as a hands-on introductory laboratory exercise for discussing concepts in DNA nanotechnology in an undergraduate setting. This experiment discusses biostability, gel electrophoresis and quantitative analysis of nuclease degradation of a model DNA nanostructure, the paranemic crossover (PX) DNA motif. The experiment can be performed in a chemistry, biology, or biochemistry laboratory with minimal costs and can be adapted in undergraduate institutions using the instructor and student manuals provided here. Laboratory courses based on cutting edge research not only provide students a direct hands-on approach to the subject, but also can increase undergraduate student participation in research. Moreover, laboratory courses that reflect the increasingly multidisciplinary nature of research add value to undergraduate education.

AB  - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics or "STEM" focused pedagogy has been influenced changes in education for decades. Responding to the need for interdisciplinary skilled workforces, the STEM approach has been revised firstly to reflect the incorporation of Arts, (STEAM) and, more recently, to place stronger emphasis on cross-disciplinary connections. However, there is little empirical evidence to drive the development of a practical model for classroom implementation. This systematic review aims to consolidate existing empirical evidence on the incorporation of interdisciplinary learning via a STEM/STEAM approach in high-school environments using a PRISMA review scaffolding. The review identified ninety-nine articles that addressed interdisciplinary learning. However, the majority of them were excluded due to the lack of empirical evidence for such improvements, resulting in only eleven studies being included in the final synthesis. This suggests that more research is required prior to wide-scale implementation within high school education systems. Of those that met the selection criteria, the overarching theme was that improved outcomes were best achieved via either a real-world project-based or problem-based learning pedagogy with the use of community and industry support. However, due to the low number of studies found to fit the criteria, it is recommended that further research is conducted to provide greater empirical evidence to support this finding.

AB  - Conceptual models are useful for facing the challenges of environmental sciences curriculum and course developers and students. These challenges are inherent to the interdisciplinary and problem-oriented character of environmental sciences curricula. In this article, we review the merits of conceptual models in facing these challenges. These models are valuable because they can be used to (a) improve the coherence and focus of an environmental sciences curriculum, (b) analyze environmental issues and integrate knowledge, (c) examine and guide the process of environmental research and problem solving, and (d) examine and guide the integration of knowledge in the environmental-research and problem-solving processes. We advocate the use of various conceptual models in environmental sciences education. By applying and reflecting on these models, students start to recognize the complexity of human-environment systems, to appreciate the various approaches to framing environmental problems, and to comprehend the role of science in dealing with these problems.

AB  - In this article we introduce a synthesis of education "paradigms," adapted from a multi-disciplinary body of literature and tailored to health professions education (HPE). Each paradigm involves a particular perspective on the purpose of education, the nature of knowledge, what knowledge is valued and included in the curriculum, what it means to learn and how learning is assessed, and the roles of teachers and learners in the learning process. We aim to foster awareness of how these different paradigms look in practice and to illustrate the importance of alignment between teaching, learning and assessment practices with paradigmatic values and assumptions. Finally, we advocate for a pluralistic approach that purposefully and meaningfully integrates paradigms of education, enhancing our ability to drive quality in HPE.

AB  - The development of STEAM education has captured researchers' attention due to its advantages for students' learning and interest in related subjects, specifically in kindergarten to grade 12 (K-12) educational settings. However, there is limited research on the inclusion of STEAM in higher education, and what university students think as they are on the professional training track. This study aimed to examine university students' attitudes towards STEAM via a 3D design project. Twenty-seven college students participated in this study. A questionnaire and focus group interviews were administered at the end of the course to uncover the students' learning enjoyment, conceptions of STEAM learning, and intentions of STEAM future design/ work involvement. The results show that the students enjoyed the 3D STEAM project regardless of their performance. High-performance students had higher conceptions of STEAM learning after the project. All of the students highly agreed that they could integrate interdisciplinary knowledge into their 3D designs. With regard to future intentions, they generally did not show an active attitude towards STEAM involvement. The students' learning enjoyment in the STEAM project did not have a strong positive correlation with their future intentions. Findings from this study could offer inspiration for artoriented courses that look for potential interdisciplinary integration and expression in STEAM.

AB  - Background: Although sound is an everyday phenomenon that we hear about constantly, numerous studies have reported that students often exhibit learning difficulties in understanding this subject. Only a few studies have proposed programs involving practical learning experiments to provide students with solid conceptual knowledge. Moreover, little research to date has dealt with the topic of sound from the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) perspective. Purpose: The need for this research is rooted in the general lack of learning materials developed according to integrative STEM and in the shortage of interdisciplinary contents that specifically address the subject of sound. The Sound, Waves and Communication Systems (SWCS) program was developed in Sakhnin in Israel to integrate the learning of science and technology through the extensive use of Information and Computer Technologies (ICT). The study aimed at exploring middle school students' achievements and motivation in learning the program and discovering the factors that might affect these elements. Sample: The participants in the study are 120 middle school students (7th-graders), divided into six separate groups: two groups (40 students) participated in the pilot study, whereas four groups (80 students) took part in the main study. Methods: The study adopted a mixed method research design, and combined quantitative and qualitative methods that included observations in class, administering a students' motivation questionnaire before and after studying the course, giving achievement exams, and analyzing the students' projects. Results: The findings showed that despite difficulties in learning the subject, the students eventually managed to gain a conceptual understanding and their self-efficacy significantly increased. Conclusions: The flexible integration of the teachers' instruction, the hands-on lab work, the use of ICT, and project-based learning all contributed to the participants' success and motivation in learning the current course.

AB  - Both in physics education and in science education more generally concerns exist that formal K-12 education structures limit and, in some cases, diminish students' interest and agency in these fields. Many stakeholders have turned to informal learning experiences as a means to inspire young people to pursue continual learning in these fields in ways that foster creativity and self-determination. While research exists on the effect of these informal science experiences on students' science identities and broader science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) identities, little is known about how specific informal science education experiences relate to students' "physics identity"--a construct strongly associated with physics career choice. The current study contributes to the literature by examining the effect of several informal science experiences on students' physics identity. Drawing on data from a national survey administered to students in required English courses at 27 colleges and universities across the US (N=15 847), we used multiple regression to test the relationship between informal science experiences in various topical areas at two educational levels (K-8 and 9-12) and students' physics identity, while controlling for science background and demographics. The results reveal positive effects for stereotypic informal experiences in physical science (e.g., tinkering, competitions) as well as for talking science with friends or family. In addition, there were negative relationships between biology-related experiences (at both levels) and physics identity. Group comparisons further revealed that female students were more likely to report participating in biology-related activities and less likely to report participating in tinkering, STEM competitions, and talking science with friends or family. Students who identified themselves as Black or Hispanic were also less likely than those of other racial or ethnic groups to report tinkering and talking science with friends or family. We use this evidence to build the case that informal learning experiences in physics should move beyond stereotypic activities, increase accessibility, facilitate discourse with family or friends, and focus on interdisciplinary experiences that better engage young participants with a wide range of interests that are connected to physics.

AB  - This study investigated the implementation of best teaching practices by science graduate teaching assistants [GTAs] (3 chemists and 2 biologists) in five inquiry-based, interdisciplinary chemistry-biology experiments during a six-week professional development (PD) program, Engage PD. Additionally, we examined GTAs' experiences in implementing specific PD aspects. The PD program took place as the GTAs taught sections of biology and chemistry laboratory courses, each comprising five interdisciplinary experiments. The PD aspects included defining expected learning outcomes, subject-matter knowledge, relevance to real-world and chemistry-biology connections, and other active classroom teaching practices. Data were collected through classroom observations, reflection questionnaires, and individual interviews. Findings indicated that 57% of the PD aspects investigated were implemented in the five interdisciplinary experiments. Results also revealed GTAs' initial areas of struggle in implementing specific PD aspects. Perceived implementation difficulties were attributed to individual perceptions and beliefs, and contextual factors. Through practice, continuous feedback, and reflections, most GTAs overcame the hurdles and refined their teaching. Findings imply the need to design training PD programs that offer mentoring and support to GTAs and future faculty in implementing teaching innovations. The teaching context and reflection prompts are helpful in identifying areas of difficulties and how to improve.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the educational benefits and challenges of introducing natural science students to on-campus and off-campus sustainability research projects as an approach to education for sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: The course "Science and Sustainability" at the University of Leuven is a stand-alone course that aims at providing master students in the natural sciences, education for (the benefit of) sustainability action. It was launched in 2016-2017 and has been running for two years now. The first year focused on getting students acquire a similar level of knowledge in sustainability, while, on a higher level, the experiential learning phase (project work) was supported with specific reflection assignments. In the second year, more specific attention was directed toward allowing students to get acquainted with systems thinking and deal with inter- and transdisciplinary issues by approaching problems from a multi-stakeholder view. Insight in the impact and the appreciation of the setup of the course was obtained from a series of questionnaires offered to all participating students at the beginning, about midway, and again at the end of the course. Findings: Analysis of the students' self-reported sustainability competence development shows a clear positive impact for almost all students who participated. A clear relation between the observed change and the students' self-rating and attitude at the start, as well as with their discipline, is observed. Originality/value: Information is gained on a number of factors of importance to impact the students' attitude toward action for sustainability, and how this can be further improved.

AB  - This essay argues the importance of interdisciplinary, contemplative, place-based pedagogy. The Ecology and Colour in 1m[superscript 2] study has students from the sciences and the arts observe a small quadrat in their local community over several weeks, engaging in both scientific and creative expression. The connection to Aldo Leopold's teaching principles and its relevance during our current screen fatigue pandemic and increasing disconnection from the natural world are outlined. We review contemplative practice in relation to education, such as sit spots or "site-specific" learning. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the Ecology and Colour in 1m[superscript 2] study and aligned with Leopold's emphasis on fostering a personal connection with nature, our paper also includes three narratives and examples of student reflections and visual artwork created during this project.

AB  - Examining an interdisciplinary university course for architecture, wood science, and engineering students, this paper studies how the students' ability to master digital workflows influenced their success in learning collaborative design skills. It highlights potential challenges and opportunities posed by the introduction of new digital tools to support emerging integrated building design in both education and professional practice. The particular course focuses on the wood industry, which is rapidly changing from a very traditional to a highly innovative sector and increasingly embracing the latest technological developments in computational design, simulation, and digital fabrication. This study explores the influence of parametric design on collaboration dynamics and workflow within an interdisciplinary group of students embodying the roles of manufacturer, engineer, and architect. Student-generated data of the first three years of the class is analyzed thematically to find correlations with productive collaborations. Focusing on a stage of an evolving teaching and learning process, this analysis allows identifications of common themes and patterns, suggesting implications for practice and future research. The course highlights the need to integrate data interoperability, collaboration skill-building, and material awareness in contemporary digitally enabled architecture, engineering, and construction education. The lessons learned in this course can be of value to academic programs and professional firms involved in incorporating digital design and interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - This article presents results from a Scholarships in STEM (S-STEM) grant from the National Science Foundation that supported students from three majors and funded the development of cocurricular activities designed to increase the workforce development of first-generation and underrepresented students. Scholar cohorts were interdisciplinary, with students majoring in biology, chemistry, and environmental science. We present details from four categories of activities: library resources and information literacy, career services, professional development, and community engagement. We discuss how the process of designing the activities created collaborations between STEM faculty and student support staff and between faculty and regional employers and nonprofit organizations. Results from formative assessments are presented from the group of scholars as a whole, as we did not detect significant differences as a function of gender, first-generation status, race or ethnicity, or academic major. Overall, the community engagement events were rated more poorly than other activities because they were viewed as contributing less to gains of knowledge or skills. Finally, we found that how the scholars viewed the activities depended more on how we discussed the activities with them than on the scholars' academic or demographic features.

AB  - An increasingly important aim in education is to develop students capable of addressing complex, interdependent problems. This study integrates theories of situated learning, authentic science research, socioscientific issues, and interdisciplinary STEM education to construct a program for high school students. Drawn from Vygotsky and Dewey's philosophy of social constructivism, we developed a framework to incorporate situated learning, authentic science research, and socioscientific issues in fostering sustainable development competencies of systems thinking and problem-solving to provide opportunities for students to transition from newcomers to adaptive experts. Using qualitative methods, we explored the development of a systems thinking approach in problem-solving related to climate change and air pollution in fifty-seven international school students in Taiwan. We found patterns of (1) systems thinking application in innovative solutions, (2) understanding the practices of authentic science research, and (3) interconnections between science and society. The findings suggest the framework has relevance to high-value learning of systems thinking and for discussions of problem-solving in community contexts and future research directions.

AB  - Situated in the context of an in-service professional development (PD) program focused on Interdisciplinary Science Inquiry, this quantitative study tests the validity of and further explores the theoretical model adapted from Desimone's (2009), "Educational Researcher," 38, 181-199 conceptual framework on effectiveness of PD. The participants include 204 teachers and 5,581 students within 12 local public schools from 2012 to 2016. The multilevel models indicate that PD participation, school-, and teacher-level factors influence teacher pedagogical content knowledge and inquiry instruction in different ways. Furthermore, the inquiry instruction significantly relates student understanding of interdisciplinary science concepts (ISCs) through a few mediators. Therefore, this study reinforces calls to provide teachers with high quality PD and contributes to current knowledge base of the mechanisms of how inquiry instruction influences students' understanding of ISCs.

AB  - The aim of this study is to find out effects of science teaching through Science-Technology-Society [STT] approach on elementary school students' creative thinking skills, attitudes towards science lesson, and academic success. To this end, a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design without the control group was used among quantitative research models. The study participants were composed of 6 classroom teachers who had previously taken in-service training [IST] on STS approach and their students (N=273) selected through random sampling. Study data were collected by using the Creative Thinking Skills Scale (CTSS), Science and Technology Course Attitude Survey [STCAS], and Academic Achievement Test [AAT]. The data were analyzed by conducting one-way ANOVA test with SPSS. The results showed that the students in STT classes could improve their creative thinking skills, attitudes towards science course, and academic achievement compared to their peers in the classes. It can thus be useful to encourage teachers to perform teaching based on approaches addressing science-technology-society relation. As another recommendation, it is suggested to prepare professional development programs.

AB  - Purpose: We intent to provide a comprehensive picture of Hungarian social science education, to review the constituents of social science literacy, a systematic analysis of the curriculum and its changes since 1989 and of the available research in this field. Design/methodology/approach: The findings are based on the analysis of educational documents (e. g. curricula) and the review of the research publications in the field. Findings: Social science education is cross-curricular in Hungary. Among the different knowledge fields history has a decisive and dominant role. Other social science topics are mostly abandoned in everyday teaching practice. There is a growing centralization of the educational arena (e.g. government approved limited number of textbooks) and a growing emphasis on national identity and patriotism and a decreasing emphasis on Europe. The cross-curricular nature of social science education would require well trained teachers who are able to think critically and in a complex way themselves, however teacher training and classroom practice also support the hegemony of history teaching.

AB  - With the introduction of "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS"), teachers have been called to find meaningful and engaging ways to teach science content while incorporating engineering practices and, to a lesser extent, computing and computational thinking. The task becomes even more complex when they also have to integrate mathematics under the umbrella of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education. To be of high quality, this integration needs to be intentional and specific, with consideration given to both content and context (Bryan, Moore, Johnson, & Roehrig, 2015). This article describes an integrated STEM unit where students worked on a project requiring an interdisciplinary solution authentic to complex problems in the real world (English, King, & Smeed, 2016). It also highlights core features that supported disciplinary engagement, improved interdisciplinary learning, and increased awareness and interest in engineering specifically and STEM more broadly, with the goal of providing a framework to support engineering education as situated within the broader context of STEM learning.

AB  - The implementation of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) at school is one of the challenges of education in the twenty-first century, especially concerning the development of critical thinking during argumentative interactions. In this paper, I refer to an interdisciplinary approach with the aim to analyze the implicit inferential reasoning emerging in argumentative discussions among children during scientific activities. The study involved 25 preschool children at a kindergarten engaged in three problem solving tasks. The first activity was to build a tunnel, the second to build a bridge--both with the use of Lego©--and the third to build an hourglass with recycled materials. The tasks were video-recorded and the discussions transcribed. The analysis implied different steps: first, I identified the argumentative structure of each exchange according to the pragma-dialectical approach; then, I found the implicit premises using the Argumentum Model of Topics; afterward, I analyzed the argumentative discussions according to a sociocultural approach. The findings show a predominance of arguments based on causal relationships and indicate how children reason regarding complex aspects of a problem, such as the negative consequences of an action, the adequacy of the available tools, and the (possible) future conditions connected to the scientific activity they are involved in. The study opens a possibility to shift from how to implement STEM activities to what children already do when engaged in scientific tasks. It also encourages the adoption of an interdisciplinary approach to investigating the complex process of argumentation in preschool children.

AB  - Teaching in higher education poses unique sets of challenges, especially for academics in the engineering, built sciences and information science education disciplines. This article focuses on how reflective collaboration can support academics in their quest to find unique solutions to challenges in different academic contexts. A reflective collaboration framework was applied during a three-year interpretive research process at an Engineering, Information Technology and Built Environment Faculty in a residential research intensive university in South Africa. Interdisciplinary reflective collaboration was found to bring richness and depth into investigations of complex teaching challenges. This framework provides a structure to support the transformation of teaching challenges into learning opportunities through the promotion of dialogue, critique and reflection between engineering and education academics.

AB  - This book presents a wide range of international perspectives that explore the different ways the diverse forms of drama supports learning in science. It illustrates how learning science by adopting and adapting theatrical techniques can offer more inclusive ways for students to relate to scientific ideas and concepts. The theatrical processes by which subject matter can be introduced, thought about, discussed, transformed, enacted and disseminated are shown to be endless. The first section of the book considers different ways of theorising and applying drama in classrooms. The second section provides a range of case studies illustrating how role play, performance, embodiment and enquiry approaches can be utilised for learning in primary, secondary and tertiary education contexts. The third section demonstrates how different research methods from questionnaires, particular kinds of tests and even the theatrical conventions themselves can provide rich data that informs how drama impacts on learning science.

AB  - In recent years, with the popularity of AI technologies in our everyday life, researchers have begun to discuss an emerging term "AI literacy". However, there is a lack of review to understand how AI teaching and learning (AITL) research looks like over the past two decades to provide the research basis for AI literacy education. To summarize the empirical findings from the literature, this systematic literature review conducts a thematic and content analysis of 49 publications from 2000 to 2020 to pave the way for recent AI literacy education. The related pedagogical models, teaching tools and challenges identified help set the stage for today's AI literacy. The results show that AITL focused more on computer science education at the university level before 2021. Teaching AI had not become popular in K-12 classrooms at that time due to a lack of age-appropriate teaching tools for scaffolding support. However, the pedagogies learnt from the review are valuable for educators to reflect how they should develop students' AI literacy today. Educators have adopted collaborative project-based learning approaches, featuring activities like software development, problem-solving, tinkering with robots, and using game elements. However, most of the activities require programming prerequisites and are not ready to scaffold students' AI understandings. With suitable teaching tools and pedagogical support in recent years, teaching AI shifts from technology-oriented to interdisciplinary design. Moreover, global initiatives have started to include AI literacy in the latest educational standards and strategic initiatives. These findings provide a research foundation to inform educators and researchers the growth of AI literacy education that can help them to design pedagogical strategies and curricula that use suitable technologies to better prepare students to become responsible educated citizens for today's growing AI economy.

AB  - This paper discusses investigations in science education addressing the nonlinear dynamical hypothesis. Learning science is a suitable field for applying interdisciplinary research and predominately for testing psychological theories. It was demonstrated that in this area the paradigm of complexity and nonlinear dynamics have offered theoretical advances and better interpretations of empirical data. Research showed that besides linear modes of behavior, sudden transitions occur in cognitive performance and this has questioned basic theoretical and epistemological assumptions. The neo-Piagetian framework and motivational theories offering constructs for serving as predictors in various model are the local theories which are embraced by the CDS meta-theory. Sudden transitions are modeled by catastrophe theory (CT) the analyses of which reveal the crucial role of certain variables, namely the bifurcation factors. Beyond a critical value of the bifurcation factor, the state variable splits into two-attractor regions and becomes bimodal. The bifurcation effect induces uncertainty and unpredictability in the system, which oscillates between two states entering the regime of chaos. Then in state variables such as learning outcomes and achievement, sudden transitions from success to failure are expected. Catastrophe theory explains unexpected phenomena associated with school failure, dropouts, illicit behaviors, sudden attitude change, and creativity. Moreover CT could contribute in elucidating theoretical debates and conflicting empirical evidences.

AB  - The goal of this case study was to examine how a group of young children in a historically marginalized neighborhood in the northern part of the Netherlands perceived their engagement in an out-of-school, STEM community-based program aiming to enhance young children's interest and self-identification with science. We collected data through semi-structured interviews with eight purposefully selected children and analyzed those through a constant comparative approach and with the use of open coding strategies. The findings revealed specific aspects of the design of the program that were perceived as motivating and engaging: the integrated multidisciplinary approach to exploring scientific concepts and opportunities for active engagement and personally relevant science experimentation. The findings are offered alongside a set of recommendations for the design of out-of-school, community-based programs that aim to support young children's engagement with science.

AB  - One SENCER ideal is to connect science education and civic engagement by student learning through complex, unresolved public issues. Using this approach, we established a collaborative interdisciplinary project involving faculty and undergraduate students at NYC College of Technology. Over several semesters, students conducted literature search and discovered the complex factors contributing to the occurrence and transmission of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Using microbiology data from 15 hospitals in Brooklyn, NY, they applied statistical analyses, studied the antibiotic resistance, and developed a campaign to bring more awareness of this problem. The results of the project highlight the importance of immediate action in combating HAIs and support the need for a public health campaign. Undergraduate students were provided with the opportunity to conduct research, perform scientific and mathematical analyses, and present their results. They gained better understanding of the complex interactions among microbiology, epidemiology, and mathematics that is needed to develop preventative measures and combat HAIs.

AB  - This article outlines the 'Big Ideas' approach to curriculum reform, as applied in the 'Principles and Big Ideas of Science Education' project. A critical analysis follows of the outcomes of the University of Exeter's 'Identifying Principles and Big Ideas for Religious Education' project, which sought to apply the same approach to Religious Education (RE) in English schools. This project made great headway in generating 'Big Ideas' to inform and improve the selection and sequencing of RE curriculum content. However, its primary focus on subject content knowledge means that 'Big Ideas' about epistemology and methodology are lacking. The article recommends an additional focus on multi-disciplinary, multi-methodological, inquiry-based, reflexive learning, which would ask why, how, where and by whom our 'knowledge' of religion(s) and worldview(s) is generated. In this regard, the article posits four 'Big Ideas about the study of religion(s) and worldview(s)' to highlight the symbiotic relationship between knowledge and knower, and to reject the false dichotomy between the object of study and method of study. In so doing, it draws upon the theoretical framework underpinning the 'RE-searchers approach' to primary school RE, which correspondingly exemplifies how such ideas can be taught in practice.

AB  - This article aims to investigate environmental education in preschools by taking Donna Haraway's call of "staying with the trouble" together with preschool children seriously, here-and-now, in explorations of dirty water and water purification. This posthumanist inspired research project draws theoretically and methodologically on the writings of Haraway, Anna L. Tsing and Isabelle Stengers. The empirical data consist of three stories from a multidisciplinary intervention research project in the Stockholm region in Sweden, collected from collaboratively produced data such as films, photographs, drawings, and notes from the project. The study can be seen as an invitation to preschools to engage in the debate on climate change and to create a togetherness around environmental concerns, not only in the future, but also here-and-now in the preschool.

AB  - Recent reforms in science education have supported the inclusion of engineering and their practices in K-12 curricula. To this end, many classrooms have incorporated engineering units that include design challenges. Design is an integral part of engineering and can help students think in creative and interdisciplinary ways. In this study, we examined students' conceptions of design during and after participation in a design-based science curriculum unit. Our study was guided by the following research question: What are students' views of design after participation in an engineering design-based science curriculum unit and how are these views reflected in their enactment throughout the unit? Using a qualitative approach, we examined students' conversations throughout the enactment of the curriculum and interviews conducted after the completion of the unit. We found that students had complex and diverse views of design, and these views were reflected in their group discussions throughout the curriculum and design challenge. Students most frequently expressed design as learning and as a process of integration into a coherent whole. These aspects of design were also frequently observed in students' conversations during the unit. Interestingly, we found evidence of students demonstrating several aspects of design throughout the curriculum that were not explicitly expressed during the student interviews. Taken together, these findings support the complex nature of design as seen at the middle school level.

AB  - This study aims to examine the effects of the "Unlocking Research & Innovative Capability" program for university teachers. A total of 80 teachers from the Abai Kazakh National Pedagogical University were enrolled. All participants were divided into groups based on their age and teaching experience. Data were collected via surveys. The proposed program was found to have different effects across groups. Young university teachers (28 to 35 years; teaching experience, 3 to 5 years) exhibited improvement in all research and innovative capability variables, ranging from 0.84 in Interdisciplinary Cooperation to 2.63 in Innovative Teaching. The same is true for early middle-aged university teachers (36 to 45 years; teaching experience, 5 to 10 years) who showed improvement ranging from 1.52 in Interdisciplinary Cooperation to 3.00 in Integration of Technology. Older middle-aged university teachers (46 to 55 years; teaching experience, 10 to 20 years) exhibited improvement in their Innovative Teaching, Research Practice, and Integration of Technology; yet, it did not exceed 1.85 points. Older university teachers (older than 56 years; teaching experience, 20 years) demonstrated minimal improvement in all dimensions. This study was conducted as part of governmental research on "Managing the Development of Research & Innovative Capability in the Research University Staff under the Participatory Management Model" launched by the RK Ministry of Education and Science (Project number: AR14872123). The study emphasizes the importance of empowering university teachers as key drivers of research, knowledge generation, and innovative teaching. The present findings can be used to cultivate a culture of innovation and research in academic institutions.

AB  - Facilitating successful informal STEM learning experiences is essential for building knowledge and comfort with STEM content for children and teachers alike. Informal learning experiences are by nature hands-on and interdisciplinary and provide play-based, real-world, authentic learning experiences. This article describes what elementary teacher candidates learn about teaching science from facilitating a STEM event within school settings and outside regular school hours. The article also presents implications for elementary-teacher education.

AB  - This study investigated the interaction of disciplinary and interdisciplinary learning in a team-taught, first-year, interdisciplinary sustainability course. We surveyed (pre/post) both STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and non-STEM majors (N = 241), assessing attitudes and content knowledge. Responses were analyzed using factor analysis, classical test theory, and Rasch analysis. Multivariate analyses of variance were performed to look for pre/post differences and differences between groups. Confirmatory factor analysis verified that the content knowledge items adequately assessed disciplinary and interdisciplinary understanding separately. Tests indicated an adequate item difficulty range, but also a need for more items at the higher end. All groups improved significantly over the semester. Slightly higher gains for STEM students and a correlation between disciplinary, and interdisciplinary learning might indicate a possible benefit of "disciplinary grounding." The instrument vetted through this study expands the number of validated sustainability content knowledge items. Further, it allows users to probe content knowledge along both interdisciplinary and disciplinary dimensions.

AB  - Western science has grown increasingly reductionistic and, in parallel, the undergraduate life sciences curriculum has become disciplinarily fragmented. While reductionistic approaches have led to landmark discoveries, many of the most exciting scientific advances in the late 20th century have occurred at disciplinary interfaces; work at these interfaces is necessary to manage the world's looming problems, particularly those that are rooted in cellular-level processes but have ecosystem- and even global-scale ramifications (e.g., nonsustainable agriculture, emerging infectious diseases). Managing such problems requires comprehending whole scenarios and their emergent properties as sums of their multiple facets and complex interrelationships, which usually integrate several disciplines across multiple scales (e.g., time, organization, space). This essay discusses bringing interdisciplinarity into undergraduate cellular biology courses through the use of multiscalar topics. Discussing how cellular-level processes impact large-scale phenomena makes them relevant to everyday life and unites diverse disciplines (e.g., sociology, cell biology, physics) as facets of a single system or problem, emphasizing their connections to core concepts in biology. I provide specific examples of multiscalar topics and discuss preliminary evidence that using such topics may increase students' understanding of the cell's position within an ecosystem and how cellular biology interfaces with other disciplines.

AB  - As an emerging field of theory, research, and practice, STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) has received attention for its efforts to incorporate the arts into the rubric of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) learning. In particular, many informal educators have embraced it as an inclusive and authentic approach to engaging young people with STEM. Yet, as with many nascent fields, the conceptualization and usage of STEAM is somewhat ambivalent and weakly theorized. On the one hand, STEAM offers significant promise through its focus on multiple ways of knowing and new pathways to equitable learning. On the other hand, it is often deployed in theory, pedagogy, and practice in ambiguous or potentially problematic ways toward varying ends. This paper attempts to disentangle some of the key tensions and contradictions of the STEAM concept as currently operationalized in educational research, policy, and practice. We pay particular attention to the transformative learning potential supported by contexts where STEAM is conceptualized as both pedagogical and mutually instrumental. That is, neither STEM nor arts are privileged over the other, but both are equally in play. We link the possibilities suggested by this approach to emerging theories for understanding how designing for and surfacing epistemic practices linked to the relevant disciplines being integrated into STEAM programs may point the way toward resolving tensions in inter- and transdisciplinary learning approaches.

AB  - This research contributes to the growing discussion on entrepreneurial competencies from a multidisciplinary point of view, integrating elements of entrepreneurship research, education sciences, and psychology. Despite many efforts to develop and utilize different entrepreneurial constructs in entrepreneurship education, there is still a lack of theoretical framework for systematic development and measurement validation related to entrepreneurial competencies. This paper aims to widen the theoretical and conceptual discussion on entrepreneurial competencies by stressing the roles of self-esteem and self-efficacy. The study aims to contribute to the academic discussion (1) by addressing this research gap through a literature-based analysis on how entrepreneurial competencies, self-efficacy and self-esteem relate to each other; and (2) by presenting a conceptual framework (ENTself) for further development of entrepreneurship education. The results of the study reflect how self-esteem and self-efficacy are connected, and how they can be aligned with entrepreneurial competencies. We argue that a systematic, theory-based approach to further research on entrepreneurial competencies, based on the proposed framework, is needed for a broader understanding and facilitation of entrepreneurship education. Also, the development of assessment tools adapted from ENTself is suggested for conducting future research of the framework and its validation.

AB  - At the end of 20th century and especially in this century the education field is undergoing a significant change not only as a result of technological innovations but also pedagogical innovations on the bases of artificial intelligence (AI), cognitive science and neuroscience. What interested us was the attitude of students and teachers towards these changes. In the research the participating students were arranged in two groups, the control group (CG), where conventional lessons were carried out and the experimental group (EG), in which teachers used a transdisciplinary cognitive neuroeducation model. The performance data for the both groups was acquired via questionnaire adopted from TIMSS research. The teachers' attitude towards these changes was mostly monitored via qualitative research. As is apparent from the results, a positive shift can be seen in the students' attitude towards school. And this positive attitude towards school can create in students the suitable motivation, which is the first and most important step towards quality knowledge. A positive shift was also made in the minds of the teachers.

AB  - The role of anatomy in modern curricula is under reform due to competency of other rapidly evolving subjects and the rapid evolution of several practical aspects and applications dictating modernization of teaching methods as well as of teaching demands. Moreover, modern practice of medicine has put the arterial and vascular system in the center of numerous minimally invasive techniques. Therefore, regardless of their specialty, most doctors should have a very clear and precise knowledge of the vascular anatomy and the basic access techniques from the early years. This viewpoint commentary reflects the experience of the two authors in applying the principles and content of surgical vascular anatomy in undergraduate anatomy teaching and discusses the rationale of this. Moreover, it is suggested that cadaveric dissections should be modified with emphasis on standard surgical vascular exposures and the multidisciplinary teaching of vascular anatomy as a means not only to gain optimal long-term knowledge retention, but also to emphasize through realistic examples on the practical clinical value of vascular anatomy.

AB  - Current visions for the education of young people propose learning in meaningful contexts, relevant for citizens of a modern society. Inquiry-based teaching is one such approach in science education, but its potential can best be realised through constructive collaboration between teachers and across subjects. This chapter presents a case of school-based development resulting in a major cross-curricular technology project. It shows how inquiry can form part of a creative process where students design and build technological products of high quality and how this reflects authentic inquiry in science. The teaching project is run by teachers at a lower secondary school in Norway, where students in Grade 9 (age 14-15) spend 2 entire weeks combining a range of subjects in designing and building individual car models. Project authenticity is achieved by allowing for students' creativity, setting high expectations for product quality and providing enough time for students to participate in creative inquiry processes. Based on this case, it is argued that inquiry-based teaching calls for autonomy for schools and teachers just as meaningful inquiry learning requires a certain level of autonomy for learners. The success of the project is discussed in terms of how it represents an exception to normal curriculum structure, adopts alternative standards and reallocates resources in order to achieve goals set by the school. These goals transcend the narrower goals of the formal curriculum for school subjects and contribute to combating current trends of increased rigidity and narrow focus on testable knowledge in schools.

AB  - Environmental science classes often ask students to examine changes in species or their environments to determine the human impact on a particular habitat or ecosystem. It is not always practical to take students out for a field study to do this kind of analysis; instead, the scientific method and diversity analyses can be utilized while students compare topographic maps, photographs, or paintings over time. In this article, we present three laboratories that use artwork (e.g., paintings or photographs) to have students examine anthropogenic alterations in the character of landscapes and explore how our connection with nature has changed over time. These laboratories can benefit educators looking for an interdisciplinary STEAM approach to introduce both biology majors and nonmajors to environmental science concepts and the scientific method in a highly relatable way.

AB  - Student engagement is a central concept for educational practitioners, researchers, and evaluators, especially working with learners historically minoritised in science developing their self-efficacy. Design-oriented projects in invention education show potential for promoting equitable engagement, partly by building upon learners' sociocultural backgrounds and experiences. However, the relationship between more social and more individual conceptions of student engagement is not yet well understood. We took a cultural psychology approach to design-based research for planning, implementing, and analysing a five-day camp in the Northeast US, wherein grades 6-8 students invented an electronic door and a free-choice invention. Our mixed-methods case study for convergence revealed some statistically significant changes in engagement and self-efficacy for inventing, which qualitative analyses suggest were related to campers' cognitive self-efficacy for ability with technology, campers' perceived agency for inter- and trans-disciplinary approaches to inventing, and the camp's social infrastructure for student participation. Further, we found evidence differentiating individual and social levels of affective/emotional, behavioural, and cognitive engagement, supporting a six-part model over previous three- and four-part models. We conclude with conjectures about the camp's enactment, learning processes, and outcomes, providing an educational model that could be useful in designing similar environments for user- or activity-centred design projects.

AB  - The COVID-19 global pandemic significantly impacted both the academic and social and emotional development of middle school students. This article describes the benefits of implementing an interdisciplinary, project-based summer school program to support middle school students as they adapted to in-person learning after school closures due to the global pandemic. Findings show that participation in the summer program contributed to students' engagement and interest in science and engineering activities and their social-emotional growth through peer collaboration and relational mentor support.

AB  - This article discusses problems of reconstructing the recent development in the field of empirical research on education ("empirische Bildungsforschung"), especially problems resulting from its interdisciplinary character, its divergent institutional contexts and its multimethod approach. The article looks at the position of various disciplines--in particular, science of education ("Erziehungswissenschaft") and educational psychology--involved in research on education as an interdisciplinary field of study. Compared to previous times, important shifts concerning the relation between these two disciplines can currently be observed. The argument is about the notion of competence, about the right to define success criteria and about resources. Finally, this discussion focusing on Germany is then placed in the wider context of different cognitive and institutional forms of doing and organizing education studies and research in different countries.

AB  - As change agents at our university, we sought to facilitate a transition within our STEM college toward more extensive use of evidence-based instructional practices (EBIPs) that promote student-centered learning. We sought a multifaceted approach for this challenge, with the goal of achieving lasting change among the faculty, resulting in the creation of the STEM Faculty Institute (STEMFI). Supported by multiyear funding from the National Science Foundation, STEMFI provides instruction on EBIPs through a summer workshop, along with yearlong support in redesigning curriculum through one-to-one mentoring of each faculty participant. The first cohort of STEMFI participants has been successful, with most faculty showing significant shifts toward more student-centered practices in their teaching. Feedback on the post-workshop survey indicated participants considered the material helpful and engaging, encouraging a shift in their attitudes toward supporting EBIPs in their own classrooms. This article describes factors critical to the STEMFI approach and reports on the initial effectiveness observed.

AB  - Nowadays, the rapid spread of the interdisciplinary approach contributes to the development of disciplines and scientific developments in many ways. Therefore, how the interdisciplinary approach is addressed in the studies carried out is important in terms of guiding other studies. For this purpose, an attempt to determine how 155 doctorate theses which were written in science departments at a university located in Turkey's south between 2010-2016 addressed the study discipline, subject of study and interdisciplinary approach process was made in this study. Furthermore, the opinions of instructors working in these departments on the interdisciplinary approach were also examined. As a result of the study, it was seen that 140 theses were written with the disciplinary approach, 15 theses were written with the interdisciplinary approach, and they were also associated with economics, sociology, psychology and geography among social science disciplines. The facts that the concept of interdisciplinary is not exactly known and that the necessary conditions for studying have not been provided, the lack of time, the presence of gaps in disciplines and failure to ensure the adequate cooperation are important reasons for the limited number of studies carried out with the interdisciplinary approach. Therefore, it is important to promote interdisciplinary studies and to provide suitable conditions for studying.

AB  - There is widespread misuse of statistics in research, particularly in the life sciences, which is one of the contributing factors to reproducibility concerns in research. However, the formal quantitative training that life sciences research trainees receive is often quite limited. Our survey of statistics requirements in undergraduate life sciences programmes offered by the top research-intensive universities in Canada, the U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities, confirmed that training in statistics tends to be limited and more general in nature. To help raise awareness and address these limitations, this paper shares findings of this statistics requirements survey and describes the evidence-based framework for a second-year undergraduate course at the University of Toronto, which was introduced to integrate statistics instruction with the life sciences research process. We hope these insights will inform future quantitative course offerings, and ultimately, better prepare students to effectively engage with statistics in life sciences research.

AB  - The article presents the application of 3D technologies in STEAM education through a conducted scientific research, highlighting the role of 3D modeling and 3D printing as an innovative approach in achieving an interdisciplinary learning model. The research included the following stages: preparation for designing a detailed 3D steam locomotive model; analysis of process difficulties; giving students and lecturers the opportunity to perform a specific modeling task, using basic primitives from solid geometry, as well as a questionnaire to analyze and evaluate the skills and knowledge of the participants in the 3D modeling field. In this context, the preparation process of a 3D steam locomotive model for educational purposes, using Autodesk 3ds Max software, is presented, and the 3D printing technology FDM is examined. We issued a challenge to the participants in the research to design a non-complex 3D model, using unfamiliar 3D modeling software Blender, within a limited time. The questionnaire covered topics in education, science, art, STEAM, and 3D modeling. The goal is to showcase the role of the integration of 3D technologies in educational environments with the idea of developing key skills and knowledge in learners.

AB  - Since educational design research (EDR) was introduced to educational research at the beginning of the 1990s, it has gained recognition as a promising research approach that bridges the gap between research and practice in education. This paper aims to investigate how EDR has been utilised and developed and which challenges it has faced by systematically reviewing 21 Finnish EDR doctoral dissertations on mathematics, science, and technology education published between January 2000 and October 2018. The findings indicate that all dissertations yielded practical and theoretical contributions. Moreover, common EDR characteristics, including the use of educational problems in practice as a point of departure, research in real-world settings, evolution through an iterative process, development of practical interventions, and refinement of theoretical knowledge, were found in all dissertations. Most of the doctoral researchers were confronted with challenges, such as high demand for EDR with limited resources and difficulties associated with multidisciplinary teamwork. However, the dissertations were diverse in terms of research contexts, practical educational problems, research outcomes, research methodologies, scale, and collaboration. This systematic review not only enhances the understanding of the utilisation, development, and challenges of EDR but also provides implications for future EDR.

AB  - Recent calls for reform in K-12 science education and the National Academy of Engineering's Grand Challenges for Engineering in the 21st Century emphasize improving science teaching, students' engagement, and learning. In this study, we designed and implemented a curriculum unit for sixth-grade students (i = 1305). The curriculum unit integrated science and engineering content and practices to teach ecology, water pollution, and engineering design. We investigated the designed integrated STEM unit's effectiveness in students' science learning outcomes on pre-, post-, and delayed post-assessments. We collected pre-and post-assessment data of students' science learning outcomes for both the baseline group (taught via existing district-adopted curriculum) and an intervention group (taught with integrated life science and engineering curriculum). We used a quasi-experimental research design and examined differences between baseline and intervention groups. We used ANCOVA to explore differences in students' learning in baseline and intervention groups. Furthermore, for students in the intervention group, we conducted repeated-measures ANOVA to investigate knowledge retention. Our analyses also accounted for students' gender and People of Color (POC) status. We conducted multiple regression analyses to explore the relationship between students' gender, POC status, and their learning outcomes. The results indicated that the intervention group students performed significantly better than the students in the baseline group. The repeated measures ANOVA showed that students in the intervention group retained science knowledge after 8 weeks of instruction. Finally, the regression analysis for the baseline group showed that gender and POC status were not significant predictors of their post-assessment scores. However, POC status was a significant predictor of post-assessment scores and knowledge retention for the intervention group. Overall, this study provides valuable findings on how an integrated STEM curriculum designed with engineering design and practices improves students' science learning outcomes.

AB  - The "General-to-Vocational Student Roughly Equivalent" policy is an integral part of the top-level design of China's vocational education. The paper analyzed the value of the policy from a multidisciplinary perspective and reviewed its development path. According to the statistical analysis of the "General-to-Vocational Student Ratio (GVR)" data from 2009 to 2018, it can be seen that the policy has been implemented well. Still, the GVR has a trend of further expansion. Therefore, to ensure the effective implementation of this policy, relevant policy recommendations are put forward from stakeholders such as the government, secondary vocational schools, and parents of students.

AB  - Game jams are intensive events focusing on creation. Their popularity and visibility have soared in recent years. The phenomenon has attracted the attention of scholars interested in education and learning, and the potential of game jams has been studied in various ways. Increasingly, game jams have come to be viewed as a site for learning. They are seen as activities for developing technical skills needed for digital game development, developing so-called soft skills such as collaboration and communication skills and as a way to teach and learn science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics (STEAM) skills. In this article, the educational aspects of game jams are explored from multidisciplinary points of view. Combining education science, design research, and game studies, the authors position game jamming at the intersection of these disciplines to explore its various learning dimensions. This positioning provides a starting point for future studies of game jamming in the context of learning and teaching and invites discussion from diverse fields of study.

AB  - In pursuit of more mindful notions of hybridity, this review essay provides a series of reflections on Mathew Weinstein's representations of Street Medics and "sciences for the red zones of neoliberalism". My analysis draws on three popular ways of thinking with boundaries to offer a critical reading of the boundary-work that the essay performs with respect to three dialectics: (1) technical and political; (2) disciplinarily and multidisciplinarities; and (3) structures and agencies. I conclude with reflections on my boundary labour as a researcher, writer and pedagogue and how such cultural work might learn to live better with difference, ambiguities, hybrids and cross-hybrid learning.

AB  - Background and Context: Computational Thinking (CT) has been recently integrated into new and revised Digital Technologies content (DTC) in the Technology learning area of the New Zealand School Curriculum. Objective: To aid this change, this research examined how CT supports learning outcomes in both music and programming with the Sonic Pi platform. Method: A mixed-methods case study designed by the researcher was developed and trialled in a regular middle school classroom. The design of instruments and analysis utilised a widely used CT assessment framework at a school level. Findings: Many successes and challenges not reported in the literature on how CT can support learning outcomes in music and programming were revealed. Implications: Provided some significant limitations are considered, the major implication of the results suggest educators can use Sonic Pi to support many learning outcomes in music and programming for interested students.

AB  - Contribution: A novel proactive and collaborative learning paradigm was proposed to engage learners with different backgrounds and enable effective retention and transfer of the multidisciplinary artificial intelligence (AI)-cybersecurity knowledge. Specifically, the proposed learning paradigm contains: 1) an immersive learning environment to motivate the students for exploring AI/ machine learning (ML) development in the context of real-world cybersecurity scenarios by constructing learning models with tangible objects and 2) a proactive education paradigm designed with the use of collaborative learning activities based on game-based learning and social constructivism. Background: Increasing evidence shows that AI techniques can be manipulated, evaded, and misled, which can result in new and profound security implications. There is an education and training gap to foster a qualified cyber-workforce that understands the usefulness, limitations, and best practices of AI technologies in the cybersecurity domain. Efforts have been made to incorporate a comprehensive curriculum to meet the demand. There still remain essential challenges for effectively educating students on the interaction of AI and cybersecurity. Intended Outcomes: A novel proactive and collaborative learning paradigm is proposed to educate and train a qualified cyber-workforce in this new era where security breaches, privacy violations, and AI have become commonplace. Application Design: The development of this learning paradigm is grounded in the pedagogical approaches of technology-mediated learning and social constructivism. Findings: Although the research work is still ongoing, the prototype learning paradigm has shown encouraging results in promoting the learners' engagement in applied AI learning.

AB  - We propose an innovative approach to teaching friction. Our approach aims to educate students on its microscopic nature by highlighting its origin in intermolecular interactions. We have designed a teaching sequence (TS) based on a set of experimental investigations of the properties of a gecko-inspired tape at different length scales. The TS has been conceived to unravel the peculiar behavior of this man-made, commercially available biomimetic material and to train students to identify the connection between the micrometer-scale patterning and the peculiar tribological properties. Specifically, our approach compares friction (and adhesion) to wetting, occurring at solid/solid and solid/liquid interfaces, respectively. The aim is to scaffold a correct mental model of real interfaces and disclose the common origin of both phenomena in intermolecular interactions. The TS has been devised according to the design-based research scheme and it was inspired by the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE) and the 5E paradigms. It has been tested and tuned with students at level 3 in the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), during several on-campus stages. We report here the details and results of pre- and post-tests, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, we measure success in terms of the students' comprehension of the link between contact area and friction and of the role of intermolecular forces. We are confident that the learning experience with our TS will lead students to recognize the enormous potential impact of surface patterning in technological applications, in a curiosity-driven manner that will likely result in students' interest in quantitative studies of science and technology.

AB  - The complex nature of contemporary challenges requires a culture of cooperation between academic disciplines. However, to what extent do educational systems prepare students to think beyond the boundaries of austerely defined and often entrenched academic fields? UNESCO has successively called for Environmental Education, Education for Sustainable Development, and Education for Global Citizenship to incorporate complex socio-environmental issues into mainstream education. Despite the presence of strong institutional support by governments and international organizations, the introduction of these interdisciplinary approaches into actual educational settings has been slow. With no intention to underestimate the pertinence and agency of strong political will in promoting educational change, we explore the presence of deeper, epistemological issues that may account for the generally slow progress of interdisciplinary pedagogies. To elaborate on this discussion, we focus on pragmatic solutions that can promote the integration of environmental, sustainability, and global citizenship education into the existing educational ethoi.

AB  - The advent of integrated multidisciplinary research has given rise to some of the most important breakthroughs of our time, but has also set significant challenges to the current educational paradigm. Current academic education often limits cross-discipline discussion, depends on close-ended problems, and restricts utilization of interdisciplinary methods. "Advanced Methods in Mathematical Programming" is a new course developed at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. We used MATLAB as the course platform, exploiting the software's high levels of abstraction and modularity to teach network analysis, signal processing, module-oriented design, and mathematical modeling to students of all disciplines. Enrollment included students from different disciplines ranging from computer science to psychology. In their final projects, students presented novel ways of approaching classic disciplinary problems.

AB  - Background: The technological age of the twenty-first century has witnessed an upsurge in the demand for STEM education. Early childhood STEM learning and teaching has sparked attention among researchers. Purpose: This study aims to provide a holistic review of current STEM research in Early Childhood Education (ECE). Sample: We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 129 articles on early STEM education published in educational journals via Web of Science. Design and methods: This study used VOSviewer to analyze and conduct a bibliometric analysis. Statistical analyses on publications included annual trends, grants, journals, publishers, research topic, publishing source, institutions, keywords, categories and classification, and researchers. Results: The review found that (1) The majority of early childhood STEM research was conducted in developed countries such as the United States, Turkey, and Australia. (2) Key STEM literature in ECE studies tended to fall into major clusters such as STEM education, Robotics, and Mindstorms. (3) STEM in ECE studies were frequently associated with psychology in ECE. Conclusion: The findings suggest a need for more multidisciplinary and cross-disciplinary studies on STEM research in ECE and advocate for the inclusion of the STEM research in ECE from broader geographical contexts.

AB  - This exploratory case study affirmed the merit of using science fiction-inspired story writing to help Saudi Arabian Grade 10 female students learn science. Recognizing that teacher-centered rote learning was not reaching her rural students in the western part of Riyadh Province, the female teacher in this case switched to the constructivist active learning pedagogy, especially story writing. The case study report reflects data from a teacher interview, classroom observations (n = 2), and a content analysis of students' (N = 25) two homework assignments. In the spirit of science fiction (SF), they were required to (a) demonstrate their science learning by weaving their imagination and personalities with the world of arthropods and writing a story that reflected the values and principles they aspired to spread in society and (b) answer the third conditional sentence question "What would you ask god for if you were a Crustacean?" A content analysis confirmed that students correctly used science facts while creatively and innovatively using their imagination to write stories reflective of their value systems. They valued identity, societal recognition, validation and respect, enduring friendships, dialogue and conversations, protection, and family. Regarding the God/Crustacean question, they wanted to be happy, at peace, safe, valued, respected, and have a clean place to live. The study confirmed the value of further investigating the use of the science fiction genre in Saudi science education and using writing to learn science.

AB  - Chemistry education research (CER) as a field is inherently interdisciplinary and has traditionally borrowed ideas, frameworks, and methodologies from other fields, such as anthropology, psychology, cognitive science, and science education more broadly. In this paper we encourage researchers to continue this tradition by utilizing the rich body of literature that exists outside of CER, specifically looking to communities interested in mathematics education and physics education to expand the research carried out in our field. Previous work situated in university-level mathematics and physics involves considerations and concerns shared by the chemistry education community, such as integrating conceptual and mathematical reasoning during problem solving. We also briefly discuss and draw attention to a recent ACS Symposium Series book, "It's Just Math: Research on Students' Understanding of Chemistry and Mathematics," that illustrates the rich area of inquiry at the interface of chemistry and mathematics. An overview of frameworks that have been productive for investigating students' mathematical reasoning in a chemistry context is provided, encouraging researchers to engage in work that crosses disciplinary boundaries and promotes discussion between experts from different fields.

AB  - Educating for sustainability has been a key principle underpinning the primary/middle undergraduate teacher education programme at an Australian University for the past decade. Educating for sustainability seeks to provide knowledge and understanding of the physical, biological, and human world, and involves students making decisions about a range of ethical, social, environmental and economic issues, and acting upon them. This study (a part of the ongoing evaluation of our courses) focuses on pre-service teachers (PSTs) who have selected a minor in science and mathematics. Participatory and inclusive learning processes, transdisciplinary collaborations, experiential learning, and the use of local environment and community as learning resources as outlined by Sterling (2001) have formed the basis of much of our practice to develop PSTs' confidence and competence to teach science. This paper explores one pedagogical practice, environmental pledges which the preservice teachers undertook for 15 weeks. The focus is on the impact that undertaking an environmental pledge has had on the personal and professional lives of two groups, first, four cohorts of final-year science and mathematics pathway PSTs, and second, a small group of early-career teachers who had completed the course in previous years. Data have been collected from final-year science and mathematics students and early-career teachers using ethnographic methods to provide insight into their experiences of using the pledge.

AB  - The compartmentalisation of distinct disciplines limits the opportunities for teachers to work in a collaborative multidisciplinary manner. Workshops such as 'Saviour Siblings' from the Epistemic Insight Initiative encourage students to consider big questions from different perspectives and thus provide a bridge between the religious education (RE) and science curricula at key stage 4 (ages 14-16). This article reports on a collaborative teaching intervention between science and RE lecturers on a secondary PGCE initial teacher education programme. Discussing big questions with their peers proved to develop trainee teachers' beliefs about the power and limitations of science and the value of considering a diverse range of disciplinary perspectives.

AB  - We consider the philosophical and pedagogical aspects of "man-labour" system and justify its interdisciplinarity. On the basis of results of scientific researches the need for an objective systematization and specialization in pedagogy is emphasized. Four areas of education sciences systematization, proposed by Z. Vyatrovsky are analyzed. Particular attention is paid to the problems of the dialectical relationship of labour pedagogy, labour psychology and vocational pedagogy in globalization and integration processes. In this context prognostic significance of research aimed at dynamic development of "man-labour" system in the information and technology community is revealed.

AB  - This project report presents a multidisciplinary Faculty Learning Community model to foster civic engagement in STEM classes. It focused on first-year Chemistry, Math, and Scientific Inquiry courses and incorporated Academic Service Learning in a project to build solar cell phone chargers for a school in Puerto Rico recovering from the effects of Hurricane Maria in 2017. The project provided hands-on experiences for the students, with the tangible outcome of building the solar chargers for people in need. Student engagement was measured through surveys and reflective assignments; the students responded positively to their work and their sense of fulfilling the St. John's University mission. The members of the Faculty Learning Community have engaged in ongoing collaborative relationships.

AB  - Background: The ongoing transformation of the interplay between human beings and nature calls for new ways of learning. Although established educational practices merging sciences and arts have been studied before, the focus has been mainly on science or technology-discipline-orientated aspects. More research is needed on the characteristics of learning that address nature and the biological through art-based practices. Methods: Utilizing a case study approach, a week-long multidisciplinary project developed around bioart-making, and implemented in a Finnish upper secondary school, was scrutinized. The main data consisted of transcribed participant interviews and textual and visual material from a project blog. The data were analyzed using qualitative theory-driven content analysis to describe and understand the cross-boundary processes and human-nature interactions taking place within the project. Findings: Bioart-making constituted as a boundary object bringing together different understandings of nature. Identification, coordination, reflection, and transformation processes on different levels emerged as a part of and as an outcome of bioart-making. In and through these, learners interacted with nature through intertwined events of material-experiential utilization, cognitive knowledge-building, emotional connecting, and philosophical reflection. Contribution: This paper advances the theoretical discussion on integrative art-based practices' potential, especially in relation to learning that addresses nature and the biological.

AB  - This article reports on a study investigating how computational essays can be used to help students in higher education STEM take up disciplinary epistemic agency--cognitive control and responsibility over one's own learning within the scientific disciplines. Computational essays are a genre of scientific writing that combine live, executable computer code with narrative text to present a computational model or analysis. The study took place across two contrasting university contexts: an interdisciplinary data science and modeling course at a large research university in the Midwestern United States, and a third-semester physics course at a large research university in Scandinavia. Over the course of a semester, computational essays were simultaneously and independently used in both courses, and comparable datasets of student artifacts and retrospective interviews were collected from both student populations. These data were analyzed using a framework that operationalized the construct of disciplinary epistemic agency across the dimensions of programming, inquiry, data analysis and modeling, and communication. Based on this analysis, we argue that computational essays can be a useful tool for fostering disciplinary epistemic agency within higher education science due to their combination of adaptability and disciplinary authenticity. However, we also argue that educational contexts, scaffolding, expectations, and student backgrounds can constrain and influence the ways in which students choose to take up epistemic agency.

AB  - To understand how integrated science education (ISE) can be transferred into successful classroom practices, it is important to understand teachers' perceptions and self-efficacy. The focus of this study is twofold: (1) to understand how teachers perceive ISE and (2) to assess if science teachers' perceptions of and experiences with integrated education correlate with their views on self-efficacy in relation to ISE. Ninety-five Finnish science teachers participated in an online survey study. A mixed method approach via exploratory factor analysis and data-driven content analysis was used. Self-efficacy emerged as a key factor explaining teachers' perceptions of and their lack of confidence in implementing ISE as well as their need for support. In addition, teachers regarded ISE as a relevant teaching method, but challenging to implement, and teachers primarily applied integrated approaches irregularly and seldom. Furthermore, teachers' experiences with integrated activities and collaboration correlated with their views on integrated education and self-efficacy. These findings indicate teachers need support to better understand and implement ISE.

AB  - Drawn from the cultural-historical theories of knowing and doing science, this article uses the concept of professional vision to explore what scientists and experienced teachers see and articulate as important aspects of climate science practices. The study takes an abductive reasoning approach to analyze scientists' videotaped lectures to recognize what scientists pay attention to in their explanations of climate science practices. It then analyzes how ideas scientists attended align with experienced teachers' sense-making of scientific practices to teach climate change. The findings show that experienced teachers' and scientists' explanations showed alignment in the focus on scientific practices, but indicated variations in the temporal and spatial reasoning of climate data. Furthermore, the interdisciplinarity of climate science was emphasized in climate scientists' lectures, but was not apparent once scientists and teachers shared the same culture in meetings to provide feedback to preservice teachers. Given the importance of teaching through scientific practices in classrooms, this study provides suggestions to capture the epistemic diversity of scientific disciplines.

AB  - Aim/Purpose: This study was aimed at enhancing students' learning of software engineering methods. A collaboration between the Computer Science, Business Management, and Product Design programs was formed to work on actual projects with real clients. This interdisciplinary form of collaboration simulates the realities of a diverse Software Engineering team. Background: A collaborative approach implemented through projects has been the established pedagogy for introducing the Software Engineering course to undergraduate Computer Science students. The collaboration, however, is limited to collaboration among Computer Science students and their clients. This case study explored an enhancement to the collaborative approach to project development by integrating other related disciplines into the project development framework; hence, the Interdisciplinary Approach. Methodology: This study adopted the case method approach. An interdisciplinary service innovation activity was proposed to invite other disciplines in the learning process of the computer science students. The agile methodology Scrum was used as the software development approach during project development. Survey data were collected from the students to establish (a) their perception of the interdisciplinary approach to project development; (b) the factors that influenced success or failure of their team to deliver the project; and (c) the perceived skills or knowledge that they acquired from the interdisciplinary approach. Analysis of data followed a mixed method approach. Contribution: The study improved the current pedagogy for Software Engineering education by integrating other related disciplines into the software project development framework. Findings: Data collected showed that the students generally accepted the interdisciplinary approach to project development. Factors such as project relevance, teamwork, time and schedule, and administration support, among others, affect team performance towards project completion. In the case of the Computer Science students, results show that students have learned skills during the experience that, as literature reveal, can only be acquired or mastered in their future profession as software engineers. Recommendations for Practitioners: The active collaboration of the industry with the University and the involvement of the other related courses in teaching software engineering methods are critical to the development of the students, not only in learning the methodology but also as a working professional. Recommendation for Researchers: It is interesting to know and eventually understand the interactions between interdisciplinary team members in the conduct of Software Engineering practices while working on their projects. More specifically, what creative tensions arise and how do the interdisciplinary teams handle the discourse? Impact on Society: This study bridges the gap between how Software Engineering is taught in the university and how Software Engineering teams work in real life. Future Research: Future research is targeted at refining and elaborating the elements of the interdisciplinary framework presented in this paper towards an integrated course module for Software Engineering education.

AB  - Post-truth is a social condition that threatens the trust in science and people's critical thinking. This paper analyzes some of the educational responses to post-truth, claiming the potential contributions of Science and Technology Studies (STS). Some of the responses based on traditional epistemology, characterized as "epistemological vaccines," are contrasted with some of the possible responses based on a more complex and interdisciplinary knowledge of science and technology. It is argued that epistemological vaccines, despite having an enormous value in fighting against post-truth, are insufficient to transform this social condition and its implications for science and technology. It is sustained that a social epistemology and, moreover, an expert interdisciplinary approach to the knowledge of science and technology, such as the one offered by STS, is required to consolidate stronger educational strategies, formulating "STS vaccines," that could be useful as a counterweight to understand and deconstruct post-truth. Given that the STS academic field has developed a good account of how scientific facts and social trust in science are constructed, it also has the capacity to show how post-truth and alternative facts are constructed, unmasking for whom it is important that we decry science. The conclusion points toward the urgency to rethink the current influence of the STS field in the educational context to relocate the STS education.

AB  - Challenges to the Arctic region abound and intersect. Warming, ice and permafrost melting, and pollution jeopardize health and food security of Indigenous and other Northern communities. Problems related to natural resource extraction and shipping are developing. Because these issues cross sovereign boundaries, they must be addressed multilaterally. The Arctic Council is the principal forum in which Arctic states and Indigenous groups address shared concerns in the region. We co-administered a five-day program on science and diplomacy in the Arctic at Dartmouth College in June 2017 to educate postsecondary students on Arctic challenges and governance, foster skills and confidence related to leadership and diplomacy, and inspire civic action in Arctic and international affairs. The program consisted of lectures, discussions, a teamwork and collaboration exercise, a negotiation workshop, and a Model Arctic Council (MAC)--a simulation of delegates' work in the Arctic Council. We found that students had strongly positive perceptions of the curriculum and felt that they accrued Arctic-related awareness and skills, while developing enthusiasm for engaging in civic affairs. Students attributed the program's value to the use of multiple pedagogies, especially simulation, an interdisciplinary environment, and mentorship from and engagement with Arctic Council and other practitioners.

AB  - Recent reforms in science education shift the focus of instruction to supporting students' sensemaking about phenomena. At the same time, discussions of equity in science education have become more common and more contested. For emergent bilingual (EB) learners, there is growing consensus that these trends together imply valuing diverse linguistic and cultural resources that students draw upon to make sense of the world. However, asset-based pedagogies often do not attend to the role of oppression and the co-construction of linguistic and racial marginalization. Furthermore, culturally responsive pedagogies push beyond valuing student assets to challenge the end goals of education, emphasizing the development of critical consciousness. Through this case study of one thematic unit within a transitional bilingual physical science class, this study puts forth "pedagogías entrenzadas" as a purposeful braiding of asset and critical pedagogies that attend to science, language, and cultural responsiveness. The study took place in a Title I school in the suburbs of a large midwestern city where the majority of students are from Latin American immigrant families. "Pedagogías entrenzadas" are articulated through the analysis of classroom episodes that attended to language, science, and cultural responsiveness in combination. By attending to these three facets in braided ways, the teacher created ruptures in systems that structurally exclude EB students. We present three classroom episodes in conjunction with additional evidence from a larger data set to demonstrate the ways "pedagogías entrenzadas" created spaces where (1) generative themes and words created opportunities for holistic sensemaking; (2) there were opportunities to consider and critique language and science; and (3) heterogeneity in linguistic, cultural, and academic resources was upheld and valued. The implications of this pedagogical work extended outside of the classroom, where the teacher successfully advocated with colleagues for the creation of an asset-based bilingual science program.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to explore how elementary preservice teachers' mathematics-science integrated teaching strategies changed as a result of participating in exemplary interdisciplinary activities with multiple themes across school curricula. The participating elementary preservice teachers (n = 28) were recruited for this study from the College of Education students enrolled at a medium-sized southwestern research university in the United States. A qualitative methodology with pre-and-post data collection from open-ended surveys was used in the current study to explore the development of preservice teachers' mathematics teaching strategies with connections to science themed activities before and after an 8-week intervention. In general, the results from the pre-and-post surveys revealed that the preservice teachers' interdisciplinary knowledge of using science-themed activities as instructional approaches for teaching mathematics had remarkable changes across all four science content areas including physics, chemistry, biology, and environmental and space science. This study provided additional empirical evidence on how contextualized mathematics educational activities, in the current case using the association between science and mathematics, can be used as effective teacher education resources for developing teachers' capacity for designing mathematics lessons.

AB  - This article explores Vanessa Anthony-Stevens and Sammy Matsaw's paper "The Productive Uncertainty of Indigenous and Decolonizing Methodologies in the Preparation of Interdisciplinary STEM Researchers". That paper reports on a small qualitative study on how STEM students in the field of natural resources management react to the inclusion of Indigenous ways of knowing in their interdisciplinary research methodologies course. The authors are engaging contested intersections of knowledge that are notoriously difficult to negotiate. I argue that the inclusion of Indigenous 'ways of knowing' into the water resource management curriculum is based on Morgan's (in: McKinley, Smith (eds) Handbook of indigenous education, Springer, Singapore, pp 111-128, 2019. 10.1007/978-981-10-3899-0) idea of the 'guest paradigm'. At the same time, and in contrast, I also argue that the inclusion of Indigenous knowledge in the curriculum cannot just occur in the classroom but needs to be considered at an institutional and individual level as well. The project should be seen as a small step within a wider Indigenous agenda of decolonizing the Eurocentric curriculum.

AB  - While a renewed national dialog promotes the importance of science education for future technological and economic viability, students must find science personally relevant to themselves and their communities if the goals set forth in recent reform movements are to be achieved. In this paper, we investigate how incorporating an ecological perspective to learning in teacher education, including opportunities to participate with science in connection to their everyday lives, influenced the ways in which elementary teacher candidates (TCs) envisioned learning and doing science and its potential role in their future classroom. We draw from data collected across three sections of a field-based elementary methods course focused on learning to teach science and social studies through inquiry. We argue that participating in an authentic interdisciplinary inquiry project impacted the ways in which TCs conceived of science, their identities as science learners and teachers and their commitments to bringing inquiry-based science instruction to their future classrooms. This paper addresses issues regarding access to quality science learning experiences in elementary classrooms through empowering TCs to build identities as science learners and teachers in order to impact conditions in their future classrooms.

AB  - There is a long tradition of teaching science through inquiry, with broad agreement about the form it should take. Students should investigate researchable questions; gather and analyse data; and develop and represent evidence-based claims. Authoritative teacher or textbook representations are generally used to guide this learning (Buckley & Boulter, 2000; Bybee, 1997; Furtak et al., 2012; Sell et al., 2006). Parallel to this approach, teachers have also guided students to construct, review and refine their own representations, leading to learning gains. However, this student representation construction approach poses new challenges for teachers. The teacher is expected to elicit and guide students' reasoning about their own represented claims as an orientation to understanding and learning scientific forms of reasoning and their representation. In this paper, drawing on our initial account of this pedagogy, we aim to clarify further this approach's rationale and teacher strategies and underlying purposes in key early stages of exploration in the topics of chemistry and mathematics with a Grade 5 class. An interdisciplinary focus was used to guide students' learning about the science concepts of states of matter, evaporation and the mathematical concepts of formal and informal measurement and data representation. Analysed data included video capture of the teacher's guidance of tasks and classroom discussion, student artefacts and teacher and student interviews. We identify how the teacher framed the task, oriented student inquiry and guided evaluation of students' representations through implicit and explicit instruction.

AB  - This research aims to determine science student teachers' views and conceptions of the interdisciplinary sexual health education course. Also, the current study inferiorly purposes to eliminate their misconceptions after the course. Data were obtained from in-class student products, course evaluation forms and course field notes. Within a qualitative methodology, they were descriptively evaluated and analyzed. The science student teachers under investigation stated that the interdisciplinary sexual health education course was very effective at freely talking about sexuality. Further, they depicted that they were able to easily get more accurate, reliable and memorable information from primary sources by asking the specialists/experts during the course. Overall, it can be concluded that the course remedied their misconceptions of the sexuality.

AB  - The aim of this article is to prove the advisability of using the interdisciplinary approach for the formation of learners' situational interest in physics. The general method of using the interdisciplinary approach in physics teaching has been created. The study of new material, the formation of abilities and skills, and the work on projects are the forms of the interdisciplinary links in physics teaching. The scheme for interest formation towards physics in the context of development of situational and individual interest has been analyzed. According to the interdisciplinary approach, the tools for the formation of learners' situational interest in physics have been allocated. These are phenomena of nature, phenomena of everyday life, link between theory and practice. The results showed that interdisciplinary approach in physics teaching increases the level of learners' situational interest. Proposed general method of using the interdisciplinary approach can be used for teaching other sciences.

AB  - Science writing is a complex rhetorical activity that enhances disciplinary participation in university education and requires learner-centered, inquiry-based explicit instruction. This study aimed to determine the effects of teaching writing self-assessment of scientific posters on writing quality and academic achievement in a higher education science class. An interdisciplinary team of science and writing scholars designed an action-research intervention based on two 90-min workshops focused on students' self-assessment of writing scientific posters for a first-semester Cell Biology course for prospective teachers of biology and chemistry in secondary schools. Students co-created and applied a checklist to assess writing traits central to scientific communication (e.g. use of reliable references and original figures, inclusion of limitations and projections) in their posters. Promoted writing traits were qualitatively coded in double-blind fashion in posters from 19 teams with similar intakes: 9 teams (45 students, 100% population) in the treatment group and 10 teams (50 randomly selected students, 50% population) from two previous years. Principal component analysis (PCA) and permutation ANOVA were used to quantitatively determine divergence between groups. Results indicated that posters constructed by intervention-treated teams were significantly better in terms of the reliability and retrievability of sources; they also showed a higher number of student-made figures, projections and conclusions. In addition, evaluators' scores for posters increased in the treatment groups, although this did not have a significant impact on overall grades. These results offer empirical support of self-assessment for learning and the use of poster construction as effective pedagogical strategies in science teacher education.

AB  - Inspiring children to pursue a career in science is a worthy pursuit for many reasons. One way to achieve this is to actively engage children in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning from an early age. However, it is not always possible to integrate all the STEM fields in one activity. Rather, careful consideration of the discrete disciplines of science, technology, engineering and mathematics and their appropriateness for the given activity may be preferable to full, transdisciplinary integration. This report describes a research project designed to support primary school children in their appreciation of scientific research through use of the 5E Instructional Model -- Engagement, Exploration, Explanation, Elaboration, and Evaluation --while applying the complementary elements of a mathematics-based statistical investigation to pose questions, collect data, represent, analyse, and interpret the data, as well as reach informed conclusions

AB  - Futures studies is usually a transdisciplinary study and as such embraces the physical world of the sciences and system sciences and the subjective world of individuals and cultures, as well as the time dimension--past, present and futures. Science education, where student interests, opportunities and challenges often manifest themselves, can provide a suitable entry point for futures work. In this paper, we describe how we have used futures themes, concepts and techniques both implicitly and explicitly in our undergraduate middle school teacher education courses and, in particular, science curriculum and general studies courses. Taking a critical orientation to the past and the present in these courses enables the future to be more than a mere reproduction of the status quo and opens up a range of possible futures in the areas of current interest. For example, having studied middle school teaching and learning in mathematics and science, students explore the past, present and possible future of a natural part of a university campus. In a general studies course on the science of the Earth's atmosphere, students construct a normative futures scenario on living in a changing climate. One way to gain insight into an uncertain future is to construct scenarios. This technique has been used since the 1970s to bring issues of environment and development--areas with strong science content--to the attention of both scientists and policymakers.

AB  - Research studies using discourse analysis approaches make claims about phenomena or issues based on interpretation of written or spoken text, which includes images and gestures. How are findings/interpretations from discourse analysis validated? This paper proposes transdisciplinary convergence as a way to validate discourse analysis approaches to research. The argument is made that discourse analysis explicitly grounded in semiotics, systemic functional linguistics, and critical theory, offers a credible research methodology. The underlying assumptions, constructs, and techniques of analysis of these three theoretical disciplines can be drawn on to show convergence of data at multiple levels, validating interpretations from text analysis.

AB  - STEAM education evolved to address the critical demand for creative transdisciplinary teaching that was under-realized in STEM programs. However, this novel concept has not been clearly conceptualized; this is likely attributed to the lack of a grounding theory to frame STEAM. We propose using connected learning theory to examine a previously developed STEAM conceptual model. This work explores the potential of connected learning theory to understand specific STEAM instructional practices. Using observations of 43 middle-grade teachers from 14 schools enacting STEAM practices in their classrooms, we examined what connected learning looked like in STEAM classrooms and how the STEAM conceptual model could be enhanced by analyzing implementation practices through the principles of connected learning. The qualitative data analysis of observations, video recorded data, and debriefing sessions with teachers after the observations included two rounds of analysis. This found significant overlap in ideas of connected learning and STEAM, notably a shared emphasis on design, collaboration, and contextualized learning.

AB  - This paper describes a pilot study that explores students learning how to program via a multi-disciplinary approach. The study participants were eleven 6th grade students who learned programming fundamentals via music activities in a Scratch 3.0 environment. These activities included the programming of familiar melodies and the development of suitable animations or computer games. For that matter, a study unit termed MelodyCode was developed in the spirit of the STEAM education approach and the spiral learning method and included exploration tasks based on individual learning. Via the programming of familiar melodies, they became acquainted with programming concepts such as functions, variables, repetition and control commands, parallel processes, and more. Competitions that win awards were held from time to time, which prompted students to invest efforts in their projects to reach first place and gain the teacher and classmates' appreciation. The study was conducted in the form of action research. The data analysis yielded references to the effect of MelodyCode on common stereotypes students hold regarding programming (masculine profession, necessitates good mathematics knowledge), cognitive aspects (cognitive load, linking music concrete use to abstract programming concepts), and affective aspects (joyful and relaxing class atmosphere, motivation, curiosity, self-efficacy).

AB  - College science education needs to foster students' habit of mind beyond disciplinary constraints. However, little research has been devoted to assessing students' interdisciplinary understanding. To address this problem, we formed a team of experts from different disciplines to develop interdisciplinary assessments that target introductory college-level science. We started our project by focusing on osmosis, a topic that involves knowledge from multiple science disciplines. We developed an instrument focusing on this topic and administered it to 3 classes of college students. A Rasch partial credit analysis showed that the items demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties. The findings also revealed the differences between student's disciplinary and interdisciplinary understanding. The educational implications of the study were discussed.

AB  - Implemented was a 45-minute per day Primary Science IDEAS intervention in grades 1-2 integrating reading and writing within science instruction in a multi-year study conducted in 8 experimental and 9 control schools. Results found a significant direct achievement effect in grades 1-2 on both the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) Science and Reading. In addition, the direct effect of the intervention in grades 1-2 also resulted in significant achievement transfer from grades 1-2 to grade 3 on both the ITBS Science and Reading. Discussed are policy implications of the findings for increasing instructional time allocated to science in grades 1-2 and expanding the focus of grade 1-2 student achievement assessment to include content-area learning.

AB  - The public's growing interest in epigenetics, particularly its applications in human health, underscores the significance of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating gene activity and promoting phenotypic diversity without altering DNA sequences. Within the framework of the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis, epigenetics is regarded as a non-genetic contributor to evolution. The EPIBOOST project, "BOOSting excellence in environmental EPIgenetics," investigates epigenetic changes induced by contaminants in aquatic organisms and aims to enhance public understanding of epigenetics through science outreach videos. A multidisciplinary team comprising Biology, Education, and Design researchers produced the video "What is Epigenetics?" using a design-based research methodology and a design thinking approach. This process involved storyboard design, audio recording, image production, video editing, testing, refinement, and public dissemination. The interactive development of the storyboard and script aimed to efficiently communicate the significance of epigenetics, fostering public understanding of this emerging research area through an effective science communication strategy. This paper focuses on the development process for the first video, which aims to promote public awareness of epigenetics using the AEIOU framework (Awareness, Enjoyment, Interest, Opinions, and Understanding) to elucidate epigenetic concepts such as DNA methylation, gene expression, and phenotype, and their integration in environmental assessment frameworks.

AB  - Information technology is a significant action to promote education informatization. Currently, there are numerous literature studies on information technology education, but existing research lacks a comparative summary of the research status, research hot spots, and research trend of information technology in China and abroad from an overall perspective. Therefore, this paper selected the information technology education literature collected by China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Web of Science Core Collection (WoS) from 2000 to 2021 as the research object and used bibliometrics to analyze the literature characteristics, core forces, research hot spot, and frontier trend of information technology education in China and abroad. The results showed that: (1) The discipline literature of information technology education showed a fluctuating growth trend, in which the growth rate of foreign literature was faster, and the scale of Chinese literature was slightly smaller; Both Chinese and foreign literature involved pedagogy, computer, and other disciplines, with the characteristics of multi-disciplinary integration. (2) The United States was the leading country in this field, followed by China, with the total literature accounting for more than 50%, ranking the leading position in the world; China Audio-Visual Education and Computers & Education were representative journals in China and abroad. (3) Foreign research focused on information technology, education, science, attitude, model, perception, experience, self-efficacy, Internet, etc. China's hotspots included information literacy, computational thinking, curriculum standards, application contexts, teaching models, subject integration, etc. Foreign research focused on both theory and practice, while China focused on the theoretical nature of the subject, but the degree of practice was insufficient. (4) Student participation, technology integration, teaching innovation, Internet +, core literacy, and artificial intelligence (AI) have been popular until now, constituting the discipline frontier in information technology education.

AB  - Statistics is interdisciplinary and the practical application of statistical methods in various areas prompts undergraduates to learn more about statistics and better understand complex methods. This article presents a classroom teaching design that guides students in reading COVID-19 literature. The activities presented encourage peer-peer and student-instructor interaction, which can be modified based on the type of course offered as well as the level and major of students by changing the articles required for reading. The teaching activities are designed with evidence-based teaching strategies such as scaffolding and connecting the activities to learning outcomes aligned with levels of Bloom's Taxonomy. In our experience, the COVID-19 literature teaching activity improves students' learning interest, cultivates students' critical thinking, and enhances students' understanding of theoretical methods. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

AB  - In this study, the implementation of a STEAM project was critically examined, with constructivist grounded principles utilized to inform the perspective of both a learner and a STEAM practitioner. A comprehensive project plan was devised that incorporated CAP domains through the integration of the STEAM praxis with peer and self-assessment strategies for school-level science education. This innovative approach, aimed at nurturing the aesthetic value in arts and the evaluation process, led to the creation of a unique methodology for assessing students' cognitive and psychomotor skills. The framework for accessing students' peer/self-evaluation via meticulously designed rubrics is further highlighted. The implementation of a project plan proved to be an interactive and insightful process, fostering a profound understanding of students' concerns and interests. This study underscores the transformative potential of the STEAM approach in educational settings, highlighting its role in promoting critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills among students.

AB  - Recognition of the value of a scientifically literate citizenry has driven American science education reform since the 1950s. We have seen some improvement in the comprehension of science facts in the past 10-20 years, but far less improvement in Americans' understanding of the nature of science. College science courses are ideal venues for promoting science literacy. However, in an effort to condense a complicated subject into a single semester, the nature of science is often lost amidst the facts presented in a freshman survey course, often the entirety  of a non-science major's experience in science. We argue that an interdisciplinary approach that integrates the sciences and the humanities can attract non-science majors, increasing these students' exposure to scientific concepts by relating them to students' existing interests and knowledge. This fosters science literacy by teaching students that science is a process of human inquiry with a distinct methodology, instead of simply a litany of facts. We recommend that a successful interdisciplinary course should present an engaging topic with which students can  identify, incorporate opportunities for student research, and offer site visits to working laboratories.

AB  - The need to map the evolution of trends in any field of activity arises when a large amount of data is available on that activity, thus making impossible a manual exploration of the data in order to understand how the field or the activity is evolving. Topic and trend mapping is a mature field with hundreds of publications on approaches, methods and tools for data collection, analysis, feature extraction and reduction, clustering and visualisation tools and algorithms. Our study aims to map the evolution of topics published by the journal "Education for Information. Interdisciplinary Journal on Information Studies" (EFI henceforth) which has been in existence since 1983, in order to understand how this journal has evolved and how it is positioned with regard to the field of Library and Information Science to which it belongs. Our study is part of the body of work on topic detection and text mining. Our results showed that the journal displayed a remarkable stability in its editorial policy over more than three decades. With the arrival of its third Editor in Chief in 2018, a shift towards more technologically oriented topics and to specialties from other fields are perceptible such as health information, data science and digital humanities.

AB  - The development of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Liberal Arts, and Mathematics) curricula has emerged in the past decade. A pedagogical STEAM (Scaffolding, Tutoring, Engaging, Argumentation, and Modeling) model was proposed in this study to implement interdisciplinary STEAM curricula. The effects of this model on students' project competence and learning motivation were evaluated. A quasi-experimental design was adopted in the study. One hundred fourteen participants were recruited from a high school in southern Taiwan. There were 57 students in the experimental group (27 males; 30 females) and 57 in the comparison group (35 males; 22 females). The results revealed that the implementation of the pedagogical STEAM model was able to enhance the project competence and learning motivation of the students in the experimental group. Qualitative data from student interviews also revealed that the students had positive perceptions of the model. The main implication of this study is that the pedagogical STEAM model has the potential to be used as a teaching guide for the high school interdisciplinary curricula.

AB  - Science teacher educators (STEs) have key roles in the educational system through their preparation of pre- and in-service science teachers and in implementing future-oriented policy reforms. Given the complexity and importance of their role, what types of knowledge do STEs need? STEs come from a range of backgrounds and there are few systematic routes for their ongoing learning. Hence, there is a need for tools that can help define and assess STEs' competence. The purpose of this theoretical paper is to highlight central knowledge domains for STEs. We draw on previous work and add perspectives from current trends in science education and teacher education to describe four knowledge domains for STEs: natural science, science education in school, science teacher education and science education research. The main contribution of the paper is an updated conceptualisation of the nature of STEs' knowledge and qualifications, taking into account current requirements for future-oriented science education and teacher education including deeper learning and critical thinking skills, cross-curricular work, education for sustainable development, and research-based teacher education. The four knowledge domains can serve as a tool for identifying needs, recruiting staff with desired expertise, and tailoring interventions to support professional development for STEs from various backgrounds.

AB  - The implementation of theatre as a didactic tool for teaching science provides a new perspective on the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in the construction of meaningful learning experiences. Gamification and collaborative work are functional strategies to teach scientific concepts in a creative way. However, there are still conceptual issues about spatial thinking that are difficult for students to understand owing to the lack of visualization of objects and their development through a characteristic chronicle. Here we show an innovative way to unifying science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) careers through the development of an interactive theatrical play inspired by "The Little Prince" novella, to promote a culture of integration of science, theatre and literature. One of the more significant findings to emerge from this study is that the didactic strategies used are key ingredients in order to design an unique theatre play based on a link between history of atomic models and literature towards full understanding of spatial macroscales and microscales thinking. Due to the successful in the qualitative assessment results, we are devising to continue exploring the use of these didactic strategies to achieve an integrated and greater impact on students' learning processes.

AB  - Experience working in multidisciplinary teams is important both to prepare Computer Science (CS) students for industry and to improve their communication with teammates from disciplines other than their own. This article describes the evolution and results of collaborations among three courses: an undergraduate CS course about user interface design and implementation, an undergraduate Scientific and Technical Communication (STC) course about usability and instructions writing, and a graduate CS/Human Factors course about user-interface evaluation and usability testing. Students from all three courses work with scientists to complete the scientist-sponsored citizen science Android applications (apps). Students from the undergraduate CS and STC courses form multidisciplinary teams to design and implement apps, while the graduate students consult with the teams by evaluating and user-testing the apps. The collaboration's effectiveness was assessed using student surveys, interviews, and evaluations of student work. This article compares the collaboration within the teams and the coordination with the scientists across two years of activities in order to determine the effectiveness of course modifications. The article concludes with recommendations for improving the collaboration within teams and the coordination with clients in multidisciplinary course projects.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce Notice, Wonder, Feel, Act, and Reimagine (NWFAR) to promote social justice in data science (DS) education. NWFAR draws on intersectional feminist DS to scaffold critical perspectives towards systems of power and oppression and attend to students' experiences in designs for learning. NWFAR adds three practices that are typically not emphasized in learning designs for DS: feel--engaging emotions and the physical body; act--challenging, inspiring, or informing others towards change; and reimagine--envisioning how data, data methods, and data technologies could pursue different problems, solutions, and perspectives. We illustrate NWFAR through two design-based research projects from prior empirical work. Through these two examples, we demonstrate what thinking with NWFAR could look like in practice and highlight future possibilities for learning. We conclude with a discussion that focuses on the reimagining dimension, in which we highlight social-justice oriented theories

AB  - The integration of mathematics and science teaching and learning facilitates student learning, engagement, motivation, problem-solving, criticality and real-life application. However, the actual implementation of an integrative approach to the teaching and learning of both subjects at classroom level, with in-service teachers working collaboratively, at second-level education, is under-researched due to the complexities of school-based research. This study reports on a year-long case study on the implementation of an integrated unit of learning on distance, speed and time, within three second-level schools in Ireland. This study employed a qualitative approach and examined the key aspects of practice that impact on the integration of mathematics and science teaching and learning. We argue that teacher perspective, teacher knowledge of the "other subject" and of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), and teacher collaboration and support all impact on the implementation of an integrative approach to mathematics and science education.

AB  - This case study aims to verify the benefits of theme-based project learning for convergent science experiments. The study explores the possibilities of enhancing creative, integrated and collaborative teaching and learning abilities in science-gifted education. A convergent project-based science experiment program of physics, chemistry and biology with the theme of environment such as seawater and wetland was designed and applied to science-gifted secondary school students in an international science contest. The program was initiated with integration of physics, chemistry and biology, interrelating both field work and laboratory work. Besides, logical discussion and humanistic writing activities with environmental issues were followed. The participants were tasked to conduct hands-on multi-disciplinary projects for both in the fields and laboratories. The projects involve raising creative and critical thinking through interpreting collected data, predicting outcomes, drawing conclusions, and presenting results. The study shows a model of project-based convergent programs for integrated experimental composition to facilitate collaborative and creative learning as well as to improve students' interests in related subjects. The study discusses ways to raise awareness of benefits from multi-disciplinary approaches through theme-based project learning in science-gifted education.

AB  - Limited studies investigate the high school teachers' challenges and strategies while teaching science and mathematics in English as the target language through the content and language integrated learning (CLIL) approach. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the challenges that science and math teachers encounter and the strategies they employ while fostering students' development of proficiency in English as the target language in physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics courses in the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) and International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP). The study utilized various qualitative tools such as semi-structured interviews, open-ended questionnaires, and lesson observations to analyze science and math teachers' strategies and challenges at a case school in eastern Turkey. The study revealed that as part of the CLIL approach, the participant teachers indicated various challenges such as a lack of vocabulary repertoire, translation problems, and weak foundational knowledge. They used common strategies such as group work interactions, interdisciplinary activities, individualized feedback, the promotion of higher-order thinking skills, inquiry-based learning, and reinforcement of language used to deal with these challenges. The study presents further implications for good practices and recommendations to resolve challenges.

AB  - The paper is situated within the theoretical and methodological framework of the the Joint Action Theory of Didactics (Sensevy, Le Sens du Savoir. Eléments pour une Théorie de l'Action Conjointe en Didactique, De Boeck, 2011; Santini et al., Science & Education 27:921-961, 2018) and within the practice turn line of research on epistemic practices in science education. We investigate classroom practice seeking to achieve the concurrent learning of English as a foreign language together with disciplinary knowledge of physics as a practice. Classroom life is analyzed closely in order to identify traces of effective learning through epistemic practices (Santini et al., Science & Education 27:921-961, 2018; Kelly, Linder et al.Östman et al.Roberts et al.Wickman et al.Erikson et al.McKinnon (eds), Exploring the landscape of scientific literacy, Routledge, 2011) in both foreign language proficiency and discipline learning (Cunningham and Kelly, Science Education 101:486-505, 2017; Cunningham et al., Science Education 105:255-280, 2020). Founded on a Wittgensteinian concept of language, the notions of thought style and jargon are posited as useful notions to identify the epistemic value of classroom activity. This is in relation to the epistemic potential inherent in the situations presented in class, as well as the culturally constructed body of knowledge pertaining to the epistemic potential at stake. The modeling of classroom activity in this research rendered visible aspects of classroom practice which were essential to understanding the progression of knowledge objectives in situ, as well as the epistemic value of an actor's move in relation to the epistemic potential of a given context. The study concludes by positing the notions as efficient tools for both the analysis and design of learning environments, in particular for environments where language can be seen to be organically linked to the practice in which it is embedded (Collins, Social Studies of Science 41:271-300, 2011; Sensevy, G. Gruson, B., & Le Hénaff, C. (2019). Sur la notion de jargon. Quelques réflexions sur le langage et les langues. In C. Chaplier & A. -M. O'Connel (Éd.), Épistémologie à usage didactique.

AB  - In this article, we first (re)trace the presence and absence of mining, metals and extractionary practices, what we call MMEs, from environmental and sustainability curricular frameworks United Nations' Act Now Framework. Then, we critique the swelling markets, mentalities, and mastermindings used to develop and produce "clean" and "renewable" energy sources/solutions. As one of many examples, there is increasing skepticism among Indigenous communities that history may repeat itself as the quest for "clean" results in further displacement and violations of tribal sovereignty (Healy & Baker, 2021; Holzman & Waldman, 2022; Shah & Bloomer, 2018). Notwithstanding our (e.g., authors) academic positionalities in social studies education, one of our conclusions considers the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration between science and social studies on the issue of sustainability through MMEs.

AB  - Learning standards for K-12 science education emphasize the importance of engaging students in practices that scientists perform in their profession. K-12 teachers are expected to engage students in scientific modeling, which entails constructing, testing, evaluating, and revising their own models of science phenomena while pursuing an epistemic goal. However, conceptualizing models of unobservable science phenomena without support is daunting for students. We propose that creating science simulations with block-based coding in Scratch is a promising approach to support student's scientific modeling and learning to code. However, research indicates that preservice and in-service science teachers often hold a deficient understanding of scientific modeling instruction, and lack experience teaching with coding. Professional learning on use of block-based coding in scientific modeling instruction is needed though such interdisciplinary research is scarce. In this paper, we review pertinent literature and propose five guidelines for teacher educators striving to offer such professional learning. The guidelines informed the design and development of coding in scientific modeling lessons (CS-ModeL), which is a module and an online tool for scaffolding teachers' learning to code science simulations, and to integrate simulation coding activities into scientific modeling lessons, respectively. We discuss how guidelines informed the design and development of CS-ModeL, as well as plans for future research.

AB  - Learning at Scale is a fast growing field that affects formal, informal, and workplace education. Highly interdisciplinary, it builds on solid foundations in the learning sciences, computer science, education, and the social sciences. We define learning at scale as the study of the technologies, pedagogies, analyses, and theories of learning and teaching that take place with a large number of learners and a high ratio of learners to facilitators. The scale of these environments often changes the very nature of the interaction and learning experiences. We identify three types of technologies that support scale in education: dedicated content-agnostic platforms, such as MOOCs; dedicated tools, such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems; and repurposed platforms, such as social networks. We further identify five areas that scale affects: learners, research and data, adaptation, space and time, and pedagogy. Introducing the papers in this special issue on the topic, we discuss the characteristics, affordances, and promise of learning at scale.

AB  - One of the aims of Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) in Scotland is greater inclusion of interdisciplinary learning and teaching in school education. There is, arguably, a limited amount of guidance in the CfE literature to advise and support secondary teachers in the practical implications of the planning, preparation and implementation of interdisciplinary learning and teaching. This paper examines this guidance and insights from research literature and presents the findings from a research project, "Searching for Meaning," which focused on science and religious education teachers collaborating in planned interdisciplinary learning and teaching in secondary schools. The paper identifies some of the key factors for effective interdisciplinary learning and teaching between science and religious education. These include: support from the school leadership; openness to interdisciplinary work and willingness to learn about other disciplines; teamwork, dialogue and joint planning and the need for time and support for teachers. These findings are potentially significant for other forms of interdisciplinary learning and teaching.

AB  - In an effort to promote integrated STEM education, the Malaysian government has integrated STEM teaching framework within the science and mathematics curriculum specifications to guide the science and mathematics teachers to design and implement interdisciplinary teaching while teaching science and/or mathematics concepts. Some of the factors that make STEM teaching effective include knowledge about integrating the different subjects in teaching and teachers' pedagogical strategies, perceived difficulties (PD), and self-efficacy. This study was designed to measure and model the relationships between these three factors and integrated STEM teaching practices in a sample of Malaysian teachers. Data obtained from 573 science and mathematics teachers were analyzed using a partial least square structural equation modeling approach. Findings revealed that the model derived from a combination of the three factors exhibits substantial predictive power and thus has substantial relevance for STEM teaching. Knowledge and perceived efficacy have significant positive effects on and PD have significant negative direct relationships with STEM teaching. Knowledge has a significant negative and positive mediation effect between difficulties and integrated STEM practices, and self-efficacy and integrated STEM practices, respectively. This study has immediate implications for developing teacher professional development curriculum and STEM education policymakers in Malaysia, and it is a model to be tested in other countries or regions intending STEM education reforms.

AB  - In this commentary, I build on recent interdisciplinary models for embodied cognition with additional perspectives from affective neuroscience, educational psychology, creativity theory, and science education. I invoke William James and John Dewey, pioneers of an embodied philosophy of mind, alongside recent affective neuroscience theory about the role of bodily emotional response in learning. I present educational implications of the need for meaning making through body-mind and affective interaction with a social learning environment. I reformulate the problem of learner engagement in school to look beyond the need for autonomy, belonging, and competency to include the need for creative meaning making in learner engagement. To provide context, I explore the experience of adolescent students using a drama-based pedagogical tool to learn an abstract science concept. This example illustrates how embodied, creative learning rich with metaphor shapes meaning making in science learning. I conclude by elaborating further on a proposed model of creative engagement.

AB  - Since 2005 we have pursued a formal research program called the BRAID (Bringing Relationships Alive through Interdisciplinary Discourse), which is designed to develop and test strategies for training first- and second-year undergraduate science students to bridge scientific disciplines. The BRAID's ongoing multiyear investigation points to preliminary conclusions about what does and does not promote student interdisciplinary thinking. Perhaps not surprisingly, our research suggested the most effective technique for helping introductory students see science in integrated terms has been the most direct: explicitly discussing and engaging in debate about the connections found in the real world in a seminar setting. On the other hand, adding a thin gilding of interdisciplinarity to existing courses accomplishes little. Our goal is not to devise the "ideal" interdisciplinary educational experience, but one that is efficient and sustainable in a wide range of existing curricular structures. We are particularly sensitive to the need to avoid creating eclectic models dependent on our particular institutional setting. (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.)

AB  - Robots are useful tools for teaching mathematics and physics and engineering subjects in K-12 setting; they can be utilized in classrooms for explaining difficult and complex concepts because they capture the imagination of students. Rapid developments robotics technology in recent decade, institutions and researchers have employed robots to support K-12 education. Furthermore, Educators are increasingly interested in the potential of robots in education for learners. Due to its multidisciplinary nature, robots are considered a gateway to STEM education. Researchers in educational field are looking answers of Can robots in classroom reshape K-12 STEM education, and foster new ways of learning? In the present study, IT and Technology & Design Teachers' views on utilizing robots in instruction was investigated. Furthermore, teachers' willingness to use robots in diverse learning settings. The findings of the research revealed that most of the teachers were not employed robots in their teaching. However, overwhelm majority participants expressed their willingness of using robots in their education specifically in STEM education. Teachers reported that robots can be utilized as an instructional support tool in the classroom. [For the complete proceedings, see ED631021.]

AB  - Games are a proven tool for learning at all ages and in many contexts. They increase the attractiveness of learning processes through arousing interest and enhancing motivation, and aid with the development of social skills. Educational games provide teachers with different approaches to teaching. 'The Game of the Sea' is an interdisciplinary board game, specifically designed to teach its players about the marine environment, regardless of their age. Through its 68 sections, coloured according to particular topics and organised as a fish shape, players encounter a wide range of questions and activities. Through playing this game, players acquire a broad knowledge of science, the marine environment and its importance, and literature. The game uses an interdisciplinary approach with question cards on a variety of topics (including maths, physics, biology, chemistry, art, etc.). A total of 222 players (111 children, aged 11-15, and 111 adults, aged 18-72) tested the game. These players were enrolled in different formal and non-formal educational contexts and had different educational backgrounds. For a qualitative analysis of game sessions (participant observation), researchers acted as game moderators and, while doing so, made subtle observations of players playing the game. On top of this, the value of the game, as a didactic tool, was evaluated with a test that players took before and after the game. After playing the game, knowledge of the marine environment, increased in both children and adults, with a slightly higher increase in children. Therefore, 'The Game of the Sea' is suitable for teaching all ages about the marine environment. Further, this game can impart to its players the importance of the marine environment and the importance of protecting this environment.
