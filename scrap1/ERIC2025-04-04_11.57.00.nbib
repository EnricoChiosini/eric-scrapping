AB  - STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education is an interdisciplinary approach aimed at enhancing students' understanding of these disciplines and fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This study investigates the experiences and perceptions of 20 third-year pre-service science teachers (PSSTs) participating in STEM practices at a Turkish public university. The research addresses three key questions: (1) What are the opinions of STEM teacher candidates? (2) What benefits and challenges did they encounter during STEM practices? (3) How do they perceive STEM education and its implications for students and teachers? A qualitative case study methodology was employed to gather in-depth insights from PSSTs. The sample was selected using criterion sampling to ensure relevance to the study's focus. Over a four-week period, PSSTs engaged in STEM activities designed to align with the science education curriculum. Data collection involved a "Views on STEM Education Questionnaire" developed by the researcher and reviewed by two experts in STEM education. Content analysis was used to analyze the collected data, ensuring reliability through inter-coder agreement assessment. The results indicated that STEM education encompasses not only the four core disciplines but also interdisciplinary interactions. Participants recognized its positive impact on cognitive and psychomotor skills, creative thinking, problem-solving abilities, and its real-world relevance. However, limitations in time, resources, and pedagogical technological content knowledge were noted as potential challenges. Effective STEM instructors were described as possessing strong communication skills, creativity, innovation, and a passion for research. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of STEM teacher candidates' perspectives, shedding light on the importance of interdisciplinary approaches and the qualities required for successful STEM educators.

AB  - Limited empirical research has investigated the impact of interdisciplinary STEM approaches on students' learning with a particular dearth in the area of assessment. A lack of alignment between interdisciplinary approaches in STEM teaching and its assessment strategies is notable. In this study, we adopt an inquiry approach to the ways in which interdisciplinary learning of science and mathematics impacted on student learning through the use of a STEM challenge that involved a real-world task. Two secondary school teachers, one who teaches science and the other mathematics, participated in the study and jointly planned and taught a sequence of science and mathematics lessons using an interdisciplinary approach to their Year 8 class of 24 students over several weeks. Data of students' project reports, video of their project presentation, and teacher interviews were analysed to identify the intersection of disciplinary specific and generic skills in assessment practice of an interdisciplinary task. Our findings highlight the importance of having an assessment rubric with criteria that addressed both disciplinary specific skills as well as generic STEM skills.

AB  - The science education community is deeply invested in growing the next generation of scientists. One way to do this is through evidence-based interventions that support the motivation and performance of students in introductory classes. The literature is replete with interdisciplinary research presenting such interventions. Unfortunately, the process of developing and evaluating pedagogical practices is not the same as the process required to scale those efforts into actual university classrooms. Efforts to spread the word about successful practices often move slowly, through relatively small personal and professional networks. We present a complementary proactive strategy designed to raise awareness of one exemplar intervention across a broad swath of U.S. biology faculty. Our 30-minute anonymous engagement (in three 10-minute asynchronous virtual sessions) resulted in this particular intervention being adopted in some form by more than 4 in 10 faculty who learned about it, reaching an estimated 7,500 students across the United States. We describe the three phases of our intervention adoption process, each informed by social psychology theories of persuasion and decision-making, and provide a detailed guide and ready-to-use resources to replicate the process using other evidence-based interventions ready for scale.

AB  - This article examines the opportunities and challenges for the use of ICT in science education in the light of science teachers' Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). Some of the variables that have been studied with regard to the TPACK framework in science classrooms (such as teachers' self-efficacy, gender, teaching experience, teachers' beliefs, etc.) are reviewed, and variations of the TPACK framework specific for science education are expounded upon. In the conclusion, some of the aspects of TPACK in science education that need to be addressed in future are indicated, including the development of subject specific ICT-based resources and e-learning platforms; training to develop science teachers' integrated skills for the implementation of ICT in their subject teaching; the importance of the continuous encouraging of science teachers' for their participation in inservice training related to the use of ICT; and the examination of the role of science teachers' TPACK in the developing of students' 21st century trans-disciplinary skills.

AB  - Teacher performance has been linked with both self-efficacy and subject knowledge confidence suggesting that it is important to address these aspects within initial teacher training programmes. This study investigated the development of pre-service teacher's science and engineering subject knowledge confidence and teaching self-efficacy following participation in a paired-peer, multidisciplinary STEM project and assesses which aspects of the work may have resulted in any changes observed. A group of 10 pre-service teachers were paired with undergraduate engineering students to develop science through engineering challenges and to enact these with children. Multimethod pre and post evaluation assessed the impact of participation on the subject knowledge confidence and teaching self-efficacy levels of the pre-service teachers, alongside qualitatively exploring possible reasons for any changes. Results indicated that significant increases in both subject knowledge confidence and teaching self-efficacy had occurred. In exploring which aspects of the work may have contributed to these changes, data suggested that the paired-peer aspect of the project may have been beneficial. Immersing pre-service teachers in similar collaborative projects early in their career may provide opportunities to shape positive dispositions towards STEM subjects for pre-service teachers and so evaluations of how this can be built into teacher training programmes are required.

AB  - Teamwork skills are an important part of business school curriculum typically taught using project-based experiential methods. This paper presents best practices for teaching teamwork skills to Gen Z students using a project-based learning, peer mentoring approach. With experiential learning theory as a guide, an interdisciplinary process was developed between an introductory programming course and a capstone business project management course to improve experiential learning and overcome issues like the free-rider problem. The opinions and sentiments of peer mentors were examined using text analysis and sentiment analysis. Peer mentoring between two interdisciplinary courses was found to reduce the free-rider problem and was beneficial for both classes.

AB  - Building from a panel at the 2022 National Communication Association (NCA) annual convention, the present article seeks to ground communication studies/sciences as central to interdisciplinary conversations surrounding sexuality education and communication. Communication is integral to sexuality education, and topics of communication, sex, and sexuality education are researched across disciplines. Still, research on sexuality education within communication studies remains under-attended, and interdisciplinary sexuality education research remains siloed by academic discipline. Presenting a forum featuring both emerging and leading scholars in the field of communication researching sex(uality) education, the present article seeks to establish the academic discipline of communication as integral to research on sexuality education. To do so, we first discuss communication as an academic discipline and its advancements in sexuality education research. Next, communication scholars offer their expertise in sex(uality education) communication topics including family conversations, cultural influence, health inequities in education, and medicine. Collectively, these perspectives offer an understanding of current sexual health research in the field of communication, as well as next steps through direct application to conversations about sex, improvement to our medical and education systems, and community-based education and intervention. It is our hope that this article fosters a larger conversation about the importance of communication (studies/sciences) in sexuality education.

AB  - The professional high school by the federal schools in Brazil requires an integrated curriculum itinerary. There is a lack of information about how to achieve that in a practical conception of integration. This article aimed to investigate the interdisciplinary approach of the content "transformation of energy" involving the relationship among Science, Technology, Society, and Environment (STSE) in integrated high school. The applied research procedure was a pedagogical intervention in which research subjects were the third year high school students, integrated into the technical course in food (n = 36) at the Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Norte, municipality of Pau dos Ferros, Brazil. The process of planning, execution, and evaluation of the interdisciplinary teaching sequence was carried out by teachers and researchers from different areas i.e., forest engineering, chemistry, physics, and physical educational. The data were compiled and evaluated through thematic analysis. The results showed that interdisciplinary learning favors scientific and environmental literacy, conceptual changes, expanded discussions, and the integration of the curriculum.

AB  - Although science education and mathematics education share many characteristics as neighboring research disciplines, comparisons between the two research fields in the literature have rarely been made. In this study, we examine the two fields' similarities and differences in the local context of South Korea by analyzing 2,426 research articles published in 15 selected local journals from both fields. The analysis revealed interesting commonalities and divergences across the two fields, suggesting a high degree of similarity in the distribution of research topics across the two fields. Nevertheless, some topics were more frequently studied in one field than the other. Based on the results, we suggest that understanding the ongoing research agendas and aims of adjacent disciplines such as mathematics education will be beneficial to the science education community by allowing self-reflection and facilitating interdisciplinary communication and collaboration. Several potential ways in which the two disciplines can cross-fertilize are discussed.

AB  - The intersection of Data Science (DS) and Library and Information Science (LIS) is rapidly developing, with a notable need for ongoing transdisciplinary training between practitioners in these two fields. The LIS Education and Data Science Integrated Network Group (LEADING) fellowship program and its ancillary community of practice (CoP) showcase a unique response to this continuing learning need. In order to assess the impact of the fellowship and CoP, this study utilized a sequential mixed methods design, which adapted the value creation framework (VCF) to examine participants' engagement with, and their perceived value of, their LEADING experience. Using the five indicators of the VCF (immediate, potential, applied, realized, transformative) and DEI-centered values, the study results show clear evidence of themes that are reported in the literature as highly influential in CoP value perception (connectedness, emotional engagement, and community values).

AB  - Background: The high rates of attrition in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) programmes causes concern over a future shortage of graduates entering STEM careers. Students' first year experiences critically affect their motivation and are therefore also critical components of students' academic success in terms of retention, learning and subsequent performance. Purpose: This study explores STEM students' encounters with an interdisciplinary first year. Specifically, motivational patterns towards learning in two introductory courses followed by students from multiple study programmes are investigated. Sample: 173 Danish undergraduate students enrolled in three science programmes: biomedicine; biochemistry and molecular biology; and physics. Design and methods: Within the framework of Self-Determination Theory, a measure of autonomous and controlled motivation forms the basis for quantitative analyses (n = 173). A qualitative thematic analysis of students' open responses further supplements and gives nuance to the findings. Results: The motivational pattern of physics students is found to differ significantly from that of biochemistry and molecular biology (BMB) students and biomedicine students. The comments reveal that some students struggle to realise the relevance of the course content for their chosen study programme to an extent that makes them reconsider their study choice. Conclusions: The study offers input to the discussion of how to present inter- and/or multidisciplinarity to students and points to implications on two levels: curriculum design and course content. The findings are of importance to educational planners, decision-makers and teachers dealing with the motivational range that exists within their courses.

AB  - The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) proposes to enhance active learning and student protagonism in order to improve academic performance. In this sense, different methodologies are emerging to create scenarios for self-regulation of their learning. In this study the cooperative, collaborative and interdisciplinary learning methodologies were compared in Spanish universities. The main objectives were to evaluate their effects in higher education and to explore the relationship between perceived group cooperation and self-perceived ability to work in a group, differences between educational Spanish contexts, educational methodologies and gender. To this end, a quasi-experimental design was carried out. Data analysis included the descriptive metrics, correlations and analysis of variance to evaluate the differences among pedagogical methods, their effects on cooperative learning, teamwork outcomes and gender differences, comprising a total of 229 students in Spain from Psychology, Early Childhood Education, Primary Education and Computer Engineering completed the two questionnaires. Results showed that the highest correlation between perceived cooperative activity and self-perceived ability to work in a group was found among computer science students, especially among women, suggesting that the interdisciplinary learning focused on software tool development may be the most effective methodology to improve teamwork and cooperative learning outcomes. Despite these findings concern only to Spanish universities, limiting the generalizability of results, the interdisciplinary methodology seems promising for improving both teaching quality and teamwork skills. The learning methodologies of interdisciplinary projects may therefore need to be implemented within the framework of cooperative and collaborative methodologies.

AB  - Previous research of inquiry-based learning in natural science education indicates that there are different methodological trends and paradigms in the study of these issues. The aim of this research has been to analyze the selected relevant studies on inquiry-based learning in natural science education in order to assess their scope and limitations in the light of educational changes and reform initiatives. Directions of analysis of the relevant studies include considerations of the following: 1) Theoretical starting points and specific conceptual solutions, 2) Methodological design (research questions / problems, methods, techniques, and procedures), as well as 3) (Re)interpretation of the most significant findings. It could be stated that studies on inquiry-based learning in the field of natural sciences are rather insufficient, very diverse and heterogeneous, differing from each other both in terms of theory and conceptual solutions, research problems, methodological design, and implications for educational work. Even though experiments are very common in natural sciences, it has been found that triangulation is often used as a combination of qualitative and quantitative paradigms. The common thread that connects the selected studies in this field is the recognition of importance of inquiry-based learning as a very promising model of active teaching the natural sciences. It could be concluded that such studies require an interdisciplinary approach to the subject of study, both in empirical and theoretical field, providing better understanding of the future research directions of this phenomenon.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research provides new insight beyond a singular epistemological and methodological framework. Such collaboration can help increase readership outside a narrow disciplinary angle. Likewise, working with scholars outside one's field can help address new questions using a multidimensional approach. However, working within an interdisciplinary department can produce challenges, especially within small departments. Existing literature has addressed several challenges for academics working in small departments, including increased workload, limited course releases, and limited funding. This article addresses the professional isolation from working in a small interdisciplinary department and provides strategies to overcome these challenges.

AB  - STEM, STEAM education is important for building a better future, and teachers have a key role in attracting students to the field of STEM. However, when teachers need to shift from traditional disciplinary-based education to integrated STEM education, they often find this transition challenging. This difficulty arises because their beliefs about science teaching and learning are deeply rooted in traditional disciplinary-based approaches. Beliefs have a profound influence on their teaching practises as well as their professional development, even though teachers are often not conscious of their own beliefs. To address this issue, we employed a phenomenological approach to investigate the phenomena when their beliefs espoused by asking formative episodes that influenced their development as science teachers. This study aimed at exploring the current subject-specific beliefs of in-service science teachers. This told us how best to guide teachers through this process of the transition from traditional disciplinary-based education to STEM education. Our findings revealed that teachers' beliefs showed that curiosity and/or interest towards science to be the most important factors in student learning. This indicates that while teachers' core beliefs are not entirely disciplinary-oriented, they are more open. It would reduce their anxiety and low self-efficacy in conveying STEM education.

AB  - The objective of ESD is to make people think differently about lifestyles as well as economic and political structures, to raise awareness for complex problems, to sharpen political judgment and to empower people to act. A means to achieve these objectives is to engage students in action-oriented learning. The ESD courses aimed at implementing transdisciplinary projects to go beyond the acquisition of knowledge about sustainable development but to make students act. The courses were in line with ESD objectives but came with specific challenges particularly with regard to implementing real life projects.

AB  - This article describes and illustrates a physics course for first-year college students whose only knowledge of physics is that they do not like the subject. The physics content is driven entirely by what appears in the daily newspapers and generally covers most physics topics in a semester. This course was structured as a learning community that combined English and physics in a single 6-credit course. Most of the writing assignments were about physics. A semester-long overview is shared, as is the instructional model for Newspaper Physics. We also provide three examples of how this model is used. Findings indicate that students gained higher physics content knowledge, higher-order thinking skills, greater confidence in seeking help and understanding science, and more opportunities to work with peers outside of class. This study contributes community-based interdisciplinary teaching and learning strategies.

AB  - Long-standing calls have been initiated to attend to equity in student achievement in and through science. Science teacher educators can aid these efforts by identifying effective science teaching strategies and supporting K-12 science teachers in integrating those into their practice. Scholars argue for an equity-driven lens to be central in teacher education for reform efforts to be fully effective in ensuring high quality education for all students. The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) undergird current U.S. reform efforts and are noted for more explicitly addressing issues of equity than past standards, but still noted as limited as equity is not sufficiently central. Additionally, "reflexivity" is encouraged with reforms, where thorough understanding is derived of effectiveness and challenges of past and current practices before implementing changes. Altogether, these issues inform the current study: an exploration of the ways in which science teachers work to implement NGSS-aligned instruction within a professional development context where an equity-driven lens is not explicit, seeking to identify evidence of how current practice facilitated or aligned with equity-driven practices. This inquiry will serve to guide future efforts to build on and transform current practice to more centrally address equity in science education.

AB  - In elementary education, virtual reality (VR) has been the subject of muchincreased research over the last ten years, with developed and developing nations making significant contributions. This research used a bibliometric approach to examine all publications published between 1994 and 2023, depending on this information. This study uses the VOS viewer tool and the Scopus database to analyse 365 articles. The results show that developed nations significantly contributed to publications and citations, especially in research and development, whereas developing nations were more interested in using technology in education. Journals in computer science and education now receive the most citations, which indicates the current focus on Virtual Reality in Elementary Education. The trend of greater collaboration among authors may be attributed to several variables, including, but not limited to, enhanced financing, higher author competency, and the rise of transdisciplinary studies. This collaborative effort facilitates the exchange of many viewpoints, expands the scope of insights in articles, and improves the editing and revising process. The terms "child," "reality," "technology," "approach," "intervention," "teaching," "augmented reality," "difference," "patient," and "process" are the top 10 keywords linked to virtual reality in elementary school research. Research relevance, influence, and acknowledgment within the scientific community may be ensured by matching research to keyword trends. The findings of this study could help future investigators choose research topics and pinpoint areas of interest.

AB  - Multidisciplinarity and the enrichment of science and mathematics education toward the so-called STEAM-approach where the A stands for art, has raised a lot of academic interest in the past decade. In this study, 5th and 6th graders from the greater Helsinki area (N = 390) participated in a several months long, Mars-colonization themed STEAM-learning intervention. Testing the students' science knowledge using pre- and post-tests, their learning outcomes were compared to those of 5th and 6th graders from a control school (N = 119), who during the same period studied STEM-subjects in a more traditional manner. The main factors that were taken into account during the comparisons were gender and academic achievement level. Based on only whether there was any improvement between the pre- and post-test scores, girls were found to have benefitted from the Mars-module more than boys did. While also considering the magnitude of the said improvement, no significant difference in the effectiveness of the learning module was found between genders. The group of academically highest-achieving students improved their test scores the most after participating in the STEAM-learning module. This is an important, somewhat surprising finding, as often informal, outside of school learning has been found to benefit especially students with lower grade point averages.

AB  - Chemistry, with its related technical applications, is of crucial importance for creating a sustainable future. Without chemistry, current challenges will be difficult to solve. Such problems include meeting most of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) announced by the United Nations and adherence to planetary limits, for example, novel chemical substances being released to the environment, biochemical flows, and climate change. Such challenges can, however, only be solved via transdisciplinary approaches. They can never be fully explored by a single discipline only, either in reality or in the context of teaching and learning. In order to strengthen education for sustainable development (ESD), we suggest including geographical perspectives in science education. Geography commits itself to the analysis of human-environment systems and combines social perspectives with those found in the natural sciences. In our opinion, such an approach can increase the educational value of science learning, e.g. in the case of chemistry education. An exploratory interview study with twelve purposefully selected chemistry teachers was recently conducted in order to explore chemistry teachers' views on implementing geographical perspectives. This study reveals that German chemistry teachers view such inclusion as generally positive, but also recognize limitations in the approach due to curricular and time constraints.

AB  - Physics and mathematics represent closely intertwined fields, wherein physicists employ mathematical modeling to address intricate problems. A challenge encountered by physicists involves bridging conceptual understanding with mathematical equations, a task that educators can facilitate by supporting students in navigating these two realms of comprehension. Mathematical modeling has exhibited potential in assisting students in recognizing that the domains of physics and mathematics are not insurmountably complex. The present study investigated the capability of science preservice teachers (PSTs) enrolled in an introductory physics course to resolve real-life physics problems by adhering to the stages of mathematical modeling. Data were gathered through the Interdisciplinary Modeling Eliciting Activity, allowing students to collaboratively discuss problems and devise solutions. Analysis was executed utilizing the interdisciplinary mathematical modeling (IMM) framework. The activity provided an inclusive platform for all students, including those who typically remained reticent during classes, to actively participate in group discussions and articulate their ideas. Despite the successful navigation of the problem with the guidance of the IMM framework, groups encountered challenges in certain tasks such as parsing/grouping and generating a context. Overall, the study demonstrated promise in augmenting PSTs' enthusiasm for physics and enhancing their comprehension of mathematical models within the discipline.

AB  - The Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona) is a world-class research center devoted to understanding fundamental questions about human health and disease. In addition to conducting multidisciplinary research of excellence, IRB Barcelona is committed to maintaining an open dialogue with the public about its work, fostering scientific vocations and promoting scientific culture in society. In this regard, the institute has several public engagement and science education initiatives to reach these goals. In this article, we highlight two projects directed toward primary school and secondary school students, respectively: the Tandem Project and the Crazy About Biomedicine Programme. Although each of these activities has slightly different objectives and target audiences, they share the commitment of the institute to contribute to the science education of young students. We believe that it is the responsibility of research institutes to promote these kinds of initiatives, which have the potential to spark passion for science and thus foster scientific vocations. The new generation of scientists is in our hands.

AB  - For those interested in understanding cultures of learning in both formal and informal science educational contexts, ethnography is often the research approach of choice. Yet ethnography, as a research approach, is far from monolithic. The myriad of nuances, distinctions, and open questions of ethnographic research, employed as full-scale ethnographies or as ethnographically informed approaches to broader qualitative research, can be a source of numerous tensions in science education research and educational research in general. In order to trouble and learn from these tensions, we employed a novel, analytic approach of meta-ethnography. We relied on Bakhtinian dialogic analysis to contrast questions of ethnographic methodology and method across four multidisciplinary studies of learning cultures rooted in varied levels of ethnographic methods. Commonalities in methodological tensions between the studies include the role of the researcher, the temporal scope, and analysis and representation. We proposed an ethnographic continuum as one way to envision our ethnographic studies without bounding them by the traditional nomenclatures.

AB  - Project-based learning (PBL) is a promising teaching method for integrated science education that has gained momentum in educational research and curriculum reforms, especially as a method to enhance 21st century skills and connected worldview. How teachers implement PBL greatly affects students' content understanding and development of skills. The purpose of this qualitative study is to highlight active teachers' PBL practices and their perceptions of the advantages and challenges of implementing PBL to better promote the implementation of PBL in teacher education programs and in integrated science education. This study consisted of two parts: (1) a qualitative-led survey and (2) a case study. First, the data for the survey was collected from January to March 2017 through an online reporting form of an international StarT programme. This programme supports the implementation of interdisciplinary and collaborative PBL in science, mathematics and technology education. 244 teachers from early childhood education to upper secondary school participated from 28 countries. Second, 12 PBL units reported by the teachers were chosen for a case study. The teachers exploited PBL practices that were theme- and inquiry-based, collaborative and engaging to students. However, closer inspection revealed variation and defects in the practices particularly in relation to assessment, using reflection and student-centred approach. In addition, teachers reported several challenges relating to the implementation of PBL. The results indicate that teachers see PBL as beneficial but need support with the implementation. Science teachers' pedagogical competence in PBL could be promoted through collaborative learning in which students, teachers and other participants are learning from each other.

AB  - Climate change (CC) has widespread impacts on human and natural systems and thus threatens the future of contemporary youths. Only a few studies on climate change education (CCE) have been published in Finland, and no research has been conducted on upper secondary education. Thus, this study investigated Finnish university students' views on CCE in upper secondary schools. According to them, the most common goals in CCE are increasing and structuring knowledge, developing thinking skills, and encouraging action both today and in the future. The respondents considered preconceived notions and opinions stemming from their inner circles, the media, and social debate to be the most difficult factor in teaching about CC. CCE was perceived to provide either a weak or relatively weak capacity to follow a climate-friendly lifestyle. By increasing and diversifying teaching and strengthening multidisciplinarity, climate-friendly lifestyles can be improved. The respondents' views on current and future CCE differed most clearly concerning motivation and inclusion, which are not prevalent in contemporary teaching. The results indicate, however, that the university students were motivated to increase and develop CCE, and according their answers, their own capacity to address different aspects of CCE was relatively good.

AB  - Laboratory learning in the life sciences is historically centered around following recipe-like instructions to complete activities with defined outcomes. The American Association for the Advancement of Science's "Vision and Change" report has called for a change in science teaching. The report emphasizes the importance of providing research experiences for students and the need to foster discovery, collaboration, and communication of science by students. In recent years, the course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) has been introduced into science pedagogy. CUREs provide authentic, inquiry-based research experiences to undergraduate students from all backgrounds. There is evidence that CUREs produce students who have more concrete science identities, improved interdisciplinary collaboration and communication skills, and better understanding of the process of doing science compared with traditional courses. Students who participate in CUREs may be more likely than students without an authentic research experience to continue in the sciences. CUREs are often offered as single courses, but multi-semester CUREs increase the potential for undergraduate students to publish and present their science and benefit faculty supporters and their institutions. CUREs have revolutionized laboratory learning in the life sciences. In this article, we offer a review of current literature on the benefits and limitations of CUREs.

AB  - This study presents a conceptual framework for embedding interdisciplinary learning approaches in a postsecondary science program in order to foster interdisciplinary science habits in students. The framework was developed through the lens of a multi-year interdisciplinary postsecondary science program that encompasses a series of courses in which science disciplines are bridged within an authentic science research environment. The validity of the developed framework is supported by the empirical data comprising live experiences of the students obtained through questionnaires, interviews and focus groups. The data were processed and evaluated using content analysis and activity theory. This work provides design principles that will be useful for both program developers and education researchers seeking to launch effective interdisciplinary science programs.

AB  - Undergraduate field courses are important learning experiences in many of the natural sciences, but they are not accessible to many students. Virtual field experiences (VFEs) have been evolving as a plausible alternative. A Delphi study, a method to seek systematic and iterative ideation from experts in a discipline, was conducted to synthesize best practices for achieving specific student outcomes through VFEs. Twenty-six participants with expertise in aspects of VFEs were included in the study and were asked about VFE design considerations and student learning outcomes. Panelists ranked five learning outcomes as most important: soft skills, affective outcomes, sense of being a scientist, interdisciplinarity, and problematization of issues addressed by science. The panel identified five design characteristics as most important for achieving those outcomes: alignment to learning goals, social interaction, attention to student contexts, authenticity, and pedagogical approach. Panelists acknowledged the difficulty of achieving some of these goals through VFEs but emphasized the importance of real-time social interaction with peers and outside experts. They encouraged an asset view of VFEs, highlighting the ability to include more diverse environments and people and to provide an experience catered to specific student needs and contexts.

AB  - This article describes teaching science and dance together as part of a university first-year experience. This was done to address educational challenges including engagement and retention of diverse students, development of scientific literacy, and development of creative artistic expression. We describe team teaching "the Art and Science of Dance," where students learn about asking and answering questions through multiple lenses, learn how to do science, and learn how to dance. We assessed student experiences and found that the course challenges all students, but provides a structure where they are able to actively participate in the generation of scientific knowledge and art by the end of their first semester at college. Therefore, we advocate teaching challenging, multidisciplinary courses to first-year students. Dance collaborations seem to be an especially effective way to do this.

AB  - This study aims to describe the history of interdisciplinary education and the current trends and to elucidate the conceptual framework and values that support interdisciplinary science teaching. Many science educators have perceived the necessity for a crucial paradigm shift towards interdisciplinary learning as shown in science standards. Interdisciplinary learning in science is characterized as a perspective that integrates two or more disciplines into coherent connections to enable students to make relevant connections and generate meaningful associations. There is no question that the complexity of the natural system and its corresponding scientific problems necessitate interdisciplinary understanding informed by multiple disciplinary backgrounds. The best way to learn and perceive natural phenomena of the real world in science should be based on an effective interdisciplinary teaching. To support the underlying rationale for interdisciplinary teaching, the present study proposes theoretical approaches on how integrated knowledge of teachers affects their interdisciplinary teaching practices and student learning. This research further emphasizes a need for appropriate professional development programs that can foster the interdisciplinary understanding across various science disciplines.

AB  - In light of the increasing frequency of misleading information in social media regarding environmental issues, this study aimed to identify misleading information spread through TikTok videos and to discuss why such content is considered misleading, drawing on relevant literature. Hashtags with large numbers of views, such as #climatechange, #sustainability, #pollution, #biodiversity, #environmentalprotection, #environmentalissues, #energysource, and #environmentalproblems, were used for data collection through web scrapper called Apify (https://apify.com/). A total of 29 misleading videos were found. Content analysis was applied to identify and classify the topics and misleading claims. The topics of misleading videos, according to the most frequent mentions, were energy sources, followed by climate change, pollution, biodiversity, and environmental degradation. Among the misleading claims, videos related to pyramids as nonpollutant power plants and conspiracy related to pollution exhibited the highest frequency. The results show various misleading claims in videos related to environmental topics. Also, emphasized the importance of science education in addressing misleading information. In addition, the importance of an interdisciplinary approach for addressing environmental issues was reinforced.

AB  - Understanding ecological concepts is crucial in tackling environmental issues like climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction. These concepts also serve as a teaching framework, encouraging learners to effect positive change. This research was conducted with grade 9 learners from three schools in Bloemfontein, South Africa, randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. It used a positivist paradigm and Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour as a theoretical framework, incorporating a quantitative experimental research design. The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS), a standardised attitude survey, was administered to experimental and control groups as a pre-and post-test. Data analysis involved descriptive and analytical statistics. Results show a positive influence on learners' applied conceptual understanding of ecological concepts, favouring the experimental group postintervention [F(1,350) = 36.45, p <0.0001] at a 5% significance level. Puppetry, therefore, can create dynamic, interactive learning environments as a teaching tool, enhancing learner engagement, understanding, and appreciation of ecological concepts. It aids in information retention by associating them with unique experiences. This teaching tool can boost learners' positive perspectives on ecology, enabling learners to make informed decisions and contribute to a sustainable environment. This paper aims to contribute to the scholarship of innovative teaching methods and an interdisciplinary approach to science teaching and learning.

AB  - The community engagement project described in this article took the form of the re-invention and re-interpretation of a historic symbol (Diana the elephant) on the Potchefstroom Campus of North-West University (NWU), South Africa. In 2015, the Faculty of Education Sciences invited staff and students to reinterpret the elephant (a symbol of education, longevity, wisdom, care, stamina, memory) in a new and more multicultural, multilingual, inclusive and environmentally conscious South Africa. The participatory process described, and the related outcomes, involved learning by students and academics across disciplines (the conceptualisation, design, engineering and creation of the structure) and collaboration between academics, children and adults from the community, all with a strong service-learning dimension in relation to teacher education.

AB  - In this empirical study, the one-day project Robot Love Design-a-thon was designed for an interdisciplinary group of preservice teachers (in arts, sciences, and primary education), and evaluated through observations and learner reports. An analysis of the observations and the learner reports showed that having to go through a complete design process in a single day worked well: it facilitated the exchange of ideas and critical discussions between students concerning the project's socially engaged theme 'Tenderness and Technology'. In addition, interdisciplinary collaboration emerged as an important learning outcome. All students found working in mixed teams a relevant and educational experience as they could profit from each other's expertise.

AB  - One of the main topics of mathematics education nowadays is teaching applications of mathematics in various fields, which lead in the recent decades to the development of the STEM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), connecting these disciplines using transdisciplinary or interdisciplinary approaches. Applications of mathematics has become important not only from academic point of view, as helping students to understand mathematics, to apply mathematical knowledge in various contexts, and to show the utility of mathematics, but also because mathematics is an integral part of our daily lives. Teachers have an important role in this approach, so it is important to study their attitude towards teaching applications of mathematics and their experience. The research was conducted in 2021 in Israel. The participants are 221 mathematics teachers from post primary schools. The research instrument was a questionnaire developed for this study based on the scientific literature and aimed to find out teachers' opinion about teaching applications of mathematics and their practice in integrating applications in their teaching. The questionnaire contains both closed and open questions. The responses were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. The results of the study show that 42.5% of teachers in Israel are teaching applications of mathematics. Analyzing the answers given by those teachers, who teach applications of mathematics, 47% are teaching applications in physics, 47.5% integrate them in their lessons few times a semester, and 52.1% of them teaching applications through presenting it to the students. In the participants' opinion, the most important benefits of teaching applications of mathematics are arising students' interest for mathematics (44.3%) and motivating students for learning mathematics (34.8%). The most important obstacles of teaching applications of mathematics are time-constrains (30.8%) and lack of teachers' skills to teaching mathematical applications in other disciplines (24.6%).

AB  - A significant problem in today's school science education is that students often perceive fundamental scientific principles and natural laws as isolated pieces of knowledge without connections between them or to natural phenomena. Instead, students too often are engaging in activities which are distinct and do not follow a meaningful learning sequence, thus depriving them of the opportunity to transfer knowledge and build on past experiences make connections between the different fundamental principles of our world. In our work, we proposed to teachers the use of the "Big Ideas of Science", a set of overarching core ideas, as a cross-disciplinary 'backbone structure' for science education that could support their efforts to facilitate students' ability to see and make the connections between previously and newly acquired knowledge as well as between science subjects taught in school classroom and everyday life. The results presented in this paper confirm that teachers indeed found such an approach beneficial for their students and that the "Big ideas Of Science" could contribute in teaching science more effectively.

AB  - Astronomy has great potential to attract children toward science and improve their scientific literacy. However, it has a relatively small presence within the school curricula worldwide. In Chile, home of the world's largest telescopes, astronomy is even more relevant in science education, but the presence of astronomical content within the national curriculum was not studied yet. In this context, this article characterizes the opportunities to learn astronomy within the Chilean science curriculum from grades 1 to 12. A mixed descriptive design with documental analysis is conducted to determine which science learning objectives (LOs) are directly or indirectly related to astronomy and classify them according to astronomical topics, cognitive processes, and Big Ideas in Astronomy. The proportion of LOs related to astronomy within the whole science curriculum and the categories of interest are calculated and compared over the school grades. The results show that the LOs directly related to astronomy are present only in a third of the grades and include a small variety of astronomical topics. Meanwhile, LOs indirectly related to astronomy appear in all grades and include more topics and higher cognitive processes. We discuss the implications of the outcomes and raise some possibilities to promote astronomy literacy through interdisciplinary work.

AB  - It would be safe to say that nearly every student enrolled in college knows someone who has been impacted by cancer. After all, cancer killed nearly 8.2 million people worldwide in 2012 (International Agency for Research on Cancer, 2014). Using this fact as the impetus for change, we decided to make cancer the focus of a "transdisciplinary" (Marshall, 2014) collaborative effort to simulate a reciprocal-learning experience between undergraduate biology and visual art students attending a university in Southeastern Michigan. The goal of the 2015 project was to create an active and authentic collaboration utilizing the university visual arts and biology curricula. By engaging and connecting scientific and artistic critical thinking processes, we wanted to know: could we design a class structure that would enable collaborative teams of art and biology students to create a visual model that represents a hallmark of cancer designed so that the model could also stand alone on artistic merit? In other words, could cancer visualization be transformed into works worthy of gallery display while maintaining scientific accuracy? In this paper we discuss the planning, implementation, results, and impact this work has had upon the way we now envision transdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - This study developed and validated an assessment that measures interdisciplinary understanding using the topic of carbon cycling, the Interdisciplinary Science Assessment for Carbon Cycling (ISACC). This work was motivated by the need to assess interdisciplinary understanding, defined as the ability to solve problems requiring knowledge and skills from multiple disciplines. Levels of a construct map for interdisciplinary understanding were generated and refined in the construct-modeling design process (Wilson 2005). Key concepts in carbon cycling to be assessed were determined based on experts' concept maps and analysis of the Next Generation Science Standards. The final version of the ISACC includes 11 multiple-choice (MC) items and eight constructed-response (CR) items covering nine key concepts. Of these 19 items, six are single-disciplinary items and 13 are interdisciplinary items. Four hundred fifty-four students in grades 9-16 were recruited and administered the ISACC. For the CR items, scoring rubrics were developed and used by a group of evaluators to code student responses. Two item response theory models, a two-parameter logistic model and a generalized partial credit model, provided evidence of the construct validity of the items. All items reflected unidimensionality and local independence and showed moderate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.782). All except one were a good fit to the models. The findings suggest that the ISACC is a promising tool to assess interdisciplinary understanding of carbon cycling. Future directions include research into test fairness across gender and ethnic/racial groups and further development to cover typical high school students' knowledge more thoroughly.

AB  - The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) education communities are increasingly facing challenges caused by social, technological, economic, environmental, and political changes. Addressing these issues requires AEC educators and practitioners to systematically rethink and reform many of their current practices. Anecdotal evidence in AEC education already exists with respect to pedagogical improvements made by individual technologies such as immersive computing, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data, cyberinfrastructure, and photogrammetry. However, an effective learning-centered environment is more complex than what any single technology can accomplish. In addition, the relationship between technology-intensive learning and digital inequity in AEC education remains, to the most extent, unclear. We envision the next-generation learning-centered environment for AEC education to be technology-intensive, interdisciplinary, industry-linked, and equitable. This paper aims to present a shared vision of the next-generation learning-centered environment for AEC education. To achieve this goal, two interrelated workshops were organized with the participation of different stakeholders, including researchers, educators, and professionals from multiple disciplines of architecture, engineering, construction, computer science, learning science, education, and social sciences. This paper is based on the combined outcomes of the two workshops, organized in four themes: (1) AEC curricula and industry practice, (2) technology and learning, (3) interdisciplinary education, and (4) digital inequity. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by creating a pathway to timely reflect on new learning strategies, new technologies, and future industry and societal needs in AEC curricula, thus producing a more adaptive AEC workforce for the 21st century. The findings of this work can be adopted by educators to develop a roadmap for creating the shared vision of the next-generation learning-centered environment for AEC education.

AB  - This study aims to examine the impact of interdisciplinary computational thinking (CT) skills training on primary school teachers' perceptions of CT skills. The sample of the study consisted of 30 primary school teachers in Istanbul. In this study, where quantitative and qualitative methods were used together, qualitative data were obtained from the teacher identification form. Quantitative data were obtained from the scale for CT skills. After the pre-test was applied to the study group, "CT Skills Training" was applied. During the training, the basic concepts of CT skills and the subskills were covered theoretically and practically. From the quantitative data, the education applied was determined to have had a positive effect on the primary school teachers' perceptions of CT skills. From the qualitative data, it was determined that the participants had a positive opinion about the applied training and thought that they gained skills related to CT.

AB  - A shift from teaching to learn to learning to think is necessary to promote critical thinkers. Since teachers tend to replicate the educational models they have experienced as students, new references are needed. In order to address these concerns, we present an interdisciplinary intervention in initial teacher education and analyse its impact on teachers' critical thinking and awareness of the importance to promote it. The intervention is based on the potential of socio-scientific issues to support argumentation and provide meaningful contexts for graph interpretation. The content analysis of participants' responses before and after inquiring about climate change shows an increase in the level of argumentation and the capacity to read beyond data, providing evidence of the development of critical thinking. In addition, pre-service teachers explicitly refer to their future responsibility in preparing students to face current challenges, demonstrating awareness of the need to promote critical thinking.

AB  - Background: Creativity is often viewed as a fundamental educational capability. Science can play a role in nurturing creativity. Research suggests that creative pedagogy, including interdisciplinary teaching , can engage students with science. Previous studies into teachers' attitudes to science and creativity have been largely situated within national educational contexts. Purpose: This study explores educators' perspectives on the relationship between Science and Creativity across national contexts drawn from Europe and beyond. Sample and Methods: A convenience sample of 270 educators, recruited by project partners and via online media, and broadly defined to include teachers, trainee teachers, informal educators and teacher educators, responded to an online survey designed to explore perceptions of the relationship between science and creativity. Exploratory factor analysis of Likert question responses was used to develop a combined attitude scale, with results compared across nationalities and phases of education. Open question responses were analysed thematically to allow nuanced interpretation of the descriptive statistical findings. Results: The findings show broad agreement internationally that science is a creative endeavour, with a small number of educators disagreeing about the relationship between science and creativity in the context of school science. Those who disagreed were usually secondary science teachers, from England, Malta or outside Europe (primarily from the United States). The role of scientific knowledge within creativity in science education was found to be contentious. Conclusions: That educators broadly see science as creative is unsurprising, but initial exploration of educators' perspectives internationally reveals some differences, particularly amongst educators working in formal education, relating to the role of knowledge with respect to creativity in science. With current interest in STEAM education, further investigation to understand potential mediating factors of national educational contexts on teachers' perspectives with respect to the role of disciplinary knowledge(s) in creativity and their interaction in interdisciplinary teaching and learning, is recommended.

AB  - STEM and computer science (CS) education are some of the most important research topics of the last decade. The idea that CS should be a part of STEM is becoming more and more common. The most important goals of integrating CS into STEM are to develop students' computational thinking (CT) and problem-solving skills. STEM education creates a natural context for integrating CT into learning and teaching processes. However, applied studies are needed since the subject is new and open to development. In this study, we designed an interdisciplinary unplugged programming activity to integrate CT into STEM activities which we then implemented in a professional development course (PD) with the participation of STEM teachers. To evaluate the effectiveness, an open-ended questionnaire was given to the teachers and the results were analyzed. Accordingly, the teachers stated that the activity was exemplary in applying the interdisciplinary approach and enabling the perspectives of different disciplines to be seen by other subject-area teachers. Also, using unplugged programming activities in teacher education provides an important example. Teachers who want to conduct unplugged programming activities in their classrooms, learn how to integrate CT into STEM, are interested in the practice to support their students' research skills, and aim to support students' 21st-century skills can also use this activity. The interdisciplinary structure of the activity and its example of integrating CT into STEM will guide practitioners and researchers in the field.

AB  - In this study we explored the experiences of students who completed a project-based, interdisciplinary capstone course that was offered at a large university in Southern Ontario, Canada. To do so, we interviewed students after they completed the course, adopting a constructivist perspective and a phenomenological approach. Interview transcripts were analyzed, resulting in four themes: (1) communication, (2) group dynamics, (3) successes, (4) differences between program requirements. In addition to revealing tension between fostering student autonomy and providing students with support, our findings also demonstrate that students valued the capstone course for the knowledge and experience gained from learning to work as an interdisciplinary unit rather than the tangible output of a given project.

AB  - The term "ocean literacy" originated in the early 2000s from American ocean science researchers and educators to strengthen ocean science education in the national curriculum. Worldwide, it has been adapted to reflect a more multidisciplinary approach to understanding humans' relationships with the ocean. Research from the Understanding Ocean Literacy in Canada national study (2019-2020) (Ammendolia et al., 2020; Glithero, 2020; Hoover, 2020; MacNeil, 2020; Ostertag & Ammendolia, 2020; Yumagulova, 2020) identified ocean literacy as a limiting term, unable to capture the scope of Canadian experiences with the ocean continuum (land, freshwater, coastal areas, sea ice, open ocean), and inadequate in encapsulating different worldviews and across different linguistic communities. We discuss the challenges of contextualizing an international term within Canada and present ideas to move toward more inclusive terminology, examining the challenges still ahead in developing relevant terminology and bridging with international initiatives.

AB  - What pedagogical strategies support students from a refugee background connecting to the natural world? What would these strategies look like for fifteen students participating in a language intensive New Arrivals Program (NAP)? These questions were the focus of a small collaborative project set up to investigate the impact of pedagogical initiatives on building educational and cultural connections, and enhancing educational achievement in science in refugee students. This article focuses on the events and outcomes of an interdisciplinary unit of work based around a newly established school garden. Science, mathematics, English and visual arts are the key learning areas covered. The study involves one gardener, a volunteer community artist and three science and mathematics teacher education academics.

AB  - While many studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between learning in the arts and students' critical thinking disposition, few studies have investigated the influence of an interdisciplinary art-related teaching approach and its correlation with academic student behavior confidence in anatomy and physiology (A&P). Therefore, this study aims to demonstrate the impact of an interdisciplinary approach -- reading, discussion, and drawing on students' academic confidence in undergraduate A&P. The investigation utilized a self-reported pre- and post-survey design to explore the change in confidence in A&P between course entry and exit. Sixty undergraduate students completed surveys while taking an elective course called Medical Literature, Anatomy, and the Arts, at a public state university in Southwest Florida. Results indicate a statistically significant difference in student-reported confidence levels in knowledge and experience of A&P. Additionally, the students' perceptions of the course were positive, citing more engagement and better support from peers and instructor as a result of this interdisciplinary approach. These outcomes suggest that teaching undergraduate students in A&P using medical arts enhances student academic confidence. This study provides encouraging support to existing scholarly work on higher education course design and instructional methods relative to improving student confidence and class engagement in A&P.

AB  - Game-based learning has received significant attention in educational pedagogy as an effective way of increasing student motivation and engagement. The majority of the work in this area has been focused on digital games or games involving technology. We focus on the use of traditional game design in improving student engagement and perception of learning in teaching computer science concepts in higher education. In addition, as part of an interdisciplinary effort, we discuss the interplay between game-based learning in higher education and disciplinary cultures, addressing the lack of empirical evidence on the impact of game design on learning outcomes, engagement, and students' perception of learning.

AB  - The aim of this research was to examine the effects of a new platform for raising the pre-service chemistry and geography teachers' awareness of cooperation possibilities associated with the planning relevant interdisciplinary lesson. The research featured the participation of 16 students of the Faculty of Chemistry and 28 students of the Faculty of Geography of Belgrade University. Two workshops were conducted within the research. During the first workshop the participants worked in small groups on the tasks which served to strengthen their awareness on the relevant science education. The second workshop comprised the jointly planning the interdisciplinary lessons in groups with members of the pre-service teachers of both subjects. The participants' lesson plans contain goals that can be classified as those relevant for the individual and those relevant for society. Half of the lesson plans contained formulations of goals that can be assessed as relevant for certain professions. The activities planned for the attainment of the stated goals support an interdisciplinary approach, encompass the concepts envisaged by the chemistry and geography curricula, and the activities specific to these two subjects.

AB  - Decision making about complex socioscientific issues (SSI) involves recognizing and weighing tradeoffs among conflicting values and stakeholder outcomes. A vital but difficult practice, engaging in tradeoffs allows decision-makers to engage in perspective-taking, and also identify that not all their desired goals may be fulfilled by a policy. However, the science education field has not clearly defined tradeoffs practices or operationalized instruction about tradeoffs. Our primary goal was to define features of a tradeoff practice supported by a literature review and explore undergraduates' tradeoff practices within an interdisciplinary science literacy course focused on SSI decision making. As a result of our analysis, we propose three important features of tradeoff reasoning: internal consistency, multiple perspectives, and alternatives comparison strategies, which represent a broader understanding of specific goals students can achieve and educators can assess. Our work more holistically defines student tradeoff practices across the entire decision-making process and lays a theoretical foundation for researching students' tradeoffs practices in an SSI-context. Our study may aid educators in identifying how students consider tradeoffs when decision making about complex SSI and recognizing challenges to refine educational programming aimed at enhancing students' decision-making skills to support science literacy.

AB  - This article discusses the latest developments of the Sucre4Stem tool, as part of the Sucre initiative, which aims to promote interest in computational thinking and programming skills in K-12 students. The tool follows the Internet of Things approach and consists of two prominent components: 1) SucreCore and 2) SucreCode. SucreCore incorporates an advanced microcontroller packaged in a more compact design and enables wireless connectivity. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming tool, supports two different sets of blocks depending on the education grade, and facilitates wireless communication with SucreCore. At the educational level, Sucre4Stem fosters new group dynamics and encourages students to experiment real-world projects by promoting the "programming to learn" approach to concepts from other disciplines as opposed to the strategy widely applied in schools of "learning to program" in isolation.

AB  - Going beyond ceremony to meaningfully integrate the lived experiences and narratives of Blacks particularly African Americans in the science curriculum, requires pragmatic research methodologies. K-12 science curriculum development neither considered the needs of African Americans nor were developed with Blacks in mind. Many questions arise related to what might be considered important for Blacks to know and moreover, who should make this determination, and from whose perspectives. This research used a multifaceted approach that was interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary in content and methodology. Considerations were given to social, cultural, historical, political, cognitive, and scientific lenses. This particular study explored considerations that led to the creation of two kinds of multimedia products -- video clips and an animation. This research explores how the lived experiences and narratives of African American Gullah Geechee of the southern Coasts of the United States might be integrated into the science curriculum using video clips. This research also investigates the creation of a culturally representative animation to explicate considerations that were made when using the social, cultural, and historical underpinnings of Blacks in America. The research highlights the research methodologies and the meaning of representation, that have important implications for meaningful Black cultural representation in the science curriculum.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is vital for success in numerous domains. However, the nature, definition, and scope of CT are ill-defined, and research on how best to develop CT is very limited. This study focused on how thinking styles and STEM attitudes have effects on computational thinking. Using a proportionate stratified random sampling procedure, 1195 students from two universities were surveyed. A structural equation modeling analysis showed that students' thinking styles and STEM attitudes directly predicted their computational thinking skills and that thinking styles mediated the relationship between STEM attitudes and computational thinking skills. Thinking styles and STEM attitudes are strong predictors of CT skills. Based on the results, we recommended that the conceptualization of CT be broadened to reflect its trans-disciplinary nature within the context of STEM education. This study adds to the limited theoretical understanding of CT and CT-predictors in higher education, which has been studied much less than in K-12 education.

AB  - This paper, presented in three parts, overviews the current understandings of the Earth System and the relatively recent interdisciplinary field of Earth System Science (ESS) from a school education perspective. The representation of ESS in the Australian Curriculum is explored through the Cross Curriculum Priority area of Sustainability and the Australian Curriculum: Science (F-12), although the focus is up to Year 10. Initially the most current ESS framework and concepts (Steffen et al. 2020) are introduced (Part I). In the first of two follow-up journal articles an analysis of the Sustainability Cross Curriculum Priority area and the Australian Curriculum: Science indicated that several key ESS understandings and system-thinking skills were present. How the most current ESS understandings and abilities could lead to a far deeper understanding of the Earth System are then considered and those that may need more attention from students and teachers are highlighted (Part II). The final article outlines several research-informed pedagogies to help learners develop more scientific understandings of the Earth System, and appropriate related abilities (Part III). These Earth System goals and pedagogies needed to be considered in the ACARA review of the Australian Curriculum: Science and the Sustainability Cross Curriculum Priority area -- to that end, this paper was submitted to the appropriate committees. We believe the suggested ESS additions and emphases could comprise one pathway toward a more comprehensive and confident Earth System literacy and a stronger engagement in the Earth and other sciences at every school level, and to the curriculum as a whole. Better-informed, sustainability decision-making and actions by students as today's, and tomorrow's, citizens is the hoped-for outcome.

AB  - Infrared (IR) technologies have been universally acknowledged as a valuable pedagogical tool for exploring novel and abstract scientific subjects in science education. This study explores the roles of IR images played in middle school students' Evidence-based Reasoning (EBR) process in support of the understanding of the heat radiation process. Specifically, we implement image processing algorithms explicitly for the visual artifacts mentioned in students' descriptions of the radiation phenomenon to obtain the numeric representations of their corresponding features. Meanwhile, the quality of those descriptions is further coded with the guidance of the EBR framework for indicating students' understanding levels of the phenomenon. Finally, the associations between the numerical image features and the quality of descriptions are analyzed to examine the effectiveness of the IR visual artifacts in helping students understand the heat radiation process. The analytical results found that the image features are further positively correlated with the quality of the descriptions generated by students for the heat radiation. The results further suggest the IR images have the potential of driving students to think proactively and explore detailed procedural changes in learning the heat radiation process. Finally, our study calls for the integration of interdisciplinary instructional approaches in science education to reduce students' cognitive load and guide learning attention, for example, incorporating visualization and relevant processing approaches to present and analyze the otherwise invisible abstract process to help students make sense related knowledge more easily.

AB  - Though today's problems are interconnected, complicated, and unpredictable, students continue to gain knowledge in discrete, standardized disciplinary silos. When subject integration is discussed in STEM and STEAM (STEM + Arts) literature, there is little consensus on what constitutes or should constitute integration of the disciplines. Pre-service teachers have been shown to teach in ways that combine the methods and skills they gained during their education with an imitation of the manner in which they were taught. This highlights one of the major institutional barriers underlying integrated STEAM education, as most pre-service teachers are taught, and therefore expect to teach, specialized subjects. This case study used a transdisciplinary approach to problem-based learning and invited pre-service teachers to apply integrated STEAM and practices of making to provide solutions addressing student dropout rates in their local district. Findings show the group struggled to move beyond their initial solution, even though it did not adequately address the problem. Further, this research indicates that students need constructive criticism from an outside voice in addition to support from a mentor to increase their engagement and success.

AB  - Design of Mechanism is a standard subject in Mechatronics and Mechanical Engineering majors. Different methods and tools are used by lecturers to teach the subject. In this work, we investigate the impact on the competencies development by implementing a project-based learning methodology in a mechanism course. For this, we analyze the performance of students from two different groups. The first group is taught in a traditional fashion developing a final project just related to the discipline, and the second group is taught in a multidisciplinary context where the final goal is to develop a complex project where the mechanisms subject is one complementary subject with the others. The development of engineering competencies, declared for this course, is presented for both groups through the evaluation of different aspects; also, a survey of satisfaction from the students of both groups is presented. Overall, the results show that the multidisciplinary project-based learning method, having a nonacademic training partner as sponsor and solving a real nonacademic project, improves the development of competencies related to practical applications and increases the motivation and appreciation of the student towards the mechanism learning discipline.

AB  - Systematic studies on the effectiveness of in-service teacher professional development (PD) are important for science education research and practice. Previous studies have mostly focused on certain outcomes of PD, for example, the effectiveness of PD for improving teachers' knowledge or students' learning outcomes. This study, however, explores multiple outcomes of PD, from teachers' change in knowledge and practice and how teacher change influences students' beliefs and ultimately their understanding of interdisciplinary science concepts. The sample included 509 students from 23 classrooms within 5 elementary/middle schools. The results showed that teacher attendance in professional learning communities and interdisciplinary science research related positively to teachers' scores on a pedagogical content knowledge test. Students whose teachers had more than 150 PD hours in the past academic year performed significantly better on an interdisciplinary science test. Follow-up analyses suggested that student understanding of the nature of science possibly mediates the positive effect between PD hours and student understanding of interdisciplinary science concepts.

AB  - This article reports on a modified faculty learning community (FLC) composed of university faculty from science education and a variety of engineering disciplines. This research investigated the efficacy of an intentional, long-term, ongoing, interdisciplinary collaboration to benefit the development of science teacher education, including engineering, across the kindergarten to college spectrum (K-16). The successful implementation of the modified FLC, and systematic structure provided by project leadership, led to beneficial results for both education and engineering faculty members. A multiple case study approach was used to evaluate faculty motivation to participate in an interdisciplinary FLC; whether FLC participation contributed to the professional growth and was able to overcome any challenges for faculty participants; which characteristics of FLCs contributed to project success and mitigated any challenges; and if effective collaboration and overcoming challenges was supported by the overall structure of the modified FLC. Findings indicated that faculty experienced valuable professional growth; with only a minor exception, challenges within groups were able to largely be addressed and did not hinder group progress; and that FLC project leadership structure helped guide groups to successful outcomes. Findings conclude with benefits and advice for others on how to establish successful structured interdisciplinary collaborations and mitigate challenges encountered. Ultimately, FLC projects from this study contributed to the support of K--12 teachers in successfully using the Next Generation Science Standards, including the engineering design component, within their classrooms.

AB  - Purpose: The goals of this research study included evaluating the outcomes of Interdisciplinary Science Threshold Experience (InSciTE) on student experience of science discipline, level of sense belongingness to a large Faculty of Science (FoS), outcomes in learning science literacy skills and whether a student's background played a role in the differences of effects of the high-impact teaching practices. InSciTE was designed to facilitate the transition from high school to a large research-intensive university, and specifically to a FoS with over 6,000 undergraduate students. Design/methodology/approach: The FoS in a Canadian university engaged in the development of a *9 credit program bundling foundational statistics and chemistry courses with integration of aspects of mathematics and biology or physics to create a new first-year, academic interdisciplinary experience called InSciTE. This project-based curriculum emphasized teamwork and leadership, and presented complex interdisciplinary challenges facing today's world. A team-teaching environment consisting of instructors, a lab coordinator and teaching assistants was instrumental for the core InSciTE courses. In addition, the authors utilized a variety of learning practices with interdisciplinary themes to meet the learning outcomes. Course activities included field experience and tours, blended learning and flipped lectures, guest speakers, discovery-based lab activities, group discussions and projects, a capstone research project, and a combination of formative and summative assessments. The authors proposed two hypotheses for the evaluative study; first that the high-impact practices (HIP) will improve students' experiences and belongingness to science faculty, and second that InSciTE facilitates learning of scientific literacy skills. To assess the effectiveness of InSciTE, the authors used two surveys, the first being the Test of Scientific Literacy Skills (TOSLS), which measures skills related to major aspects of scientific literacy: recognizing and analysing the use of methods of inquiry that lead to scientific knowledge and the ability to organize, analyse, and interpret quantitative data and scientific information. The second survey examined student belongingness, motivation and autonomous learning, combined with demographic data questions. Findings: The results suggest that InSciTE students reported higher feelings of relatedness, group membership, and career aspirations and performed better on the TOSLS compared to students in other science courses. Originality/value: As a leader in interdisciplinary science, the FoS at a Canadian university developed a full-year course bundling foundational statistics and chemistry courses with integration of some aspects of mathematics and biology or physics to create a new first-year, academic interdisciplinary experience called InSciTE.

AB  - This study develops a framework to conceptualize the use and evolution of machine learning (ML) in science assessment. We systematically reviewed 47 studies that applied ML in science assessment and classified them into five categories: (a) constructed response, (b) essay, (c) simulation, (d) educational game, and (e) inter-discipline. We compared the ML-based and conventional science assessments and extracted 12 critical characteristics to map three variables in a three-dimensional framework: "construct," "functionality," and "automaticity." The 12 characteristics used to construct a profile for ML-based science assessments for each article were further analyzed by a two-step cluster analysis. The clusters identified for each variable were summarized into four levels to illustrate the evolution of each. We further conducted cluster analysis to identify four classes of assessment across the three variables. Based on the analysis, we conclude that ML has transformed--but not "yet" redefined--conventional science assessment practice in terms of fundamental purpose, the nature of the science assessment, and the relevant assessment challenges. Along with the three-dimensional framework, we propose five anticipated trends for incorporating ML in science assessment practice for future studies: addressing developmental cognition, changing the process of educational decision making, personalized science learning, borrowing 'good' to advance 'good', and integrating knowledge from other disciplines into science assessment.

AB  - A course entitled "Science and Engineering Education: Interdisciplinary Aspects" was designed to expose undergraduate students of science and engineering education to the attributes of interdisciplinary education which integrates science and engineering. The core of the course is an interdisciplinary lesson, which each student is supposed to teach his/her peers. Sixteen students at advanced stages of their studies attended the course. The research presented here used qualitative instruments to characterise students' attitudes towards interdisciplinary learning and teaching of science and engineering. According to the findings, despite the significant challenge which characterises interdisciplinary teaching, a notable improvement was evident throughout the course in the percentage of students who expressed willingness to teach interdisciplinary classes in future.

AB  - The development of science education in many countries is varied and diverse. However, one common goal of science education in the different contexts is the focus on scientific literacy. To promote scientific literacy, the Nature of Science (NoS) is one of the vital components for raising scientifically literate citizens. In view of this, the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA 2000) proposed that all those who are involved in science teaching and learning should have a common view of the NoS. In Nigeria, this view is interpreted to have informed the stronger advocacy for students to develop an understanding of the scientific enterprise as articulated in the nation's policy document and revised science curricular. Therefore, this study aims to examine how NoS is represented in three Nigerian chemistry textbooks. The study draws from the NSTA document and literature--the analytical framework for the representations of NoS aspects, approaches used, and the content relation of NoS in the textbooks. Though comparatively few, the results indicated that NoS aspects of tentativeness, empirical nature, human endeavor, creativity, and imagination were the most cited in all the three textbooks. NoS aspects of theories and laws, subjectivity, and scientific methods were less mentioned, while the interdisciplinary nature of science, use of models, and science as a solitary pursuit were neglected in about two thirds of the textbooks. The results further revealed the dominance of implicit approach, followed by the historical approach used to integrate a few NoS aspects in the textbooks. The content relation of the NoS aspects were more of content-embeddedness than content-generic. Following these results, we conclude that the analyzed textbooks may not be adequate to promote scientific literacy in their present states but have the potential to contribute to scientific literacy among students; if revised to reflect recommendations, this study adds to existing literature on NoS representations in science textbooks.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore how a health-based informal science education course, as part of an elementary undergraduate teacher preparation program, influenced pre-service teachers' ideas about formal and informal science teaching and learning. Additionally, the study explored how the course impacted their understandings of the value of bridging informal science to supplement formal instruction. Qualitative study data were gathered through two (mid- and end-of-semester) focus group interviews with five pre-service teachers enrolled in a health-based informal science course. Analysis of data indicated that the inclusion of informal science education experiences during PST preparation has the potential to support novice teachers' developing ideas about science teaching and learning including ways to connect science to students' lives and make science engaging and meaningful. Findings are reported in four key themes that emerged from the data: (a) formal teacher preparation and informal education, (b) connections between formal and informal science education, (c) personal and professional collaborations, and (d) benefits of informal science education.

AB  - For English as a foreign language (EFL) graduate students in STEM, with the need to publish in an international journal comes the double burden of developing general English language skills and discipline-specific writing skills. To help these students effectively, discipline-specific scientific writing (SW) instruction is necessary but has been scarce in Asian contexts. This study investigates how discipline-specific SW courses were developed for graduate students at a Korean science and engineering university, if the courses were successfully implemented, and what could be done to improve the offering of such courses. The study uses a mixed methods research design, informed by the research paradigm of pragmatism. The dataset used in the present study includes interviews, questionnaire surveys, and performance measurement. Interviews were conducted with six language and five content professors and nine teaching assistants, and 42 students involved in the development and offering of the SW courses. A purposive sampling approach was used in selecting interviewees. In addition, two types of questionnaire surveys were conducted among the students who had taken the courses: 225 participated in the university survey and 312 in the program survey. In addition, a pretest and posttest were given to measure students' improvement in their SW performances. For data analysis, text analysis and descriptive statistics were used. The results show that the courses were well received by all those involved. Students expressed appreciation for their instructor's individual attention and feedback on their writing. Moreover, students' posttest scores showed substantial improvement. On the other hand, the study raises such issues as difficulties in collaboration between the language and content professors and the need to enhance the course's relevance to students' major fields. The study concludes by offering suggestions on how to improve the interdisciplinary aspect of SW courses for STEM students and by providing a recommended model of interdisciplinary collaboration among language and content professors and teaching assistants.

AB  - The cyber security education market has grownup exponentially, with a CAGR of 13.9 % as reported by Data Intelo. The report published by the World Economic Forum 2023 indicates a shortfall of 2.27 million cyber security experts in 2021 across different roles and hence manifest that Skill-based cyber security education is the need of the hour. Cybersecurity as a field has evolved as a multi-discipline, multi-stakeholder and multi-role discipline. Therefore, the need to address formal education with an outcome-based philosophy is imperative to address for a wider audience with varied past training in their formal education. With the Internet becoming an essential part of human life, providing security of data passed over the Internet is becoming increasingly crucial. Therefore, the role in the organization which is quite demanding is to have expertise in handling and configuring network security, a subdomain of cyber security as a priority area. The rapid increase in the network attack landscape is constantly demanding monitoring of network attacks as well as a need to promote collaborative R&D and education in the sphere of cyber security due to a shortage of skilled resources. Platform-based education is a potential direction to achieve the objective and address the skill gap required in cyber security. The present research proposes a comprehensive web-based platform that can be used to communicate, collaborate and practice various use cases in the domain of network intrusion detection tools using machine learning algorithms and to evaluate user experience. The proposed platform CySecLearn is a collection of various functionalities and features that ensure experiential learning, will help the learner to develop critical thinking and expertise in network security and promote digital literacy in the domain of cyber security.

AB  - There is an increasing interest in the integration of computational thinking (CT) in the K-12 curriculum. By integrating CT into other disciplines, the aim is to equip students with essential skills to navigate domain-specific challenges. This study conducts a systematic review of 108 peer-reviewed scientific papers to analyze in which K-12 subjects CT is being integrated, learning objectives, CT integration levels, instructional strategies, technologies and tools employed, assessment strategies, research designs and educational stages of participants. The findings reveal that: (a) over two-thirds of the CT integration studies predominantly focus on science and mathematics; (b) the majority of the studies implement CT at the substitution level rather than achieving a transformation impact; (c) active learning is a commonly mentioned instructional strategy, with block-based languages and physical devices being frequently utilized tools; (d) in terms of assessment, the emphasis primarily lies in evaluating attitudes towards technology or the learning context, rather than developing valid and reliable assessment instruments. These findings shed light on the current state of CT integration in K-12 education. The identified trends provide valuable insights for educators, curriculum designers, and policymakers seeking to effectively incorporate CT across various disciplines in a manner that fosters meaningful skill development with an interdisciplinary approach. By leveraging these insights, we can strive to enhance CT integration efforts, ensuring the holistic development of students' computational thinking abilities and promoting their preparedness for the increasingly interdisciplinary domains of digital world.

AB  - This forum paper is a reflection about the paper written by Valérie Frède and illustrates how it influences my work as a Ph.D. student in education. It focuses mainly on the relationship to knowledge and the clash between student culture and Western science culture in classroom. In this forum paper, I will briefly explain why these two ideas seems important to me, and then use the example of climate education to illustrate why it is important to inform a socioconstructivist and transformative way of teaching in science classroom. It also contributes to assert the responsibility we have, as teachers or researchers, to value youth initial conceptions about consensual concepts like night-and-day cycle or more interdisciplinary or complex issue like climate change. [This paper addresses issues raised in Valérie Frède's "Comprehension of the Night and Day Cycle Among French and Cameroonian Children Aged 7-8 Years" (EJ1226677).]

AB  - In this three-part article we seek to establish connections between the emerging framework of "sustainability science" and the methodological basis of research and practice in science education in order to bring forth knowledge and competences for sustainability. The first and second parts deal with the implications of taking a sustainability view in relation to knowledge processes. The complexity, uncertainty and urgency of global environmental problems challenge the foundations of reductionist Western science. Within such debate, the proposal of sustainability science advocates for inter-disciplinary and inter-paradigmatic collaboration and it includes the requirements of "post-normal science" proposing a respectful dialogue between experts and non-experts in the construction of new scientific knowledge. Such a change of epistemology is rooted into participation, deliberation and the gathering of extended-facts where cultural framings and values are the hard components in the face of soft facts. A reflection on language and communication processes is thus the focus of knowledge practices and educational approaches aimed at sustainability. Language contains the roots of conceptual thinking (including scientific knowledge) and each culture and society are defined and limited by the language that is used to describe and act upon the world. Within a scenario of sustainability, a discussion of scientific language is in order to retrace the connections between language and culture, and to promote a holistic view based on pluralism and dialogue. Drawing on the linguistic reflection, the third part gives examples of teaching and learning situations involving prospective science teachers in action-research contexts: these activities are set out to promote linguistic integration and to introduce reflexive process into science learning. Discussion will focus on the methodological features of a learning process that is akin to a communal and emancipatory research process within a sustainability scenario.

AB  - Against a backdrop of advocacy for interdisciplinary STEM curricula, this paper explores the design principles underpinning a three-year longitudinal research project that develops and evaluates interdisciplinary mathematics and science learning sequences involving multiple teachers and student cohorts across the primary school years. The research uses design-based methodology and deploys a pedagogical cycle based on representation construction and model-based reasoning, reflecting core disciplinary processes, and aimed at foundational concepts. The interdisciplinary structure of sequences in different topics, teacher pedagogy, and student reasoning and learning are illustrated through analysis of three learning sequence vignettes. In these topics both mathematical learning (measure, data modelling and spatial reasoning) and science learning (concepts and practices), were reinforced and enriched through the interdisciplinary framing. Drawing on notes of teacher planning and review meetings, coupled with classroom data, we identify (a) the conceptual and curricular design features through which mathematics and science can synergistically interweave, (b) the epistemological design challenges involved in working with teachers to achieve this interdisciplinary alignment, and (c) the key pedagogical design features that emerged to support this integration. The research contributes to conceptualising how interdisciplinary processes that enable synergistic interweaving of mathematics and science content and processes can be effectively framed and enacted.

AB  - In recent years, several innovations have emerged in the field of education, including Blended-Learning, Massive Open Online Courses, Flipped Classroom and Gamification. In particular, several investigations have highlighted the effectiveness of student response systems, or clickers, in different subjects and disciplines. Although some literature reviews have been published on this subject, none of them offer a review of a large volume of publications from a multidisciplinary approach. Similarly, in the literature there are no studies that have analyzed scientific collaborations on this subject. To respond to these concerns, we proposed the use of a bot to retrieve information from a large number of papers (1696 documents co-authored by a total of 4091 researchers) included in the Scopus database. The disciplines covered include natural sciences, engineering and technology, medical and health sciences, agricultural and veterinary sciences, social sciences and humanities, and the arts. The review of the literature reveals that student response systems are generally well-perceived by teachers and students in all the disciplines. Another interesting result achieved from visual data obtained using network visualization software and word clouds is that student response systems are mainly used in some disciplines, such as physics, chemistry, medicine, and nursing. It is clearly observed that the relationship between researchers from the same country is stronger than between researchers from different countries. Finally, some reflections are included on the role of student response systems in online teaching, especially regarding the changes experienced after the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The Integrated Concentration in Science (iCons) 4-year program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst was designed to promote interdisciplinary STEM collaboration in the solution of real-world problems and encourage student independence and interdependence through a student-centered teaching approach that structures all projects as group endeavors. Researchers evaluated the first- and second-year courses to determine whether instructors implemented the student-driven curriculum as planned and how students perceived the courses with respect to pedagogy and collaboration experiences. Results of a mixed-methods study that included observations, interviews, and surveys showed that instructors implemented a student-centered approach as planned; provided help only when students asked for it or obviously needed scaffolded support; and answered most student queries with questions intended to promote discussion, research, and reframing. Students expressed satisfaction with the courses and felt their experiences aligned with their expectations of receiving more guidance than direct instruction. At the end of each course, students confirmed that they had, in fact, received good guidance, feedback, and critique from their instructors and little in the way of lectures. Students also expressed that their collaboration skills improved, especially in the areas of group communication and sharing their ideas.

AB  - The authors present a model for program-wide assessment of the effectiveness of writing instruction in a chemistry laboratory course. This model, which involves collaboration between faculty from chemistry, the Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) program, and the Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning, is based on several theories and established practices from science education and WAC. Multidisciplinary experts scored writing samples and debriefed their findings. The quantitative and qualitative feedback prompted the modification of writing objectives and the realignment of course assignments. The interdisciplinary and collaborative process described could be implemented in a wide range of courses to provide insights on curricular effectiveness and tailor writing assessments to course writing objectives.

AB  - The pervasiveness of Computer Science (CS) in today's digital society and the extensive use of computational methods in other sciences call for its introduction in the school curriculum. Hence, Computer Science Education is becoming more and more relevant. In CS K-12 education, computational thinking (CT) is one of the abused buzzwords: different stakeholders (media, educators, politicians) give it different meanings, some more oriented to CS, others more linked to its interdisciplinary value. The expression was introduced by two leading researchers, Jeannette Wing (in 2006) and Seymour Papert (much early, in 1980), each of them stressing different aspects of a common theme. This paper will use a historical approach to review, discuss, and put in context these first two educational and epistemological approaches to CT. We will relate them to today's context and evaluate what aspects are still relevant for CS K-12 education. Of the two, particular interest is devoted to "Papert's CT," which is the lesser-known and the lesser-studied. We will conclude that "Wing's CT" and "Papert's CT," when correctly understood, are both relevant to today's computer science education. From Wing, we should retain computer science's centrality, CT being the (scientific and cultural) substratum of the technical competencies. Under this interpretation, CT is a lens and a set of categories for understanding the algorithmic fabric of today's world. From Papert, we should retain the constructionist idea that only a social and affective involvement of students into the technical content will make programming an interdisciplinary tool for learning (also) other disciplines. We will also discuss the often quoted (and often unverified) claim that CT automatically "transfers" to other broad 21st century skills. Our analysis will be relevant for educators and scholars to recognize and avoid misconceptions and build on the two core roots of CT.

AB  - In this study, the effects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) focused Arduino practical activities on problem-solving and entrepreneurship skills were analysed using qualitative and quantitative methods. Also, the contribution of these activities to teacher candidates and their effects on the learning-teaching process were discussed by evaluating their views. The study group consisted of 31 final-year teacher candidates studying in the science teaching department of a university in Turkey. The quantitative findings reveal that STEM-focused Arduino practical activities have a positive effect on improving the problem-solving and entrepreneurship skills of teacher candidates. Their opinions also support these results. The teacher candidates stated that the practical activities contribute to their professional development, support the development of 21st-century skills such as problem-solving and creativity and positively affect the learning-teaching process. As a result, STEM-focused Arduino practical activities are of significance in terms of adopting an interdisciplinary approach to education following the requirements of the century and developing problem-solving, entrepreneurial and productive individuals.

AB  - Postsecondary curriculum is designed to prepare students for their careers following graduation, which traditionally revolves around technical aspects of their respected career field. Capstone courses were introduced to help ease students' transition from the university into their careers. However, little research containing empirical evidence exists on the effectiveness of capstone courses in natural resources. This study evaluated 6 yr of course graduates from an interdisciplinary problem-solving capstone course in natural resources, seeking to understand the skills gained and what portions of the course were most useful in transitioning students to their future careers. Results show the course was able to enhance students' writing, communication, job preparation, and teamwork skills. Students valued knowledge gained on soft skills, such as communication and teamwork, over technical skills specific to their major. Overall, the students valued the interdisciplinary problem solving nature of the course, as most natural resource issues are interdisciplinary. Areas that could be improved in this capstone model were focused on improving individual student's verbal communication and presentation skills. Information from this study is useful to colleges and universities considering and using capstone courses to determine skills that can be taught and to determine if using real world problems in an interdisciplinary setting in their courses would be beneficial.

AB  - Our population is aging, calling for communities to be more age friendly and younger individuals to be more aware of aging issues that will impact their personal and professional lives. However, colleges provide few opportunities for students to prepare themselves for a more age-diverse world. Drawing on a new general education core curriculum that calls for students to gain and integrate information within four different knowledge perspectives, we describe a multidisciplinary course that uses information from the physical and social sciences to examine age-friendly community problems and solutions. Topics included environmental health, industrial ecology, and sustainable energy in the context of social-psychological well-being across the life span. Research activities and design projects gave students hands-on opportunities to apply multidisciplinary approaches to complex problems and gain age-related knowledge. Evaluations indicated that the course successfully accomplished its learning objectives, and several lessons were learned about delivering an age-friendly, multidisciplinary course.

AB  - Background: The goal of this research was to determine students' perceived self-efficacy in science classes through involving students in expanding disciplinary core idea (DCI) and interdisciplinary core idea (ICI) maps, as a method to visualize knowledge (utilizing mind mapping and concept mapping) to support students to integrate interdisciplinary learning. The research involved (a) creating (by science educators) eight curriculum-related, disciplinary core idea maps and two interdisciplinary core idea maps; (b) teachers guiding students in an experimental group, to make interdisciplinary connections so as to expand DCI and ICI maps in an intervention lasting a year and a half from grade 10 to 11; (c) providing feedback on students' developed DCI and ICI maps; (d) administering questionnaires seeking students' perceptions about their self-efficacy towards core ideas, both before and after the intervention and (e) interviewing science teachers (5) and selected students (25), after the intervention, about their perceptions towards the use and outcomes of their DCI and ICI maps. Besides the experimental group, a control group (no intervention) was involved. Results: Outcomes showed that the intervention (guiding students in creating disciplinary and interdisciplinary core idea maps to visualize their learning) supported students significantly in their perceived self-efficacy in the fields of Life Science and Earth Science, plus in the use of Models and Systems. In Physics and Chemistry, the students' perceived self-efficacy was not statistically significantly positive after the conducted intervention. This stemmed from disciplinary core ideas, related to Physics and Chemistry, being more abstract, with students making fewer connections and integrating less new knowledge into the related DCI and ICI maps. In the interviews, both teachers and students stated that the intervention (including expansion of DCI and ICI maps) supported students' science learning. Conclusions: Creating and expanding disciplinary and interdisciplinary core ideas more clearly indicates students' learning, through their ability to make meaningful connections, enabling students to raise their self-efficacy in preparing for their future. The results from this research demonstrate that students' perceived self-efficacy can occur through knowledge visualization by expanding both DCI and ICI maps enabling the making of greater interdisciplinary connections.

AB  - This article presents a synopsis of an interdisciplinary literacy-science, cross-country, fully remote service-learning (S-L) project prompted by and executed during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The article shares discussions, analyses, and evaluations from both community partners (staff of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences at Whiteville) and university faculty (education studies professors from Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas) to highlight how the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic created unique opportunities for S-L. With summary of the S-L partnership's fully online development and comparisons to other, more traditional S-L projects completed pre-COVID-19, we offer readers logistical tips for navigating their own virtual S-L partnerships. The article concludes with student learning outcomes from pre- and postproject reflections and identification of interdisciplinary work benefits from both the professors and community partners.

AB  - "A third space" can be unlocked through collaborative efforts between out-of-school organisations (like museums) and schools. By bridging museum and school contexts, blurring boundaries between disciplines and shifting between multiple perspectives on a subject, a "third space," can contribute to meaningful science education. However, resources that support collaboration between museum educators and teachers are required. The educational design of a "third space" between museums and schools can enable "an experience" informed by context-based, interdisciplinary, and value-centred teaching strategies. This study conceptualises and validates the "Alma-Löv-Programme" ("ALP"), a museum resource designed to support students' interdisciplinary, and value-centred learning in a "third space." It applies an art-based teaching strategy that encourages student groups to address science issues depicted by contemporary art. Comparison of the "Alma-Löv-Programme" design guidelines to the design instantiations of the established "Framework for Museum Practice" showed that they are largely consistent. However, noted distinctions indicate several factors that may be important for preparation and exploration of a "third space." The findings can inform the design of activities and programmes by educators in the out-of-school sector.

AB  - Focusing on health education as its context, this article considers the question of how to equip students with strategies to identify and resist misinformation. In doing so, it confronts a key problem for health services nationally and globally, which is the problem of entrenched compartmentalisation. The relationship between these two key issues is explored with reference to a workshop on health misinformation. The workshop was designed through co-creation with researchers in education and was trialled with foundation-level students studying biomedical science and pharmacology. Feedback from participating students included that the workshop provided valuable aspects of interdisciplinary learning that they felt were 'missing' from their education to date. The article concludes by discussing the opportunity for science education in schools and colleges to address and potentially head off problems that persist beyond school and that are recognised to need urgent attention in health discourse.

AB  - Creating authentic science assessments that engage students in conceptual understanding and provide evidence of their learning is challenging. Student-centered instruction and assessments provide an opportunity to build student agency and foster positive student relations with science. This qualitative work showcases assessments that focus on knowledge-in-use and assessments that incorporate opportunities for and evidence of student learning. We present the design, implementation, and reception of two authentic assessments, Science Portfolios and Teaching Presentations, designed for and implemented in an interdisciplinary science content course for preservice K-8 educators. Each assessment was designed to deepen student knowledge and incorporate relevance to students' future careers as teachers. These science assessments created authentic opportunities for, and served as evidence of, student learning. We offer our reflections about the implementation and discuss how these types of assessments could be used in other science classrooms.

AB  - Since contemporary learning theories, strategies and models offer the interdisciplinary approach, educators need new pedagogical alternative ways to attain it in practicum. For this reason, the current research aimed to illustrate how to intertwine mathematical modeling with an environmental issue that recruits waste management (e.g., reuse-recycle-reduce) to live an environmentally friendly lifestyle. Through a case study research, 6 seventh-grade students (3 females and 3 males; aged 13-14) voluntarily participated in the research. The researchers videotaped and analyzed all interactive learning processes to elicit the students' environmental dialogues. The results indicated that the interdisciplinary mathematical modeling afforded the students to acquire the targeted environmental concepts/issues and somewhat supported their arguments. Since the current research illustrates an alternative pedagogy to integrate science/environmental education into mathematics, it may be used to facilitate dissemination and applicability of the STEM education.

AB  - Context-based STEM learning has been proven to be useful as interdisciplinary storylines to regulate the flow and sequencing of lessons to obtain expected outcomes. This case study pilot project aims to contextualise scientific learning to local culture. Student groups sampled from two schools in distinct social backgrounds, reflected varied Indian population. Pre-service middle school science and social studies teachers conducted eight lessons as an interdisciplinary storyline with a few natural and social science concepts utilising an artefact representing the cultural history of India for seventh-graders. Data were collected through manually recording of students' responses and products made during class activities; researchers' observations and pre-service teachers' feedback about finding solutions to the difficulties faced. In order to address three research questions about socio-cultural context in science-curriculum design, student adoption of 3D learning, and overcoming teachers' challenges, a thematic analysis of data through the lens of five science practices and one crosscutting concept was performed. This study supported context-based STEM learning for the twenty-first century and strengthened cultural anchoring from an early stage implying the need for teacher professional development, curricular reform, and school infrastructure improvements to support policy implementation. Such researches may be extended to varied sociocultural contexts and discipline combinations to offer broader perspectives.

AB  - The faculty at Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences (MCPHS) recognized the potential benefits for collaborative teaching and learning across disciplines. Research and development of an Interprofessional Case Learning Project (ICLP) laid the foundation for the creation and implementation of a problem-based learning course. This course, Interdisciplinary Perspectives of an Infectious Disease--Malaria, introduced innovative interdisciplinary pedagogy into the curriculum of the MCPHS School of Arts & Sciences. Designed by biologists, chemists, historians, and public health faculty, this course introduced senior pre-medicine majors to varied methods and theories as they worked in groups to solve problems related to the incidence, prevention, and treatment of an infectious disease. Students' deliverables included journal-quality research papers and posters presented at the MCPHS School of Arts & Sciences Undergraduate Research Conference.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a science experimental guidebook for the mainstreamed students with learning disabilities and investigate its effect on their conceptual understanding of physical events. Through case study research methodology, the sample of the study consisted of 12 mainstreamed students with learning disabilities. To collect data, a conceptual understanding test, a drawing test, and interviews were used. The data were analyzed using four categories (sound understanding, partial understanding, alternative understanding, and no understanding). The results showed that the guidebook positively affected conceptual understanding of the mainstreamed students with learning disabilities. Even though the mainstreamed students with learning disabilities tended to comprehend related concepts through hands-on and minds-on activities/experiences, they still had some problems at transferring their gained knowledge to novel situations. Moreover, the results indicated that the mainstreamed students with learning disabilities were more successful in expressing their thoughts with drawings than the conceptual understanding test and interviews. The present study suggests that future studies should implement interdisciplinary approaches that intertwine special education with science education, mathematics education, and reading-writing practices.

AB  - Professional societies and institutes have stressed the importance of a dialogue between scientists and the public over the past decades. Especially the life sciences include many highly relevant research topics pertaining not only to scientific progress but also to decision-making in society. Surprisingly, few educational researchers and biological scientists make interdisciplinary efforts to communicate life science topics to society in an adequate manner. In our project, scientists from evolutionary biology, medicine and biology education worked in an interdisciplinary manner to design an educational program to make scientific research on antibiotic resistance and cystic fibrosis accessible to students (ninth, tenth and eleventh graders). In this article, we explain the communication objectives from the science education researcher's and the life scientist's perspectives. We provide a systematic description of the co-design process, a step-by-step procedure and the link to the open-source-materials used in the course. We conclude with a reflection about the implementation in consideration of the two perspectives. In sum, our results highlight that the co-design approach provides an effective method of communicating current biomedical research to school students. Our description of the co-design-process can help future applications of this co-design approach when designing science outreach activities.

AB  - As part of a larger study investigating the perceptions of university academics about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); STEM learning environments; and necessary capabilities for STEM educators at a university, this article reports a sample of academics' perceptions of STEM and its teaching and learning, as gleaned from their Draw a STEM Learning Environment (D-STEM) depictions and associated texts. The analysis of participants' perceptions of STEM--conducted both deductively, using research-informed understandings of STEM education, and inductively, through the identification of emerging ideas--indicated that most participants displayed quite limited understandings of STEM education, with few having an awareness of its power for enabling transdisciplinary learning. Both informed representations of STEM and evidence of STEM pedagogical competence were rare. The fact that engaging with the D-STEM instrument was perceived positively by many participants highlights its potential for inclusion in professional learning experiences for academics.

AB  - Adopting an explicit and reflective approach to the teaching of the history and philosophy of science is useful in promoting high school students' understanding of the nature of science. Whereas the history of science is usually signposted clearly in the school science curriculum, the philosophy of science is considered to be embedded in and integral to science education. This article argues that philosophical topics also need to be explicitly signposted and discussed in the teaching of the nature of science in high schools. This study investigates an interdisciplinary course on the nature of science in a Chinese senior high school. The course involved explicit teaching of philosophy of science topics with subject knowledge in each lesson. This mixed method design of the research included a modified version of the Views on Science, Technology and Society questionnaire as reported by Aikenhead and Ryan ("Science Education," 76(5):477-491, 1992) and phenomenographical analysis. Although the sample size is small, the results suggest that explicit teaching of philosophy of science topics helps students better understand both the nature of science and the relationship between science, technology and society.

AB  - In this paper, I argue that contemporary accounts of nature of science (NoS) are limited in their depiction of "science" and that new perspectives are needed to broaden their characterisation and appeal for science education. In particular, I refer to the role of interdisciplinary characterisations of science in informing the theory and practice of science teaching and learning. After a brief review on the reconceptualization of NoS from a range of perspectives, namely philosophy of science, socio-political accounts of science (in the context of colonial science), linguistics and anthropology, I will focus on philosophical and economical characterisation of science, drawing out some implications for science education. A predominant part of my argument will be theoretical in nature with some pedagogical applications in the context of an empirical project conducted in Istanbul, Turkey and co-funded by TUBITAK and Marie Curie Co-fund Brain Circulation Scheme. I will conclude with broader implications of interdisciplinary studies on science for science education research and practice.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research networks are increasing, with professionals encouraged to undertake research across disciplines to increase innovation, creativity and knowledge. More recently, this interdisciplinary focus is being mirrored by the establishment of interdisciplinary doctoral research networks. But do these networks work? And if so, how and why? We employ social capital theory to (a) understand the lived experiences of students in interdisciplinary doctoral programmes and (b) build programme design theory to support the development of social capital within such programmes. We present the results of 28 semi-structured interviews conducted with doctoral students from three European Union funded interdisciplinary research training networks to understand how they perceive the enhancers, inhibitors and manifestations of social capital within their networks. Key themes revolve around 'extracting value from the interdisciplinary process', 'motivating students throughout the interdisciplinary programme journey', and 'relating to others both within and external to the programme'. We propose a framework for interdisciplinary programme design.

AB  - Collaborative statisticians are instrumental to maintaining the rigor and reproducibility of multidisciplinary projects on which they collaborate. Clear, complete, well-annotated records of data, its revising, analysis, interpretation, and presentation are essential. Many students do not know how to systematically and consistently organize their digital files and cannot reliably replicate (or find!) work that may have been performed on a collaborative project. This article describes a newly developed and required one semester collaborative statistics course that includes the explicit teaching of project organization in lecture, emphasis of these skills on linked homework assignments, and their closely supervised practice through a mentored collaborative project with multidisciplinary researchers. The tripartite design provided exposure to project organization concepts during the course, encouraged straightforward implementation through homework assignments, and then challenged students with a real-world experience during a collaborative project. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

AB  - As distinct communities of practice (COP), science education research (SER) and environmental education research (EER) have both matured a great deal in recent decades, coming to include a greater diversity of theoretical perspectives, worldviews, and researcher and participant voices. In this paper, we present a view of theoretical inclusivity that promises a rich, robust research landscape for both EER and SER through the deliberate inclusion of non-Western theories. This view has several components: it requires researchers to be explicit and clear about their theoretical stances and to use critical reflection to evaluate their research; and it encourages the field to expansively explore phenomena and issues using multiple epistemologies and continue to deepen their focus on developing praxis. EER's interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary nature make it uniquely positioned to model such inclusivity and move forward together with SER to create knowledge that is more robust and more just. We identify and discuss three key imperatives for the two fields to embrace this theoretical inclusivity now and the paths forward to support scholars doing work in both EER and SER and for the productive future of these fields.

AB  - To build a sustainable future, science and engineering education programmes should emphasise scientific investigation, collaboration across traditional science topics and disciplines, and engineering design, including design and evaluation of solutions. While some research studies articulate the shifts that are needed to realise classroom learning emphasizing investigation and design, fewer research studies help us to understand how we co-design these instructional programmes, including how experts from different essential disciplines collaborate towards an interdisciplinary instructional programme. We adopted a qualitative case study design to address the research question, "What is the process of team co-construction of instructional materials that emphasize learning through both science investigation and engineering design?" The paper outlines the first year of our team co-construction activities involving the design, implementation, and evaluation of instructional materials for secondary science. Qualitative data included semi-structured interviews with nine team members and documentation in form of researcher field notes and learning artefacts. Two cycles of coding resulted in five major themes that served as the basis for the five-phase model of team co-construction of instructional materials. This study provides information on the kinds of partnerships and collaboration needed to realise instructional programmes for students' study of the interdisciplinary STEM-based challenges of tomorrow.

AB  - Background: This study explored the challenges around enacting change in a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subject at an Australian higher education institution and examined key elements required to ensure change. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to examine the barriers and levers driving change during the collaboration of discipline experts, in both science and education disciplines and professional staff across education and science faculties to change the delivery of an existing subject within a science faculty, from traditional lectures to an active learning approach. Sample: Participants from the education faculty and science faculty formed the participant interview pool of five academics for this study. Design and Methods: Research design of semi-structured interviews of participants was conducted to answer the research questions. Instruments were used to test the research questions, such as factors to facilitate and support change to teaching a science subject and the elements required for successful interdisciplinary collaboration for bringing about change to the teaching of a science subject. Thematic analyses were conducted on the data responses to answer the research questions. Results: The findings revealed that participants found that factors such as time, resources, understanding of and commitment to the proposed change represented potential barriers to change in the subject. The existence of multiple, time-sensitive champions, additional human resources and a collaborative network of participants, however, were identified as some of the key elements that supported enacting changes to a science subject. Conclusions: The findings of the study provide insights into interdisciplinary collaborations enacting changes to the teaching of a science subject. For instance, the need for establishment of a dynamic network of participants engendered with multiple interdisciplinary expertise, as well as the need for a change champion and implementation champion, throughout the curriculum redesign, planning and implementation phases of the change.

AB  - Recently, pedagogical approaches have focused on creating arts-integrated STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) or STEAM classes, which have drawn attention to the importance of the arts in science education. Despite increasing development and implementation of STEAM initiatives in science, there is limited discussion on the theoretical foundations, which could provide sound guidelines for science educators and teachers in planning and teaching STEAM curricula. In this paper, we set out the theoretical framework that explains and justifies integration of the arts and socio-cultural interaction into science teaching and learning. We explain in some detail the component theoretical elements and describe how these elements translate into teaching/learning practices in STEAM lessons. We conclude by re-emphasising the application of theoretical frameworks for the design of teaching/learning practices in an intercultural STEAM program.

AB  - Research shows that interdisciplinary learning approaches increase student knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. However, there is little empirical evidence about teacher enactment of interdisciplinary curricula, especially at the middle school level. In the Designing Biomimetic Robots (BioRobots) project, teachers received professional development and enacted an interdisciplinary robotics curriculum in middle school classrooms. The purpose of this study was to explore how a science and an engineering teacher enacted an interdisciplinary curriculum, designed to support teachers in both disciplines. We sought to understand the choices they made during curricular implementation and the ways in which they supported students' use of disciplinary practices. We conducted participant observations, collected teacher implementation logs, and interviewed teachers. Analysis was through deductive coding and analytic memos. Results indicate that both teachers' enactment aligned with the overarching curricular goals. However, as others have found, the specific material adaptations and enactment choices they made were all influenced by their disciplinary background, goals, and the school context. Careful design of this educative curriculum supported the teachers to teach disciplinary content and practices outside their area of expertise. One implication for the design of educative curriculum is to make explicit the commonalities across the disciplines.

AB  - The research orientation of the Department of technics, Faculty of Education, University of Hradec Kralove focuses on finding new ways for development of polytechnic and science education. The research is motivated by the fact that children's interest in technical and science subjects is decreasing in recent years in the Czech Republic. The research aims are to prove the applicability and effectiveness of multidisciplinary methods in teaching of technical and science subjects. The research observed the effect of the use of construction activity in teaching of physics in lower secondary school. The results of research confirmed that working and construction activity can develop technical and science thinking of children. [For the full proceedings, see ED619611.]

AB  - Out-of-field teaching is a global educational challenge. In particular, many teachers whose academic background and main teaching experience is in biology are called to teach middle school physics and have limited opportunities for productive professional development. Based on previous studies, we expect these teachers to hold different epistemic cognitions from the in-field teachers. The present study builds on this epistemic diversity and offers dialogic argumentation as a means to promote mutual learning among physics teachers from different disciplinary backgrounds. We describe guidelines for designing "interdisciplinary dialogic argumentation" activities that aim to encourage teachers to express their disciplinary perspectives in the context of inquiry-based physics and to facilitate a deliberative discourse among them. We demonstrate in a case study the ways in which the discourse of a group of in-field and out-of-field teachers unfolds under the proposed design guidelines. Using the Actor-Network methodology and an analysis of power relations, we uncover a complex interplay between the social and the epistemic in the discourse: when interactions become more dialogic and power relations more equalized, the out-of-field teachers take an active role in the discussion, foregrounding their epistemic practices and enhancing the epistemic practices of the group, including the in-field teacher.

AB  - In this chapter, eight foci relevant for science educators are presented and illustrated by paradigmatic examples and discussed in two parts. The first part "from science education to practice and authorities" discusses the four foci of: (1) developing concepts for instruction; (2) responding to the needs of schools; (3) connecting researchers, teachers, and stakeholders; and (4) implementing research results into practice. The second part "from practice and authorities to science education" includes a further four foci: (5) reframing recent scientific research as science content for schools; (6) considering non-formal teaching-learning processes; (7) helping to create curricular and structural changes; and (8) being aware of his/her own responsibilities. The paradigmatic examples discussed are from recent research projects in science education, for example, the development of new instruments for formative and summative assessment, the comparison of different test formats like multiple-choice problems and concept map problems, the implementation of a new interdisciplinary curricula, the development of a so-called MobiLab, and the collaboration with scientists and entrepreneurs in nanoscience. It is discussed why the foci and examples are important to researchers and educators and which lessons can be learnt.

AB  - Despite longstanding calls to integrate school science and mathematics, concerns remain about how to achieve high-quality learning in both subjects. In reporting on a teaching approach that aimed to achieve this outcome, the authors focus particularly on the teacher's role. The Interdisciplinary Mathematics and Science project (IMS), an Australian Research Council study, aimed to integrate learning in both subjects through investigative inquiry processes. Teachers guide students to construct, evaluate, and refine multimodal representations in a four-stage teaching model. This article describes the key design principles of this interdisciplinary approach and the focus of the inquiry process. The authors outline the teaching model's stages as a basis for illustrating how teachers have enacted these stages across different topics.

AB  - How, when and what kind of learning takes place are key questions in all educational environments. School graduates are expected to have reached a development level whereby they have, among many fundamental skills, the ability to think critically, to plan their studies and their future, and to integrate knowledge across disciplines. However, it is challenging to develop these skills in schools. Following existing curricula, disciplines are often taught separately and by different teachers, making it difficult for students to connect knowledge studied and learned from one discipline to that of another discipline. The Next Generation Science Standards on teaching and learning natural science in the United States point out important crosscutting concepts in science education (NGSS, 2013). In Estonia, similar trends are leading to an emphasis on the need to further develop scientific literacy skills and interdisciplinary learning in students. The changing environment around us must be reflected in changes in our school system. In this paper, we report on research that intends to answer the questions: (a) "How much do Estonian students develop an interdisciplinary understanding of science throughout their high school education?", and (b) "Is their thinking more interdisciplinary after two years of studies in an Estonian high school?" Additionally, we analyzed the results based on the type of school the students attended, and we examined the use concept mapping to assess interdisciplinary learning. This research is part of an overall study that involved students from 44 Estonian high schools taking a science test similar to the three-dimensional Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) test (hereafter called PISA-like multidimensional test) as well as constructing concept maps, while in 10th and 12th grade. In this paper, we report on the analysis of the results for 182 of the students, concentrating on the analysis of the concept maps they constructed. The results suggest that there were changes in the students' interdisciplinary knowledge, but these were small and varied depending on the students' school type. They also suggest that changes may be needed in the Estonian educational system to increase the students' level of interdisciplinary understanding of science.

AB  - Students often experience difficulty in connecting knowledge from different college courses to solve complex problems such as ocean acidification, a pressing concern within the ongoing climate crisis. Here, we introduce a multidisciplinary activity in which students use their chemistry knowledge of change and stability in chemical systems through Le Chatelier's principle and equilibrium of coupled reactions to explain the biological phenomenon of how changes in CO[subscript 2] concentrations can impact shelled organisms and ecosystems more broadly in the ocean. In this activity, we build on prior literature and emphasize Three-Dimensional Learning (3DL) to support students in developing a deeper understanding of this complex problem. This Ocean Acidification activity asks students to explain (1) the relationship between CO[subscript 2] concentration and ocean pH and (2) how and why changes in ocean pH could weaken shelled organisms. Among 136 students in a second-semester general chemistry course at a large institution, 93% were able to correctly predict the relationship between CO[subscript 2] and pH (chemistry-biology connection). Additionally, 43% of the students were able to then further apply this knowledge correctly to explain an unfamiliar situation in which the decreased pH could lead to less available carbonate ion for the shells (biological phenomenon). This result highlights that while some students were able to correctly explain the biological phenomenon and make meaningful connections, others would require additional in-class scaffolding and student-instructor interaction to be able to integrate their knowledge to explain this unfamiliar complex biological phenomenon. Implications for teaching and future implementations are also discussed.

AB  - Interdisciplinary collaborations to help students compose for discipline-specific contexts draw on multiple expertise. Science, technology, education, and mathematics (STEM) programs particularly rely on their writing colleagues because (1) their academic expertise is often not writing and (2) teaching writing often necessitates a redesigning of existing instructional materials. While many writing studies scholars have the expertise to assist their STEM colleagues with such tasks, how to do so--and, more fundamentally, how to begin such efforts--is not commonly focused on in the literature stemming from these collaborations. Our article addresses this gap by detailing an interdisciplinary Writing in the Disciplines (WID) collaboration at a large, public R1 university between STEM and writing experts to redesign the university's introductory biology writing curriculum. The collaborative curriculum design process detailed here is presented through the lens of wayfinding, which concerns orientation, trailblazing, and moving through uncertain landscapes according to cues. Within this account, a critical focus on language--what we talk about when we talk about writing--emerges, driving both the collaboration itself and resultant curricular revisions. Our work reveals how collaborators can wayfind through interdisciplinary partnerships and writing curriculum development by transforming differences in discipline-specific expertise into a new path forward.

AB  - The article is devoted to the issues of teaching mobile application development and, as a consequence, training of highly qualified in-demand mobile developers. Nowadays, training professional mobile developers is a crucial task all over the world. The researchers emphasize the complexity of mobile application development associated with its multidisciplinarity, the mobile device hardware limitations, the necessity of object-oriented programming in the mobile development. Due to the complexity of the mobile development field and the gap in programming knowledge of first-year students, there are fears that prepare highly qualified mobile developers during undergraduate education is impossible. In this regard, the article proposes a spiral model teaching mobile application development with the aim of effective training of mobile developers. The spiral model covers all levels of teaching programming from high school to higher education with aim to develop knowledge from introductory programming to mobile application development. The offered spiral model suggests the continuity in the content and overcoming the gap in programming knowledge between high school and higher education. Such a model is the most appropriate for the training of highly qualified mobile developers in the context of Kazakhstan's education system.

AB  - Despite historical national efforts to improve elementary science education, science instruction continues to be marginalized, varying by state. This study was designed to address the ongoing challenge of educating elementary preservice teachers (PSTs) to teach science. Elementary PSTs are one of the science education community's major links to schools and science education reform. However, they often lack a strong background in science, knowledge of effective science teaching strategies, and consequently have low confidence and self-efficacy. This investigation explored the initial learning of elementary PSTs using an interdisciplinary model of a scientific classroom discourse community during a science methods course. Findings post-methods course suggested that the PSTs gained confidence in how to teach inquiry-based elementary science and recognized inquiry-based science as an effective means for engaging student learning. Additionally, PSTs embraced the interdisciplinary model as one that benefits students' learning and effectively uses limited time in a school day.

AB  - Students' argumentation skills are considered a central tool to contribute to scientific controversies in the science classroom. Scientific controversies of social relevance (socioscientific issues; SSI) are subject to multiple viewpoints that are often rooted in diverse disciplines. However, the relationship between issue familiarity and students' multidisciplinary argumentation is still a matter under discussion. This study: (1) explores whether the selection of a particular issue (animal testing) enables students' engagement in multidisciplinary argumentation without additional issue familiarisation, i.e., using only their existing knowledge; and (2) clarifies the relationship between increased issue familiarity and students' multidisciplinary argumentation. One hundred and sixty three ninth and tenth graders participated in this study, of whom one hundred and six took part in a teaching unit to familiarise themselves with the issue of animal testing. The study's results demonstrate that animal testing constitutes an effective issue to engage students with the complexity of SSI without requiring more than basic familiarity prior to engagement. The results further demonstrate that increased issue familiarity can enhance the overall diversity of discipline-related arguments amongst students; however, not all disciplines were enhanced equally. The findings suggest that more instructional guidance seems to be needed to assist students in broadening their arguments.

AB  - An interdisciplinary climate change project aligned with Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) was developed and implemented in an undergraduate chemistry course for K-8 preservice science teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Three demonstration activities aligned with NGSS and the Framework for K-12 Science Education are included in this project, which can be adopted and implemented in science classes in primary/middle schools. This project demonstrated to students how to align the activities with NGSS and the three-dimensional framework, as well as how to select phenomena on the basis of local relevant context and using the 5E instructional model in the teaching of the project. The preservice science teachers also learned chemistry concepts related to climate change through the project. Moreover, this project provides the opportunity for instructors to introduce the teaching of NGSS-based science activities to preservice science teachers using phenomena-based learning and a 5E instructional model.

AB  - Twenty-first-century biology is inherently interdisciplinary. Every aspect of biology, from molecules to organisms to ecosystems, is richly informed by the physical, mathematical, and computational sciences. It is both an exciting and daunting time for biology educators--exciting because of the vast opportunity for important new discoveries that will come about in an interdisciplinary context, yet daunting for many current biology educators who were not trained within such a framework. The call for transformation of the undergraduate biology experience to better address interdisciplinarity is not new. At St. Olaf College, a liberal arts college with an undergraduate-only population of [approximately] 3000, school administrators are fortunate in that their relatively small size allows for a certain degree of nimbleness as they consider changes that foster interdisciplinarity. In this essay, the authors share some perspectives and examples that have emerged for them over the past 10 years or so as they have attempted to offer a broadly interdisciplinary environment in which their students and faculty explore and understand biology.

AB  - Elementary teacher preparation programs often separate content and technology courses. This study examined the impact of changing the required science content courses for elementary preservice teachers in a small liberal arts setting. Following the new science course, students participated in a field experience as part of an elementary science pedagogy course that required using technology when delivering content lessons. We compared the students' perceived technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) and confidence teaching with the technology between the two groups. Data was collected using the TPACK survey at the end of their teacher preparation program. The analysis showed a significant difference in students' perceived TPACK between a discipline-specific science course and a multidisciplinary course, except in one dimension, pedagogical knowledge (PK). Overall, candidate confidence in combining content and technology in teaching a classroom lesson was higher with the multidisciplinary course. However, students could not effectively describe specific episodes that indicate high-level, inquiry-based teaching but did describe overall knowledge of technological pedagogical knowledge.

AB  - This study on the Estonian lower secondary (7-9th grade) science curricula, is seen as an important framework for educators preparing students as tomorrow's citizens able to reflect on sustainable energy development. As the curriculum is taken to be the major document allowing insights into Estonian educational standards, this study identifies components within the intended lower secondary science curricula for subjects of biology, chemistry, earth science, physics, and interdisciplinary science. Using document analysis, verbs associated with career-related learning outcomes are detected, allowing the relatedness of the energy conceptualizations and determination of their cognitive level utilizing SOLO (Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes) taxonomy. A team of coders identify a total of 782 learning outcomes across three learning domains: psychomotor (176), affective (32), cognitive (574) at unistructural (33), multistructural (225), relational (276), and extended abstract (40) levels. The majority of energy concept learning outcomes (274) are identified in the source (form) and transfer (transform) categories. Very few career-related learning outcomes are detected with the science education relevance dimensions (individual, societal, career). The suitability of the findings is discussed. The current analyzing method can be applied to other educational disciplines for raising awareness of disciplinary crosscutting concepts.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this article is to give a bird's eye view of the main issues surrounding the teaching of economic and social sciences in the French high school Approach: This article is based above all on a synthesis of the existing primary and secondary literature on Economic and social sciences ("sciences économiques et sociales") teaching in France and the controversies surrounding it. Findings: This text gives a general overview of the situation of SES teaching in France, by going back to the original intentions of its authors; by analysing curricular developments, which show a progressive distance from them; and finally by highlighting the main collective actors involved (SES teachers and other neighbouring disciplines, national education hierarchy, academics, political actors, employer lobbies, etc.). Practical implications: Beyond the French situation it presents, this article raises a number of more general questions about the objectives that can be assigned to social science teaching in high schools, the opportunity to mix several academic disciplines and the pedagogical methods that can be implemented.

AB  - Creativity, giftedness, and leadership are complex, important phenomena, especially in the threatening turbulence of 21st-century conditions; consequently, there is an increasing need to understand how to strengthen them. We can learn much about these phenomena from within the borders of specialized disciplines; however, they are too complex and multifaceted to fit within the walls of disciplinary silos. Interdisciplinary explorations can reveal theories and research findings that expand our knowledge bases about creativity, giftedness, and leadership. This analysis includes the rationale for engaging in interdisciplinary investigations for these purposes. It includes examples of the ways in which interdisciplinary thinking invigorates creativity and cognitive diversity; illuminates the benefits of visual--spatial gifts that strengthen the development of important talents in gifted students who can go on to become creative leaders; and shows how human rights can be strengthened by constraining economic and political corruption. It also describes the benefits of using interdisciplinary navigation through different levels of analysis, each of which includes a number of academic disciplines.

AB  - This paper draws together two important agendas in science education. The first is making science education more inclusive such that students from non-Western or indigenous cultures can benefit from culturally relevant curricula. The second is integrating technology into the curriculum under the umbrella of Science-Technology-Society (STS) education to embrace the social aspects of science, with technology serving as a bridge. The advancement of the first agenda is hindered by the pursuance by both Western and non-Western societies of narrow cultural and practical goals without considering the development of science and technology from a cross-cultural perspective. The second agenda is limited by the misconception that technology is applied science, leading to the exclusion from STS discussions of pre-science or indigenous technologies developed by non-Western cultures. Through selected case studies of the evolution of Chinese traditional technologies and their interaction with science, this paper offers a perspective from the Far East, and argues for situating culturally responsive science education in broader historical and cross-cultural contexts to acknowledge the multi-cultural contributions to science and technology. A form of cross-cultural STS education is advanced, encompassing the cultural basis of technological developments, technology diffusion, interactions of traditional technology with science, and the potential development of traditional or indigenous technologies. This approach provides a bridge between the existing universal science education paradigm promoted in the West and the different forms of multi-cultural education advocated by indigenous science educators. To translate theory into practice, a conceptual framework is proposed in which the essential transdisciplinary knowledge base, curricular goals, and pedagogical approaches are embedded.

AB  - While it has been recognized that science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education requires an interdisciplinary approach, integrating multiple subjects in a meaningful way remains challenging for teachers. This study aimed to design a STEM curriculum, emphasizing explicit and continuous scaffolding of students' reflection on scientific and engineering knowledge. The primary goal was to foster knowledge integration in their engineering designs and enhance their attitudes toward STEM. The study involved fifty tenth-grade students who were guided to discuss and reflect on relevant scientific and engineering knowledge and to apply mathematics for data collection and analysis during the design of their technology products. The research instruments included an assessment of the progression of knowledge integration in students' engineering designs through student journals and pre- and post-test surveys on attitudes toward science, technology, engineering, and the learning environment. The results reveal that the introduction and explicit scaffolding students' reflection on scientific and engineering knowledge led to a gradual improvement in knowledge integration within their engineering designs. Students also significantly enhanced their attitudes toward STEM and the learning environment compared to the general school curriculum. This study contributes to interdisciplinary learning that promotes the integration of scientific and engineering knowledge in students' engineering design processes, and to interdisciplinary assessment that evaluates students' knowledge integration across learning progressions and outcomes.

AB  - Interdisciplinary STEM education is a particular pedagogical methodology in which learners learn the association and connection of the knowledge of science and mathematics through particular technological engineering. To achieve this, specific interdisciplinary STEM-based educational curricula should be developed, and teachers should be qualified appropriately before any implementation process. Therefore, the aims of the research are both to (a) reveal the effect of the STEM workshop on science teachers' awareness of the relationship between science and other disciplines and to (b) examine its transferring contribution to their lesson planning approach. The case study method was used to get the essential data of research with 40 science teachers. The data were gathered via the Questionnaire for Interdisciplinary Association of Science, the lesson plans, and semi-structured interviews. As a result of the research, less variation is found in disciplines associated with science such as mathematics, technology-design, social studies, engineering, visual arts, Turkish languages, and music, etc. compared to data tools that they applied before and after workshop sessions. Besides, the post-applied data tool results revealed that the participants provided more comprehensive explanations regarding the direction of the interdisciplinary association, which suggests a better understanding of the relationship of science with other disciplines in the latter case. In addition, it was determined that most of the teachers designed their lesson plans based on an interdisciplinary approach and used the Engineering Design Process (EDP) as a teaching method to create the learning environment.

AB  - Teamwork and collaboration are twenty-first century skills valued by STEM employers for addressing the most urgent problems in society. To prepare undergraduate STEM students, they must graduate valuing teamwork and collaboration. The Integrated Concentration in STEM (iCons) program aims to meet this goal by utilizing interdisciplinary team-based learning to address complex real-world problems. In doing so, the program provides students with a learning experience that demonstrates the authentic value of teamwork and shows how collaboration can be useful for solving problems. The purpose of this study was to examine whether students who participated in iCons developed more positive values related to teamwork and collaboration than similar students who did not participate in the program. Framed by Expectancy Value Theory (EVT)--specifically the concept of utility value, which is how practically useful students find teams in helping them fulfill their objectives or to solve problems--we investigated the iCons program with a mixed methods design that analyzed survey and interview data from students. Overall, iCons had a positive effect on students' perceptions of the utility value of teamwork and collaboration. Qualitative results helped to explain these findings in more depth, including students' positive perceptions of the interdisciplinary design of the program. Findings suggest that more resources should be put into creating and expanding opportunities in STEM that utilize a combination of pedagogical strategies focused on team-based learning and an interdisciplinary design. Further research is needed to understand these effects in more detail.

AB  - This article reports on the efforts of a political science professor teaching a multidisciplinary course focused on New York City to develop an interdisciplinary class project designed to lead students to an appreciation of the immigrant experience in the United States "From Ellis Island to JFK" (Foner, 2000). The particular interdisciplinary project that the article describes employs work from philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and political science in an effort to help students grasp more fully the often contentious and always complex process of immigrant acculturation from traditional cultures to life in a modern capitalist society. The project culminates with students considering how the narrative in Mario Puzo's novel "The Fortunate Pilgrim," which chronicles the fortunes of an early 20th century Italian immigrant family in New York, reflects the academic work covered previously in class and whether the story line applies more generally to the experiences of recent immigrants to the United States. It is notable that the venue within which this class occurs, St. John's University, has had as part of its larger mission for nearly 150 years the education of first-generation college students. This mission is a particularly telling one in a classroom peopled with first-generation Muslim immigrants as well as fifth or sixth generation descendants of the southern and eastern European immigrants of the turn of the last century.

AB  - The aim of this research is to explore the research trends of inquiry-based science (IBS) articles in the Web of Science database during 2000-2021. The bibliometric method was used in the research. A total of 662 IBS education articles were included in the study, out of 1389 IBS publications covering all fields published in Web of Science during 2000-2021. Citation and co-citation analysis were applied using VOSviewer software. The data obtained from this analysis are presented with tables, graphs, and bibliometric maps. According to the results, there is an increase in the number of IBS publications or citations in the recent years. The most cited keywords are teacher development, professional development, primary school, science achievement, and PISA. The most cited countries are the USA, Germany, and France. It has recently been determined that there is a trend towards sustainability education, local perspectives, technology, and interdisciplinary integration in IBS studies. The results were discussed with previous studies in the literature and some suggestions were made for future research. This research, which photographs inquired-based science studies published over the last two decades, may be useful to science education experts and curriculum evaluators.

AB  - Students are encouraged to develop a set of scientific skills and disciplinary practices common across the STEM disciplines. These skills (scientific inquiry, quantitative skills, laboratory and computational skills, communication skills, teamwork/interpersonal skills, interdisciplinary competency) are highlighted as important in discipline-based guiding documents -- biology (Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action), chemistry (American Chemical Society Guidelines and Evaluation Procedures for Bachelor's Degree Programs), and mathematics (A Common Vision for Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences Programs in 2025) -- for undergraduate teaching of biology, chemistry, and mathematics, and for the professional success of STEM college graduates. To promote interdisciplinary teaching and learning of STEM, we present a comprehensive comparison of the different disciplines' competency statements for undergraduate education. This organization and comparison of commonalities in scientific skills and disciplinary practices can be used by faculty and departments to come together to break down traditional silos, help their students more easily apply learning from one STEM discipline to another, and to create institutional change.

AB  - A crucial skill for researchers in inter- and transdisciplinary environmental projects is the ability to be reflexive about knowledge and knowledge production. Few studies exist on the operationalization of reflexive skills and teaching and learning strategies that help students master these skills. This research aims to contribute in this direction. We distinguished two components of reflexive skills: (i) assessing the relative contributions of scientific disciplines and non-academic knowledge in addressing environmental issues; (ii) assessing the role of norms and values in research. We developed a framework for teaching and learning reflexive skills and evaluated this framework within a quasi-experimental educational setting involving 3 groups of 30 students. Students' reflexive skills were assessed quantitatively using a pre- and post-test questionnaire. Moreover, students' reflection papers were analysed to get a better understanding of their perspectives on the teaching and learning framework. We show that it is possible to train students in reflexive skills, but it requires a well-designed learning setting.

AB  - While it is essential for life science students to be trained in modern techniques and approaches, rapidly developing, interdisciplinary fields such as bioinformatics present distinct challenges to undergraduate educators. In particular, many educators lack training in new fields, and high-quality teaching and learning materials may be sparse. To address this challenge with respect to bioinformatics, the Network for the Integration of Bioinformatics into Life Science Education (NIBLSE), in partnership with Quantitative Undergraduate Biology Education and Synthesis (QUBES), developed incubators, a novel collaborative process for the development of open educational resources (OER). Incubators are short-term, online communities that refine unpublished teaching lessons into more polished and widely usable learning resources. The resulting products are published and made freely available in the NIBLSE Resource Collection, providing recognition of scholarly work by incubator participants. In addition to producing accessible, high-quality resources, incubators also provide opportunities for faculty development. Because participants are intentionally chosen to represent a range of expertise in bioinformatics and pedagogy, incubators also build professional connections among educators with diverse backgrounds and perspectives and promote the discussion of practical issues involved in deploying a resource in the classroom. Here we describe the incubator process and provide examples of beneficial outcomes. Our experience indicates that incubators are a low cost, short-term, flexible method for the development of OERs and professional community that could be adapted to a variety of disciplinary and pedagogical contexts.

AB  - A desired outcome of education reform efforts is for undergraduates to effectively integrate knowledge across disciplines in order to evaluate and address real-world issues. Yet there are few assessments designed to measure if and how students think interdisciplinarily. Here, a sample of science faculty were surveyed to understand how they currently assess students' interdisciplinary science understanding. Results indicate that individual writing-intensive activities are the most frequently used assessment type (69%). To understand how writing assignments can accurately assess students' ability to think interdisciplinarily, we used a preexisting rubric, designed to measure social science students' interdisciplinary understanding, to assess writing assignments from 71 undergraduate science students. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 25 of those students to explore similarities and differences between assignment scores and verbal understanding of interdisciplinary science. Results suggest that certain constructs of the instrument did not fully capture this competency for our population, but instead, an interdisciplinary framework may be a better model to guide assessment development of interdisciplinary science. These data suggest that a new instrument designed through the lens of this model could more accurately characterize interdisciplinary science understanding for undergraduate students.

AB  - This study examines the efficacy of a novel college sustainability course in promoting relevant environmental knowledge and interest in careers related to environmental aspects within the Taiwanese educational context. The core content of the course covers the essential concepts of sustainability and introduces students to environmental issues and their interrelation with the nexus of food, energy, and water, as well as related economic and social issues. This action competencefocused course was designed to allow students to develop their understanding of sustainability through a combination of engaging lectures, novel group activities, case studies, exercises, and team projects. The sample consisted of 44 Taiwanese undergraduate and graduate students majoring in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Participants' interest in STEM careers and perceived knowledge were measured by a pre-test and post-test administered before and after the program, respectively. Analyses of variance, correlation analyses, and cross-lagged panel regression analyses were conducted to test four hypotheses. Results of repeated-measure analysis of covariance indicated that knowledge increased significantly from pre-test to post-test, but not career interest. Results of a cross-lagged panel regression analysis also indicated that pre-test knowledge was a significant positive predictor of post-test career interest. By creating an engaging class atmosphere and promoting experiential self-learning activities, this course was highly effective in enhancing students' knowledge of key sustainability aspects. Implications for interest development theory and sustainability pedagogy are also discussed.

AB  - Problem-solving has been one of the major strands in science education research. But much of the problem-solving research has been conducted on discipline-based contexts; little research has been done on how students, especially individuals, solve interdisciplinary problems. To understand how individuals reason about interdisciplinary problems, we conducted an interview study with 16 graduate students coming from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. During the interviews, we asked participants to solve two interdisciplinary science problems on the topic of osmosis. We investigated participants' problem reasoning processes and probed in their attitudes toward general interdisciplinary approach and specific interdisciplinary problems. Through a careful inductive content analysis of their responses, we studied how disciplinary, cognitive, and affective factors influenced their interdisciplinary problems-solving. We found that participants' prior discipline-based science learning experiences had both positive and negative influences on their interdisciplinary problem-solving. These influences were embodied in their conceptualization of the interdisciplinary problems, the strategies they used to integrate different disciplinary knowledge, and the attitudes they had toward interdisciplinary approach in general and specific interdisciplinary problems. This study sheds light on interdisciplinary science education by revealing the complex relationship between disciplinary learning and interdisciplinary problem-solving.

AB  - Although existing data science educational programmes develop talent and produce graduates, business-focused data science curricula comprising essential skills oriented to business and managerial data with associated analysis, remain underserved. Current pedagogy has focused either on data science or on purely analytic technical aspects. There is therefore, an opportunity to rethink how institutions can develop innovative data-focussed education programmes, addressing both modern industry and community demands. As both academia and industry strive to integrate applied learning, transferable and enterprise skills into business and sciences, this paper proposes a design based research approach (DBR) for designing such a new interdisciplinary data science teaching curriculum as a foundation to deliver business undergraduate degrees in Business Data Science. Adopting a design science method our proposed DBR illustrates effective utilities for conceptualising and evaluating a fully functional new degree programme -- Bachelor of Business Data Science. Ten senior business information systems academics and five analytics industry practitioners in Victoria, Australia were interviewed in three iterative prototyping phases followed by a final focus group session with business information systems students that evaluated the proposed structure. The findings suggest that proposed DBR ensures the design of an innovative data science degree that may meet growing industry and interdisciplinary demands. The paper concludes by discussing overall feasibility of the proposal in the Australian higher education sector, particularly for the case context of an Australian University.

AB  - Strong communication skills, in varied professional settings, have become an absolute necessity for young professionals. Therefore, university educators are challenged to provide novice specialists with the effective foreign language training that could bring the real professional world into the classroom. This study suggests an innovative method for teaching communication skills to students, through the use of real-life scenarios, drawn from the professional context. The core objective of the research was to define whether the scenario-based instruction could effectively enhance the development of professional communication skills of students in the context of university foreign language training. The data were collected through active observation and critical incidents technique, analyzed and summarized by means of descriptive statistics. The results of the study indicate the efficacy of scenario-based communication training in higher education. However, scenario-based instruction requires careful assessment of learners' needs and expectations, thoughtful selection and design of teaching materials, and the development of an active learning environment.

AB  - Understanding the nature of science (NOS) has emerged as a core curricular goal since at least the 1960s. While science education reforms around the world have shed light on various epistemic and social underpinnings of science, how science curriculum documents portray the nature of other related disciplines such as mathematics and engineering has drawn little attention. Such lack of attention is surprising, given the growing interest among educators in the integrated approach to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and the frequent emphasis on STEM in recent curriculum policy. The study reported in this paper aimed to understand how recent science education reform documents from the USA, Korea and Taiwan compare with regard to their representation of the nature of STEM disciplines. Using the framework of the family resemblance approach (FRA), we present a comparative analysis of three recent science education standards documents to examine their coverage of the epistemic underpinnings of STEM disciplines, particularly with regard to the disciplinary aims, values and practices. The results indicate that the features specific to science and shared by science and engineering were most frequently addressed in the standards documents, whereas mathematics-related features were rarely mentioned. Furthermore, there was variation in the coverage in terms of the nature of STEM disciplines. Based on the findings, we discuss the contributions of the FRA framework in analysing STEM curricula in an interdisciplinary manner and make suggestions for integrating the nature of STEM disciplines in science curriculum documents.

AB  - Contribution: Prior studies on pedagogical methodologies to acquire soft skills have shown that developing collaborative tasks produces positive impact in students' abilities. In this article, a pedagogical approach based on interdisciplinary practice and realistic problems is proposed to improve students' teamwork skills. Background: Traditionally, soft skill acquisition has received scarce attention in high education curricula. Consequently, students finish their studies without having developed important competencies, such as communication, conflict resolution and teamwork skills. Intended Outcomes: Students who follow a realistic interdisciplinary approach improve both their soft and hard skills compared to students who follow a traditional collaborative pedagogical methodology. Through the approach proposed, students progress in completing tasks, participating in the team, collaborating in the organization, accepting agreements and taking into account the others' points of view. Application Design: The experience involved students from two different disciplines, prospective computer science engineers and preservice teachers. They worked together to design an educational application that required prospective engineers to apply Human-Computer Interaction fundamentals. A quasi-experimental study was performed using either knowledge tests or self-assessment pre-post-tests, both subsequently analyzed using quantitative methods. Findings: 1) The prospective CS engineers who followed the interdisciplinary realistic practice approach achieved better learning outcomes than those who did not; 2) the educational context affects teamwork skill development; and 3) students improved their ability to work and participate in the team after the experience.

AB  - As newcomers in the field of science education research we discuss our perspectives on critical scholarship in the academy. Using the metalogue approach we explore our perceptions of science education, our experiences of the barriers to critical science education research, our analyses of why these barriers exist, and imaginings about how these barriers could be removed. In this paper, metalogue provides us with a way to retain our individual voices, thoughts and ideas, yet challenge our pre-conceived notions about finding a critical space in science education. Through an interaction with each other's thoughts and past experiences we outline some aspects of the field of science education as we see it; for example, we discuss why the field may be seen as rigid as well as the contexts that surround possibilities for interdisciplinary, critical, social justice research. We conclude that a larger, multi-vocal discussion is necessary to locate the possibilities for critical, social justice oriented science education.

AB  - The development of communication and other soft skills among computer science students is not usually an easy task. Often, curricula focus on technical skills, with team projects being used for the improvement of communication skills. However, these teams usually comprise solely of computer science students. In this paper, we present a didactical methodology, called MIMI, which can be used in a short, intensive, programme for undergraduate students. This methodology has been implemented in real projects that have run annually since 2014. We advocate the use of team-based projects, with an important requirement that each team is both multidisciplinary and multinational. Additionally, the period of teamwork is short and intensive. A significant role in the project is given to team mentors. A mentor is a person, usually a university lecturer, who helps the team organize their work and tracks if the team's planned didactical results are being achieved. The program has proved to stimulate an increase of soft skills among the students who participated and, in particular, among the computer science students. The detailed description of our process will allow others to implement and build similar events in their university or company environments, the focus of which is a Multinational, Intercultural, Multidisciplinary & Intensive (MIMI) methodology approach.

AB  - Background: Argumentation, the justification of claims with reasons and/or evidence, has emerged as a significant goal in science education in recent years. Yet, there is limited understanding of secondary students' arguments and particularly their use of warrants in interdisciplinary contexts such as science and religious education. Furthermore, research on argumentation in science education has not paid sufficient attention to how students' arguments may potentially reflect intellectual humility. The concept of intellectual humility reinforces the view that one is not excessively arrogant regarding their beliefs, or excessively dismissive of their or others' beliefs Purpose: It is important to understand students' engagement in argumentation particularly in the context of topics such as evolution and creationism that often present tension and conflict. For classroom argumentation activities to be fruitful, students' understanding of warrants as well as their intellectual humility are prerequisite. Sample: The data are drawn from Year 9 students' engagement in a card sort activity in the context of a funded project in England. The activity engaged the students in a task on the origins of life, where evidence and reasons were related to evolution versus creationism. Design and Methods: The card sort activity was designed to limit students' contributions about different evidence and emphasise specifically, the link (warrant) by providing fixed evidence and claims. During the activity, students were presented with 'evidence cards'. Students were asked to consider each card and place it under the claim that they felt the card supported even if the student did not support that claim personally. They were further asked to explain why they thought the evidence might be used to support that claim. Students' verbal accounts of their warrants for placing cards were explored. Conclusion: Students' warrants included repetition of evidence statements without articulating the reasons. As intellectual humility concerns accurately tracking the positive epistemic status of a belief or argument, a lack of coherence within students' arguments contradicts the embodiment of intellectual humility.

AB  - In 2010, Nolan and Temple Lang proposed "integration of computing concepts into statistics curricula at all levels." The unprecedented growth in data and emphasis on data science has provided an impetus to finally realizing full implementations of this in new statistics and data science programs and courses. We discuss a proposal for the stealth development of computational skills in students' exposure to introductory data science through careful, scaffolded exposure to computation and its power. Our intent is to support students, regardless of interest and self-efficacy in coding, in becoming data-driven learners, who are capable of asking complex questions about the world around them, and then answering those questions through the use of data-driven inquiry. Reference is made to the computer science and statistics consensus curriculum frameworks the International Data Science in Schools Project (IDSSP) recently published for secondary school data science or introductory tertiary programs, designed to optimize data-science accessibility.

AB  - The aim of this research is to investigate the aspects of science education, which are pedagogically desirable for the individual in the society of 21st century. The research was conducted by Curricular Delphi Study method in three rounds with international comparisons. In the first round, an open-ended survey was used, and in the next two rounds the instrument was structured to answer the refined research questions of the study, such as the priorities and practices towards the inquiry-based science education. The paper reports on the findings of a survey collected from 125 stakeholders of science education, including scientists, science educators, and education administrators from Turkey. In the results of the differentiated analyses according to the sample groups, all stakeholders emphasize the role of science education in the survival of a country. They all put a great emphasis on the curriculum. The stakeholders emphasized the significance of engagement with the interdisciplinary relations of the sciences, their findings and their perspectives with regard to their role in enhancing individual intellectual personality development. It is suggested that scientific inquiry includes the ability to consolidate the inquiry processes with scientific knowledge, scientific reasoning and critical thinking to advance scientific knowledge.

AB  - Religious matters have traditionally been considered as a sensitive subject in French state schools. Since 1989 and the first 'Muslim headscarf affair', faith-related conflicts in those institutions have been the subject of a relatively opaque counting policy. Mobilising several state institutions- which alternatively cooperate or compete- this quantification has deeply reshaped the way the French state perceived religious expressions, especially those linked to Islam, in schools. This article, based on newly released archives, uses an interdisciplinary approach (history, education science, political sociology) to study these political and administrative phenomena.

AB  - Agricultural and Life Science (AgLS) research tends to focus on the need for a globally competent workforce prepared to work with diverse populations. However, as AgLS education mirrors society, minoritized populations in AgLS are marginalized and othered. Further, AgLS curricula continues to frame agriculture through a white male lens; consequently, current and prospective students note the lack of educational curricula focused on the experiences of marginalized populations. The purpose of this single-case study was to explore students' learning experiences in a new interdisciplinary social justice-based graduate course focused on historical and contemporary diversity, equity, access, and inclusion (DEAI) issues in AgLS. Findings are organized into four areas: (1) what students enjoyed most in the course, (2) race and representation, (3) students' perceptions of learning experiences and outcomes, and (4) suggestions for improvement. Students reported most positively on the readings, class discussions, and assignments (i.e., op-ed and social justice initiative). Regarding race and representation, students reported taking the course because they were seeking perspectives outside of the whitestream perspectives they had previously been exposed to, and because Black students were seeking agricultural diversity courses taught by Black faculty. Students reported positively regarding their experiences and learning outcomes. Last, students gave suggestions regarding the final research paper, course topics, and the number of weekly readings required. This study illuminated the need for AgLS educators to better address and embed DEAI in agricultural contexts, decenter whiteness in AgLS curricula, and work harder to diversify their faculty ranks.

AB  - Aim and background: The aim of this study was to investigate students' attitudes, rationales, and approaches to making open educational resource (OER) videos (a form of OERs) on sustainable development (SD) in order to identify students' competencies and effective pedagogical designs. Method: Students registering for a teacher training course were invited to design and create pedagogies, make OER videos, and share the videos on YouTube on five SD topics: sustainable lifestyle, campus, community, enterprise, and earth development. The students provided their weekly journals and a final reflection on the whole process of making the OER videos on SD. This study used qualitative data analysis and text mining methodologies to analyse students' process data of making OER videos on SD. Results and discussion: The analysis results revealed that making OER videos on SD needed students' ideational, inquiry, societal, and disciplinary competencies. Inferred pedagogical suggestions for practitioners to support students in making digital products on SD are to follow a linear pathway from ideational creation, inquiry process, societal transformation, to transdisciplinary reflection.

AB  - World-class science requires inspiration, so how can we spark creativity in the modern university environment? Creativity does not come automatically: in the modern age, factors from electronic devices to time pressure can stifle creative thought. Yet, to solve the major problems of the future, it will be essential to stimulate creativity in scientific research and teaching. Here, we bring together insights from the literature to offer ways to cultivate creativity in universities. We advocate for creativity at all levels of university culture within which students are embedded, from the students themselves, to teachers, to researchers, and to administrators. We found that, for students, creativity can involve accepting creative coursework and understanding failure; for teachers, it can involve being active mentors and designing creative courses; for researchers, it can involve conscious effort to make room for creative thought within pressured workloads, and researching across disciplines; and for administrators, it can involve relaxing restraints, allowing autonomy over courses, and encouraging cross-disciplinary learning and research.

AB  - Background: A growing number of educators have started exploring student-centered approaches to improve students' learning and satisfaction with courses and programs. While prior research shows a positive impact of such strategies on student learning, further exploration of the perceptions of traditional, lecture-based and other more inquiry-based active learning as experienced by students within the same university is needed. Purpose: To compare students' perceptions of the learning environment in studio-type courses within an innovative pilot student-centered transdisciplinary learning experience to the environment in traditional lecture or lecture-and-lab courses. Program description: An innovative learning experience that employs student-centered teaching strategies to engage students in the transdisciplinary exploration of technology and liberal arts within a technology-focused college in a large land-grant university. Sample: At the end of the first semester, eight students who chose to leave the program were interviewed. At the end of the second semester, eight students who chose to remain in the program and four students who left after the first semester were interviewed. Design/Method: Student were interviewed individually during the end of either their Fall 2014 semester or Spring 2015 semester. A thematic analysis was conducted. Frequency of occurrence was counted and compared for each theme. Results: The most frequently mentioned differences between traditional courses and this learning experience regarded instruction, assessment, and uncertainty. Students enjoyed the flexibility of a more student-centered approach, but struggled with understanding assessment and time management within self-directed transdisciplinary coursework. Student learning preferences appeared to influence their perceptions of each teaching method. Conclusions: Although results seemed to be influenced by personal preferences, time management and dealing with uncertainty were sources of frustration across both groups of students. Scaffolding students in these two areas may help students make an easier transition toward more student-centered learning environments.

AB  - Pupil research in school lessons in the sense of Inquiry-Based Education (IBE) is one of the constructivist approaches to education. Inquiry strengthens the positive approach of pupils to natural science subjects, encouraging them to study phenomena and processes taking place in the natural environment around them and use the acquired knowledge in their practical life. Geography as a school subject, due to the multidisciplinary nature of geography as a science, is close to natural sciences as well. This is because of the broadness of the subject of geographical studies, the complex (natural and cultural) landscape. The close links of geography to all cross-sectional themes make it a good support for teaching classical science subjects at schools such as mathematics, physics, chemistry or biology, environmental education. Moreover, the field teaching is one of the strong assets of the implementation of IBE in the school geography. Presented case study on the 'effect of noise on the surroundings' explores the facts mentioned above, in geography teaching. It verifies the pupils' knowledge and skills to adopt the basic principles of IBE in the practice. At the same time, it presents the concrete experiences how the children master the individual stages of IBE during the process of education.

AB  - Despite the increasing interests and practices in interdisciplinary science education, little research has been documented to develop effective assessments targeting students' interdisciplinary learning. In response to this gap, a team of scientists and educators developed an interdisciplinary assessment instrument targeting osmosis, which was chosen because it involves concepts from multiple disciplines and was identified as one of the most important topics by college instructors from different disciplines.

AB  - The use of system dynamics as a learning tool for developing sustainable energy strategies and environmental education has advanced in recent years with the availability of new modelling software and webtools. Among the existing models, we highlight the online 2050 Calculators, which aim at simulating scenarios for greenhouse gas emissions, energy planning, sustainable land use, and food consumption. The objective of this study is to assess the available calculators and their contribution to an interdisciplinary education via systems thinking. We carried out a review of the existing models worldwide and ran some of the tools with students from three different postgraduate programmes at master's level at Imperial College London (United Kingdom) and IFP School (France), whilst also assessing their individual views afterwards. The assessments were conducted once a year during three subsequent years: 2019, 2020, and 2021. The results are discussed under the epistemology of critical pedagogy, showing that the use of webtools, such as the 2050 Calculators, can significantly contribute to the students' environmental awareness and political engagement, providing important lessons about the use of system dynamics for policy and science education.

AB  - This paper discusses the potential of the creation and analysis of historical networks as didactic strategies in science education. To this end, we first argue the importance of combining critical approaches of the history of science with historical network research. This will be followed by a report of an empirical experiment in which the history of science high school students created historical networks of human and non-human objects using the ePistolarium platform in combination with other network visualization tools (Available at http://ckcc.huygens.knaw.nl/epistolarium/. Accessed on November 20, 2018). Finally, following this empirical exploration, we will explain how the creation of historical networks are in line with academic recommendations in Brazil, encouraging the development of projects by students and also using historical collections and computational tools, interdisciplinary teaching methodologies and approaches that can support the formulation of reflective questions about science. Negotiations between small groups of students that shape their historical networks in combination with mediations by the teacher in plenary meetings are the main characteristics of this educational project. Networks were made from students' observations, their research and their presentations. In successive meetings, the whole process was evaluated and the contribution of these historical networks to the history of science was discussed. Although we argue that historical networks can be a powerful instrument of collaborative learning, it will be demonstrated that their creation requires the supervision of teachers to prevent manipulations of historical data and biased interpretations hereof.

AB  - In recent years, there has been upsurge of interest in the applications of interdisciplinary perspectives on science in science education. Within this framework, the implications of the so-called "economics of science" is virtually an uncharted territory. In this paper, we trace a set of arguments that provide a dialectic engagement with two conflicting agendas: (a) the broadening of science education to include the contextual positioning of science including economical dimensions of science, and (b) the guarding of the proliferation and reinforcement of those aspects of economics of science such as commodification of scientific knowledge that embraces inequity and restricted access to the products of the scientific enterprise. Our aim is broadly to engage, as science education researchers, in the debates in economics of science so as to investigate the reciprocal interactions that might exist with science education. In so doing, we draw out some recommendations whereby the goals of science education might provide as much input into the intellectual debates within philosophy of science on issues related to the commercialisation and commodification of scientific knowledge. We explore some implications of commodification of science in the context of modelling and argumentation in science education.

AB  - Mathematical and scientific knowledge are integral to preparing our population to be actively engaged and responsible citizens. Science and mathematics education, however, has mainly focused on concepts and skills detached from societal implications. In this paper we present an interdisciplinary international design research study in which we developed teaching and professional development materials connecting mathematics and science education to citizenship education. We outline the design research process, its theoretical basis as well as the design products. The study shows that it is indeed possible to develop such approaches supporting active citizenship and thereby the development of 21st century skills in mathematics education, thus strengthening the role of mathematics education in the STEM field.

AB  - Picturebooks offer powerful supports for teaching diverse content across different curriculum areas. Research and curriculum resources document their use in inquiry-based education practices, particularly in relation to science and philosophy. There is, however, little theoretical analysis of this use or cross-curricular comparisons. Applying a systematic literature review process, this paper examines existing empirical research on the use of picturebooks in formal inquiry-based education contexts. The analysis considers the context in which the picturebooks were used, including curriculum context and class level, the role played by the picturebooks in the inquiries and the value ascribed to the use of picturebooks. The review proposes a framework for understanding and contrasting the varying roles played by picturebooks in inquiry-based education approaches. This framework involves seven uses: invitations, provocations, mentors, models, resources, touchstones and destinations. Varying benefits are attributed to the use of picturebooks, including their practicality, inclusivity, complexity, aid to cognitive learning, emotional engagement and association with child readers. These benefits emphasise both the accessibility and the complexity of picturebooks. The review proposes that inquiry approaches should attend to picturebook form and content and the interdependency of the two. The review's analysis supports extended use of picturebooks across the curriculum, including in history, geography, citizenship and science education, as well as in interdisciplinary approaches.

AB  - Nowadays there is a concern to improve the quality of education by including an interdisciplinary approach of concepts and their integration in the curriculum of scientific disciplines. The development of microbial fuel cells as a potential alternative for production of renewable energies gives undergraduate students the challenge of integrating interdisciplinary concepts in a hot topic of global interest as alternative energies. We present a laboratory experiment that has been part of a third-year undergraduate course in biology where students gained experience in assembling microbial fuel cells and the understanding of how they work. In this process, the students could integrate biological, biochemical, and electric concepts. In addition, the acquisition of manual skills and experimental design decisions are important for the development of future professionals.

AB  - Studying biology entails negotiating knowledges, identities, and what paths, more or less well-trodden, to follow. Knowledges, identities, and paths within the very practices of science are fundamentally gendered and it is, therefore, critical to recognize when exploring students' learning and participation in natural sciences. Even though students' numbers in undergraduate Higher Education Biology are female-biased, it does not mean that gendered processes are absent. In this study, we focus on early undergraduate biology students' identity work at a Swedish university, analyzing 55 study motivation texts discursively. Embedded in a Figured Worlds framework, we explore how students imagined and authored themselves in(to) the Figured World of Higher Education Biology along two imagined identity trajectories, the Straight Biology Path and the Backpacking Biology Path. While the first and numerically dominant imagined trajectory entails typical stories of a scientific child striving toward a research career, the latter recognizes broad interests and biology competences to be collected in a backpack for transdisciplinary use. Students imagining the Backpacking Biology Path authored themselves in relation to and explicitly not as having a linear trajectory, which positions the Straight Biology Path as dominant and culturally recognized. Our findings reveal gendered myths about science practices present in Higher Education Biology, yet also contested through alternative imaginaries. We, thereby, show that it is crucial for Higher Biology and Science Education to be aware of how students imagine their trajectories and how they negotiate masculine norms of science to create spaces for diverse and alternative identity trajectories.

AB  - Inquiry-based education has been part of innovative science teaching for the last few decades. With the competence orientation now underlying many national curricula, one of the emerging questions is how the development of student competences can be fostered in the context of inquiry-based science education. One approach to supporting students in their learning is formative assessment, which is, however, not frequently used in a structured way in daily teaching practice. The aim of this study therefore is to explore what kinds of measures might support science teachers in implementing formative assessment activities in their inquiry-based education. For this, firstly, we investigated the challenges that occur on a classroom level when using formative assessment methods in inquiry-based science education from teachers' perspectives. Secondly, we analyzed the teachers' suggestions on measures of support. Based on the respective results, this paper discusses implications for an implementation of structured formative assessment in inquiry-based science education to enhance student competences.

AB  - Background and Context: The Domain-Specific Programming (DSP) platforms EarSketch and TunePad are being used widely in schools for coding novices. Existing studies on both platforms have mainly concentrated on attitudinal changes, leaving a gap in the literature. Objective: The purpose of this research was to advance our understanding of two contrasting DSP platform designs that aim to achieve the same Computational Thinking (CT) learning goals. Method: Two mixed-method case studies were conducted in an authentic school setting to evaluate the design and use of EarSketch and TunePad. Findings: The results suggest both platforms enabled CT that contributed to interdisciplinary learning outcomes, but educators and DSP platform designers should be mindful of their respective strengths, weaknesses, and limitations. Implications: Each platform may suit diverse educational goals, considering individual student backgrounds and interests. Additionally, when designing DSP platforms with interactive graphical features, trade-offs for enabling CT should be considered.

AB  - Research has revealed that a small percentage of weekly instructional time in the elementary grades is dedicated to teaching science. Additionally, elementary educators receive limited preparation to teach science concepts compared to math or literacy skills. Therefore, this study examined if utilizing poetry to teach science concepts had a significant influence on elementary pre-service teachers' (PSTs) self-efficacy (SE) and expected outcomes (EOs) toward teaching science. Instructors in elementary literacy and science teaching methods courses collaborated to model strategies that integrated poetry within a science unit and mentored the PSTs in creating poems. Following the three-week integrative unit, analyses of the survey responses revealed significant increases in the PSTs' EOs resulting from their science teaching when integrating poetry. 92% of the PSTs believed poetry would help them integrate more science instruction and in greater depth. Moderate positive correlations were found between PSTs' SE toward teaching science and gains in: (a) perceived knowledge of science concepts, (b) belief that poetry would help integrate more science instruction, and (c) belief that integrating poetry would help students learn science concepts better. This study provides implications for informing teacher preparation programs, professional development experiences, and integrated curricula efforts to expand science instruction in elementary curricula.

AB  - This study aims to compare and contrast the connotations of the concepts of "science" and "history" that were formed in the minds of students attending both Faculty of Science and Letters, History Department and Faculty of Education, Science Education Department at Agri Ibrahim Çeçen University. The participants of the study are 173 students from the History Department, including the whole education level of the department and 71 students from Science Education Department including all classes. The participants were asked what they mean by the concepts of "science" and "history" and what connotations they made. Survey method is used in a descriptive research model. The Word Association Test (WAT) related to history and science has been utilized as a data collection tool. According to findings received after the analysis, it is found that there was no significant difference between cognitive sentence structures of the students, who are attending different disciplines, towards both the concept of history and science. As a result of the Word Association Test, although there are some differences according to the departments of education, many concepts in general are similar. When examining the cognitive sentence structures for the concepts, there is a need for research on the interrelationship of basic concepts with special areas. Thus, this research gains more importance.

AB  - A curricular approach to supporting low-income STEM Scholars is outlined and initial associations with retention, social and cultural capital, perception of science, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations are examined. Details are provided for the curricular support program based on interdisciplinary research, service learning, and an explicit examination of the interpretation of science based on culture and social location. We show that Scholars had increased retention and graduation within STEM majors compared to a control group. Further, Scholars self-report in surveys and interviews increased social and cultural capital, motivation, and related outcomes that they attribute to the interdisciplinary coursework that comprises the bulk of the program.

AB  - To evaluate the impact of a multidisciplinary, project-based course in introductory statistics, this exploratory study examined learning experiences, feelings of confidence, and interest in future experiences with data for undergraduate students in Ghana, West Africa. Students completed a one-semester, introductory statistics course utilizing the Passion-Driven Statistics curriculum. Results showed more than half of the students put more effort into the course and found the material more challenging compared to other courses, while nearly three-quarters reported interest in one or more follow-up courses. Importantly, students also reported increased confidence in a variety of applied statistical skills. These findings demonstrate the positive impact of a multidisciplinary, project-based curriculum on undergraduate students in Ghana, West Africa and demonstrate the potential for its global portability.

AB  - Quality of healthcare delivery is dependent on collaboration between professional disciplines. Integrating opportunities for interprofessional learning in health science education programs prepares future clinicians to function as effective members of a multi-disciplinary care team. This study aimed to create a modified team-based learning (TBL) environment utilizing ultrasound technology during an interprofessional learning activity to enhance musculoskeletal anatomy knowledge of first year medical (MD) and physical therapy (PT) students. An ultrasound demonstration of structures of the upper limb was incorporated into the gross anatomy courses for first-year MD (n = 53) and PT (n = 28) students. Immediately before the learning experience, all students took an individual readiness assurance test (iRAT) based on clinical concepts regarding the assigned study material. Students observed while a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician demonstrated the use of ultrasound as a diagnostic and procedural tool for the shoulder and elbow. Following the demonstration, students worked within interprofessional teams (n = 14 teams, 5--6 students per team) to review the related anatomy on dissected specimens. At the end of the session, students worked within interprofessional teams to complete a collaborative clinical case-based multiple choice post-test. Team scores were compared to the mean individual score within each team with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Students scored higher on the collaborative post-test (95.2 ±10.2%) than on the iRAT (66.1 ± 13.9% for MD students and 76.2 ±14.2% for PT students, P < 0.0001). Results suggest that this interprofessional team activity facilitated an improved understanding and clinical application of anatomy.

AB  - Evidence-based pedagogies to improve student success in STEM disciplines are now recognized, but their successful incorporation can be hampered by faculty wariness of novel pedagogical research. To support these pedagogies' effective implementation, a research team at a southeastern Historically Black College and University (HBCU) provided its faculty with long-term (2013-2020), incentivized professional development (PD) in STEM subjects, focused on faculty teaching development (TD). Over 6 years, PD/TD experts provided faculty participants with theoretical underpinnings and student outcome data, demonstrated hands-on strategies for under-prepared and differential learners, and addressed concerns that novel pedagogies could erode STEM-subject standards. Participants reflected on their teaching and learning foundations, examined their approaches and assumptions, and implemented new strategies. Interview and survey findings showed long-term, multidisciplinary STEM PD can help change faculty teaching views, even among those initially resistant. Although beyond our study window, ICFAIM collaborations yielded two DOE-funded faculty-developed interventions and team cohesiveness during the pandemic's shift to online instruction. ICFAIM evidence supports PD/TD that is: 1) designed to build on shared standards and knowledge; 2) provided incrementally over time; 3) focused on topics of concern to faculty alongside new ones; and 4) fairly incentivized.

AB  - Methods traditionally used to teach and train in STEM fields are being used to educate for careers in homeland security, Wall Street investments, and financial planning. An example of this trend is the increasing number of courses offered at institutions of higher education, such as financial engineering, computational finance, and risk analytics. These jobs draw heavily on STEM knowledge and skills, and represent some of the most rapidly growing or wealth producing sectors of the U.S. economy. To better prepare non-STEM majors entering these fields, we developed an interdisciplinary science course for nonscience majors with the goals of reducing the negative perceptions and attitudes towards the science general education curriculum. This interdisciplinary course also created a venue to teach non-science majors how to deal with real world STEM issues. By engaging students in activities which promoted skills critical in STEM fields, we designed a course that integrated a sampling of content in physical and life sciences, while at the same time increasing scientific curiosity and literacy. This new course, STEM 1200-Scientific Decisions in Everyday Life was taught employing active engagement techniques and student-centered demonstrations to increase conceptual understanding of scientific concepts. Results of a Wilcoxon Signed Rants test on a pre- and post-course assessment question showed a significant gain in students' confidence in their conceptual understanding as a result of the engaging demonstrations.

AB  - This paper delves deeply into the creative pedagogies which support cutting edge digital STEAM practice across primary and secondary school settings. It contextualises the research within current STEAM agendas including transdisciplinarity, and STEAM and technology and goes on to offer insight from the novel context of ocean learning to develop and extend a theorisation of creative pedagogies as entwining both creative teaching and teaching for creativity as embodied, democratic, dialogic and material processes. Intra-action between theory, praxis, nature, culture, the digital and humans enables an emergent perspective about changing the dynamics of power to develop ocean or environmental learning and related activism. Derived from research into an ocean education project, which aimed to develop students' ocean literacy through the combined educative principles of creative pedagogies and digital technologies (Augmented and Virtual Realities), the research draws on data from six projects across primary and secondary school settings in Denmark, Spain and England. It used a "diffractive" analytic technique, inspired by new materialist theory, to explore the messy mixtures of natural, cultural and technological environments that were being learned through. This involved the development of four material-dialogic assemblages each including diffractive switches. Each is presented first through a "piece" which demonstrates each assemblage's connection to the core question, followed by "ripples," which briefly articulate the new learning and questions arising from that assemblage. The four assemblages cover the irresistibility of making kin, the relationships between lively bodies and virtual environments, the importance of spacetimematter in environmental edu-activism and trajectories between transience, stability and dialogic space. The paper leaves the reader/engager with a selection of prompts to highlight the research's contribution to current STEAM agendas related to changing power dynamics, and to provoke reader/engagers' own practices. These can include new pedagogies and activisms, as well as theoretical developments to the combined educative principles of creative pedagogies and digital technologies within STEAM education.

AB  - Many physics teachers have experienced the challenges of implementing the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) in their high school curricula. These standards, based upon the Framework for K-12 Science Education, were intended to shift science instruction towards an interdisciplinary focus on three-dimensional learning, phenomena anchored explorations, and developing solutions for technological problems. The present paper describes a collaboration between electrical and computer engineers and physics educators, whereby a physics unit was created to embed engineering practices in the design of a night light. Although the project also incorporates aspects of crosscutting concepts and disciplinary core ideas, we focused on engineering practices since more educational resources are needed that illustrate this aspect of NGSS-aligned teaching and learning. The unit was piloted with over 1500 high school students in an informal outreach program, as well as professional development workshops for 100 secondary science teachers, with the intent that teachers would incorporate this and other engineering projects in their physical science classrooms.

AB  - This paper presents specific reference tools to provide institutional language integrated support with a specific language plan for a bilingual programme at the University of Malaga. This follows experts' opinions that claim the need of such a plan. While studies show the importance of language support in bilingual instruction, they rarely address specific content professors' needs tending to remain distant from real teaching contexts. The title "The language of learning" highlights the reality of bilingual classrooms to address specific needs of this unique academic scenario. The article examines how language support has a dual focus that includes both students and instructors. The paper concludes with a reflection on interdisciplinary innovation projects that provide professors with the tools to ensure the quality of bilingual programmes.

AB  - This is a hermeneutic phenomenological study that describes and interprets Wong's, the first author lived experience in the borderlands of science and Buddhist mindfulness as a science education doctoral student in Thailand. I explore my experiences in learning with multiple mindfulness teachers, including Thich Nhat Hanh from Buddhist traditions. and Additionally, I explore the affordances of being in the borderland of science and Buddhism, and how Buddhism can expand the border of science education through the inclusion of important topics, such as mindfulness, emotional wellbeing, and interbeing. This study also examines the roadblocks that are preventing deeper integration of science and mindfulness, including empiricism, scientism, individualism, materialism, and dualism. My standpoint is that to overcome the 21st grand challenges, teachers of science need to have the courage to cross the borders of various disciplines and help students develop essential skills for cultivating a healthy, balanced, and mindful lifestyle.

AB  - The insufficiency of teachers who teach integrative science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses is a major challenge facing science education today. Many teachers lack adequate expertise to combine disciplines and choose effective instructional approaches. This study examines how and to what extent teachers might succeed in teaching an innovative STEM program about a sound, waves and communication systems course in an information and communication technology-based environment. This research adopted a qualitative method to understand better the experience of three teachers who taught the course for the first time. Data collection tools included documenting mentoring meetings, observing in the classrooms and interviewing the teachers. The data were transcribed and analyzed using the content analysis method. The findings show that the teachers had only partial knowledge and, initially, even misconceptions about sound. However, their technological pedagogic content knowledge improved significantly due to the researcher's gradual but continual guidance. Four major factors contributed to the teachers' professional development: (a) dealing with innovative contents, (b) using different (advanced) teaching methods, (c) predesigning the instructional course materials and (d) offering the researcher-mentor's developmental supervision.

AB  - The aim of this research was to examine the potential of project-based learning (PBL) and everyday life contexts in developing primary pupils' scientific and engineering practices. Multiple data were collected in a Finnish primary school class; pupils were aged 7-8 years. The pupils' practices and creation of artifacts were videotaped and analysed using theory-guided content analysis. The analysis revealed that the designed multidisciplinary PBL unit placed within a familiar everyday life context enabled pupils to practice and communicate scientific and engineering practices supported with digital technology.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is a historic global event that has extended to all parts of society and shaken the core of what we know and how we live. During this pandemic, the work of STEM professionals has taken center stage. Through our close observations of how the events of the pandemic have been unfolding across the globe, we propose an instructional framework that emerged out of the real-time responses of STEM professionals to explain the pandemic and find solutions. This framework centers on data science, computer science, and multidisciplinary convergence as tools for engaging K-12 students in complex societal problems like the pandemic. In this theoretical position statement, we propose our framework that is grounded in three areas: (a) data science and computer science, (b) multidisciplinary convergence, and (c) orientation and support for science teachers specifically and STEM teachers broadly to prepare them for fundamentally different roles. Using data and computer models, students find phenomena and problems compelling, appreciate the power and potential of STEM subjects, and explain phenomena and design solutions to real-world problems. Then, through multidisciplinary convergence, individuals and societies integrate STEM disciplinary knowledge and practices to make informed decisions and take responsible actions. As STEM teachers engage students in explaining phenomena and solving complex societal problems with data science and computer science through the convergence of multiple STEM subjects, teachers take on roles that are fundamentally different from the roles they have traditionally played.

AB  - Although science education, including biochemistry and molecular biology education, starts before students commence university, for many students, undergraduate programs are their first real introduction to biochemistry and molecular biology. Students often report that biochemistry and molecular biology are relatively difficult topics hence the use of varied and well-thought-out approaches are critical to fully engage students. This session provided insights into undergraduate curriculum design.

AB  - Hands-on and practical learning has been key to cybersecurity education and training success. Cyber Defense Exercises (CDX) are a common approach to training, testing, and verifying technical and soft skills. However, full-scale CDX implementation is also an expensive training event. In order to advance such exercises to the next level, CDX organizers should further focus on educational, psychological, and cross-domain relationships. The paper discusses and proposes a multidimensional approach for CDX that balances cognitive, emotional, and social aspects critical for successful interdisciplinary learning. We share our experience incorporating knowledge from well-known psychology theories to CDX. We derive and describe seven elementary ingredients if a CDX is to meet the interdisciplinary and critical thinking needs of defensive cyberspace operations.

AB  - Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) represent an economical and practical way for institutions to equitably offer research experiences to large numbers of students. Although the benefits of CUREs are well documented, most CURE models are not guided by theory and are discipline specific, which limits their application. We used a community of practice framework to develop an interdisciplinary, authentic CURE course (Science Bootcamp) for first-year STEM majors. We describe the details of Science Bootcamp, then present assessment data verifying that the course includes key CURE design features (opportunities for collaboration, discovery/relevance, iteration) and successfully establishes a community of practice. Students who participated in Science Bootcamp reported psychosocial gains (e.g., increased belonging and science self-efficacy) from pre-CURE to post-CURE, a pattern distinct from a comparison group. Psychosocial gains, in turn, were positively associated with students' intention to remain in STEM. We also found that each CURE course design feature was related to at least one psychosocial outcome. Our authentic, interdisciplinary CURE model is flexible, scalable, and economical, making it feasible for institutions to integrate this approach into their own undergraduate-based research initiatives.

AB  - We suggest that two interpretations of time -- linear time and cyclical time -- that complement each other when planning lessons, can be used in both Western and Indigenous science. The idea of time in the Australian Curriculum: Science is examined and seen to be primarily associated with the Western science tradition, so it is suggested that the curriculum could be more inclusive of Indigenous ways of thinking with transdisciplinary links to mathematics also being included. It is suggested that the inclusion of the 'Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Histories and Cultures' cross-curriculum priority into science can be achieved in three ways: as Indigenous perspectives, through the Two-Ways approach, and through the Two-Ways approach with epistemic insight. Possible activities relating to seasons and cycles are suggested for the inclusion of these Indigenous perspectives in the science classroom.

AB  - This manuscript reports on findings from the implementation of the EU project "Science Fiction in Education" (Sci-Fi-Ed). The project provides teachers with tools, training, and guidance that will assist them in enhancing their teaching, making science more attractive to students, connecting it with real-life issues such as the environment, and providing girls and other marginalised groups with access to science resources, material, and learning opportunities. The central project idea is to achieve this by incorporating science fiction (Sci-Fi) in science teaching. The aim of this paper is to present the framework and the lessons learned from designing and implementing the project. We focus on the following topics: (1) theoretical and empirical underpinnings of Sci-Fi narratives in education: the importance of narratives in education, their benefits, and challenges; (2) interdisciplinary teaching and learning: the interdisciplinary approach, its benefits, and challenges; (3) practical guidelines and innovative teaching ideas: introducing Sci-Fi-Ed; and (4) briefly discuss the lesson learned from the implementation of the project in classrooms in five countries.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss the need for new approaches to research regarding coding to support students in developing practices in computational thinking, such as abstraction and decomposition, in multidisciplinary contexts. We explore students' activities with a tool integrating constructionist textual programming activity with game-based learning and specifically game modding. In this context, we designed a programmable 'design-to-play' game developed with the computational environment MaLT2. MaLT2 offers the affordances of textual programming, dynamic manipulation, and 3D navigation for the design of 3D animated models aiming to give children access to, otherwise, complex, computational and mathematical ideas. To develop an understanding of children's learning activity regarding computational practices, we organised an empirical study with middle-school students, who played a game called 'Code-the-Mime'. It is a charades-based game in which the players manipulate, programme, and modify a digital human model to describe a word to their teammates. The preliminary findings indicate that the affordances of MaLT2 in conjunction with the game context enabled students to express and develop key computational practices, including decomposition, pattern recognition, analysis and abstraction, in a meaningful and multidisciplinary context.

AB  - This qualitative study examines the influence of a 3-year professional development project for middle school mathematics, science, and special education teachers focused on integrating science, mathematics, and engineering in classroom instruction on participants' understandings of productive struggle in learning. Multi-disciplinary teams of teachers engaged as learners to use engineering design as a framework for integrating significant mathematics and science content supported by effective teaching practices. In this paper, we describe how the components of our professional development design supported teacher-participants to make sense of productive struggle in learning. In particular, participants noted that being able to experience design-based activities as learners and working through solutions with their colleagues supported their understanding of what it means to productively struggle, resulting in their growth as individuals and as teachers. The significance in this work lies in understanding how to effectively support teachers to buy-in to the meaning and value of productive struggle and how engaging in integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), design-based professional learning experiences facilitated that effort.

AB  - The aim of present research was to examine the effects of interdisciplinary teaching approach on teaching the topic of proteins. In the research, unequal control group model- one of the quasi-experimental research designs was used. The experimental group included 16 students (8 female and 8 male) whereas the control group included 14 students (6 female and 8 male) in this research- which was conducted with the participation of the 12th grade students. A lesson plan in which the topic of proteins was taught in interdisciplinary approach was prepared as the tool of application. A concept map prepared by the researcher and a 5-point Likert type of question were used in collected the data. The data collection tool was given to both the experimental group and the control group as a pre-test and post-test. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, a non-parametric method- was used in comparing the participants' scores in the pre-test and post-test of concept map and Likert type question. As a result, it was found that the application of interdisciplinary teaching conducted in the experimental group had caused differences in students' associating the concepts in biology and chemistry available in the topic of proteins and in their perceptions of their skills in this respect.

AB  - Nine years after reconceptualizing the nature of science for science education using the family resemblance approach (FRA) (Erduran & Dagher, 2014a), the time is ripe for taking stock of what this approach has accomplished, and what future research it can facilitate. This reflective paper aims to accomplish three goals. The first addresses several questions related to the FRA for the purpose of ensuring that the applications of FRA in science education are based on robust understanding of the framework. The second discusses the significance of the FRA by highlighting its capacity to support science educators with the exploration of a wide range of contemporary issues that are relevant to how teachers and learners perceive and experience science. The third goal of the paper offers recommendations for future directions in FRA research in the areas of science identity development and multicultural education as well as curriculum, instruction, and assessment in science education.

AB  - Background and purpose: The purpose of this exploratory case study is to describe how scholars negotiated disciplinary divides to develop and communicate to their students an understanding of the basic features of scientific knowledge. Our goals were to examine boundary crossing in interdisciplinary collaboration and to assess the efficacy of adding science content to an introductory Women's Studies course. Sample: We studied a collaboration between faculty in Biology and Women's Studies and evaluated science modules in a Women's Studies course at a regional four-year university in the Midwestern USA. The study included 186 student participants over three semesters and four faculty from Philosophy, Women's Studies and Biology. Design and method: Women's Studies and Biology faculty collaborated to design and implement science content learning modules that included the case of women and science in an introductory Women's Studies course. Qualitative data collected from faculty participants in the form of peer debrief sessions and narrative reflections were used to examine the process of interdisciplinary collaboration. Students exposed to curriculum changes were administered pre- and post-lesson surveys to evaluate their understanding of issues faced by women in science careers, the nature of science, and interest in science studies. Data from collaborators, student journal reflections, and pre-/post-lesson surveys were considered together in an evaluation of how knowledge of science was understood and taught in a Women's Studies course over a longitudinal study of three semesters. Results: We found evidence of discipline-based challenges to interdisciplinarity and disciplinary boundary crossing among collaborators. Three themes emerged from our collaboration: challenges posed by disciplinary differences, creation of a space for interdisciplinary work, and evidence of boundary crossing. Student participants exhibited more prior knowledge of Women's Studies content than nature of science but showed learning in the areas of scientific literacy and the understanding of issues related to women in science careers. Student understanding of science content was enhanced by the participation of a woman scientist in the learning module. Conclusion: This case study illustrates how creating an inclusive space for interdisciplinary collaboration led to successful curriculum transformation and academic boundary crossing by faculty participants. Success is evident in the legacy of interdisciplinarity in the curriculum and learning gains by students. Use of a feminist science studies framework was successful at helping students learn about the influence of values on science and the tentative nature of scientific conclusions. It was less successful in teaching the distinction between science and other ways of knowing and the conception that science is an evidence-based approach to understanding the natural world. This study highlights the importance of interdisciplinary teams of faculty members collaborating to help students learn about science by modeling that there are multiple ways of knowing.

AB  - The human resource skills gap in cybersecurity has created an opportunity for educational institutions interested in cybersecurity education. The current number of schools designated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and National Security Agency (NSA) as Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) to train cybersecurity experts are not sufficient to meet the shortfall in the industry. The DHS has clearly mapped out knowledge areas for cybersecurity education for both technical and non-technical disciplines; it is therefore possible for institutions not yet designated CAEs to generate cybersecurity experts, with the long-term goal of attaining the CAE designation. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the need for a top-driven, multidisciplinary approach to cybersecurity education especially at schools that have not yet been designated as Centers for Academic Excellence. The paper also suggests a multi-faceted approach and the important considerations needed to achieve a successful cybersecurity educational program.

AB  - The national conversation around undergraduate science instruction is calling for increased interdisciplinarity. As these calls increase, there is a need to consider the learning objectives of interdisciplinary science courses and how to design curricula to support those objectives. We present a framework that can help support interdisciplinary design research. We developed this framework in an introductory physics for life sciences majors (IPLS) course for which we designed a series of interdisciplinary tasks that bridge physics and biology. We illustrate how this framework can be used to describe the variation in the nature and degree of interdisciplinary interaction in tasks, to aid in redesigning tasks to better align with interdisciplinary learning objectives, and finally, to articulate design conjectures that posit how different characteristics of these tasks might support or impede interdisciplinary learning objectives. This framework will be useful for both curriculum designers and education researchers seeking to understand, in more concrete terms, what interdisciplinary learning means and how integrated science curricula can be designed to support interdisciplinary learning objectives.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine whether students' self-assessment (SSA) could be used as a significant attribute to predict students' future academic achievement. Design/methodology/approach: The authors address how well students can assess their abilities and study the relationship between this ability and demographic properties and previous study performance. The authors present the study results by measuring the relationship between the SSA across five different topics and comparing them with the students' performance in these topics using short tests. The test has been voluntarily taken by more than 300 students planning to enroll in the School of Business Informatics and Mathematics master's programs at the University of Mannheim. Findings: The study results reveal which attributes are mostly associated with the accuracy level of SSA in higher education. The authors conclude that SSA, it can be valuable in predicting master's students' academic achievement when taking specific measures when designing the predictive module. Research limitations/implications: Due to time constraints, the study was restricted only to students applying to master's programs at the Faculty of Business Informatics and Mathematics at the University of Mannheim. This resulted in collecting a limited data set. Also, the scope of this study was restricted to testing the accuracy of SSA and did not test using it as an attribute for predicting students' academic achievement. Originality/value: Predicting students' academic performance in higher education is beneficial from different perspectives. The literature reveals that a considerable amount of work is published to analyze and predict academic performance in higher education. However, most of the published work relies on attributes such as demographics, teachers' assessment, and examination scores for performing their prediction while neglecting the use of other forms of evaluation such as SSA or self-evaluation.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to introduce a methodology for analyzing the complex configurations emerging in students' speech and drawing activities, having consequences for how and what students learn and make meaning of in science. Accordingly, we launch a methodology to unfold the multidimensional communication as to deepen the analysis of the science epistemic discourse. We present an empirical account of students' explorations through different signs to demonstrate the construction of the methodology step-by-step. This methodology, a "seven-concept-assemblage," is rooted in Dewey's pragmatism and Deleuze's experimentalism broadening teachers' and researchers' possibility to target students' science explorations and meaning-making crosscutting different domains. The methodology diminishes the risk of interpretation when grasping unspoken messages and meanings. Empirical data were collected in an elementary school exemplifying the methodology and consist of audio recordings, photographs, fieldnotes, and students' drawings. The result reveals that the methodology in use exposed "what" and "how" students explored and learned cognitively and aesthetically. Imagination fertilized the process throughout. Learning then is suggested as a transductive meaning-making process shaped through oral and pictorial relations--always from a purpose.

AB  - Nowadays one of the main focuses of the Spanish University system is achieving the active learning paradigm in the context of its integration into the European Higher Education Area. This goal is being addressed by means of the application of novel teaching mechanisms. Among a wide variety of learning approaches, the present work focuses on peer review, understood as a collaborative learning technique where students assess other student's work and provide their own feedback. In this way, peer review has the overarching goal of improving the student learning during this process. Peer review has been successfully applied and analyzed in the literature. Indeed, many authors also recommend improving the design and implementation of self and peer review, which has been our main goal. This paper presents an empirical study based on the application of peer review assessment in different higher education BSc and MSc courses. In this way, six courses from different studies at the University of Malaga in Spain are subject to the application of peer review strategies to promote student learning and develop cross-wise skills such as critical thinking, autonomy and responsibility. Based on these experiences, a deep analysis of the results is performed, showing that a proper application of the peer review methodology provides reliable reviews (with close scores to the ones from the teacher) as well as an improvement in the students' performance.

AB  - Historically, societies have relied on universities and colleges to provide a space for young citizens to experiment with and explore the innovative approaches needed to address contemporary problems. Yet today, many universities serve as diploma mills that succeed in getting students onto the job market, but fail to give those students tools for real innovation. This article discusses the importance of college-level science classrooms practicing interdisciplinarity (combining of two or more academic disciplines into one activity). College-level science classrooms can practice interdisciplinarity by merging coursework at three levels: (1) between the trades and traditional learning; (2) among traditional divisions of knowledge (e.g., science and humanities); and (3) within traditional divisions of knowledge (e.g., within the sciences). Science courses could explicitly teach content and also explore real-world problems in lab sections. College science administrators and teachers can leverage role models by creating a culture of mentoring; by addressing heart, compassion, beauty, and critical thinking in the college classroom; thereby reclaiming their roles as leaders of progress and innovation, and thereby turning away from the diploma mill paradigm.

AB  - This paper offers a perspective on the relationship between communities that conduct research on teaching and learning in higher education, focusing on Higher Education Studies (HES) and science Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER). The paper responds to HES debates about the strength of its epistemological base and who belongs to that community, and to a perception that DBER is marginalized in the higher education research context. To explicate our perspective, we describe the origins and trajectories of Physics Education Research and Engineering Education Research, as exemplars of DBER. Using Turnbull, we conceptualize HES and these two exemplars as distinct "knowledge spaces," with different histories, orthopraxes and participants, and hence different unifying principles, research foci and trust mechanisms. We conclude that HES, DBER and other higher education research communities stand to benefit from multidisciplinary engagement with each other, because of their different perspectives on the problems of higher education.

AB  - The Center for Cybersecurity Education and Research at Old Dominion University has expanded its use of high impact practices in the university's undergraduate cybersecurity degree program. Strategies developed to promote student learning included learning communities, undergraduate research, a robust internship program, service learning, and electronic portfolios. This paper reviews the literature on these practices, highlights the way that they were implemented in our cybersecurity program, and discusses some of the challenges encountered with each practice. Although the prior literature on high impact practices rarely touches on cybersecurity coursework, the robust evidence of the success of those practices provides a sound rationale for applying them across the curricula. Challenges confronted included developing partnerships, introducing students to new learning strategies, and gaining buy in from faculty. Despite these challenges, the authors' experiences with the efforts also support using high impact practices in cybersecurity programs. Recommendations for other cybersecurity programs seeking to expand the use of high impact practices include integrating experiential learning throughout the curricula, developing campus-wide partnerships, embracing the interdisciplinary nature of cybersecurity, demonstrating the purpose of the practices, providing faculty development, emphasizing writing, and embracing failure.
