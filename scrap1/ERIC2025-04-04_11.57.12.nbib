AB  - Finding improved ways to train education researchers has taken on new urgency as federal legislation such as the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 call for "scientifically based research in education." The authors of this article suggest an approach to socializing doctoral students to a common "culture of science" (a set of norms for scientific inquiry) and preparing them for interdisciplinary studies that span the natural and social sciences. Drawing on developments in the fields of neuroscience, sociology of natural science, and the learning sciences, the authors argue for an approach to doctoral training that is consistent with a broad definition of scientifically based research.

AB  - In response to an invitation to integrate science and art pedagogy, science and dance students enrolled in specific disciplinary courses, collaboratively produced choreography based on scientific principles. This paper reports students' experience of this process. Science students reported an increased understanding of concepts, while dance students found inspiration for choreography within scientific concepts. Tensions and misconceptions were evident in the process with respect to disciplinary language, the notion of scientific thought, and the level of physical awareness. The relationship between movement and forms of knowledge production in science was investigated as well. The paper ends with recommendations for future classes.

AB  - There is wide agreement that ethical considerations are a valuable aspect of a data science curriculum, and to that end, many data science programs offer courses in data science ethics. There are not always, however, explicit connections between data science ethics and the centuries-old work on ethics within the discipline of philosophy. Here, we present a framework for bringing together key data science practices with ethics topics. The ethics topics were collated from 16 data science ethics courses with public-facing syllabi and reading lists. We encourage individuals who are teaching data science ethics to engage with the philosophical literature and its connection to current data science practices, which are rife with potentially morally charged decision points.

AB  - The paper provides a theoretical synthesis that addresses the multiple calls to consider the existence of an integrated nature of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). The nature of STEM (NOSTEM) has been advocated for as a way to promote effective STEM instruction in K-16 education and has been challenged as being non-existent. We propose a theoretical conceptualization of the NOSTEM through a convergent model that integrates the shared characteristics of the nature of knowledge and nature of inquiry practices of each of the four STEM disciplines. We propose this model in light of the siloed individual disciplines by considering the dimensions of each and whether they are pure or applied or attend to questions and issues surrounding the physical and non-physical world(s). Using this synthesis and model, we argue that the NOSTEM is congruent with the nature of engineering (NOE). This finding has multiple implications for all stakeholders (i.e., teachers, researchers, policy makers) in STEM education. First, we caution stakeholders from using this model to create or change educational policies or standards but rather work to validate, extend, and challenge the model in light of STEM education reform. Second, with the congruency between our model of NOSTEM and NOE, we charge scholars to work to illuminate the critical aspects of the nature of engineering "knowledge." Third, if the model withstands the scrutiny of STEM scholars (i.e., researchers and teachers), it has the potential to inform teaching and learning in STEM education.

AB  - The ability to read and compose original scientific literature is critical to educating informed citizens, yet may be severely lacking in undergraduate curricula. We developed a linked course offering in fall 2017 consisting of a 16-student group taking an introductory biology course paired with a first-year composition course. The composition course focused specifically on scientific literature composed in the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion (IMRaD) structure. In the composition course, instruction focused on helping students conceptualize and compose proposals, poster presentations, and manuscripts based on their lab activities. We surveyed for prior experience with scientific literature and self-reported reading and writing confidence. Participants in the linked courses showed an improvement in self-reported ability and confidence in writing compared to a control group that did not participate. We assembled a rubric assessing correct IMRaD structure and used it to assess composition before and after the linked courses. Adherence to IMRaD improved significantly for the Methods section. Our experiences indicate that learning communities can be useful pedagogies to provide students with confidence and learning gains that facilitate use of information and communication.

AB  - This paper explores Computational Thinking (CT) through the experiences and interactions of sixth-grade students as they were engaging in a science lesson utilizing robotics. This robotics unit institutes the shifting from traditional to engaging hands-on activities coupled with CT skills that are exciting, intriguing, and inviting to students. The constructionist philosophy, hands-on application learning, addresses social skills like collaboration, communication, and teamwork to provide an authentic, real-world learning experience. CT brings to the classroom exciting and innovative activities that infuse robotics with hands-on application platforms in the science and mathematics curriculum, but the education system has missed a core set of young open-minded eager students at the intermediate school level. With today's vision in education focusing on the 21st-Century learner, CT is emerging as a key component in the skill set necessary for the new generation of learners. CT poses a strong ideology based on problem-solving equally conveying an essential position in cross-curricular classroom activities. This session exposes CT through a study relating experiences and interactions by students when engaging in a science lesson utilizing robots. Focusing on how students engage the CT key concepts of: (1) abstraction; (2) decomposition; (3) pattern recognition; and (4) algorithm when participating in robotics activity.

AB  - Background: Little research exists which describes how mathematics and science constructivist beliefs are developed in a dual content mathematics/science methods course, and if beliefs within one discipline inform the other. If mathematics and science beliefs inform one another, then this would enrich learning in both disciplines. Purpose: The study's purpose was to (a) understand how a dual content methods course centered on problem-solving was able to concurrently enrich PSTs' mathematics and science beliefs, and (b) determine if PSTs entered the course with similar mathematics and science beliefs, and how these similar beliefs changed throughout the course. Sample: PSTs (N = 113) participated in ten iterations of the course. Design and methods: PSTs completed a mathematics and science belief instrument at the start and end of the course. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to determine if PSTs entered the course with similar or different beliefs in mathematics and science, and independent samples t-test was conducted to look for significant changes between the factors from the pretest and posttest. Results: Findings show that (a) the course caused PSTs' beliefs to become more constructivist-based; and (b) PSTs entered and exited the course with similar beliefs in mathematics and science. Conclusion: PSTs may have holistic constructivistic beliefs -- which stand in contrast to discipline-specific beliefs -- that inform the teaching and learning of both mathematics and science. Implications include that education programs should emphasize problem-solving and constructivism in courses outside of mathematics and science, to enrich instruction and learning in all courses.

AB  - The laboratory component of a first-semester general chemistry course for science majors is described. The laboratory involves a semester-long project undertaken in a small-group format. Students are asked to examine whether plants grown in soil contaminated with lead take up more lead than those grown in uncontaminated soil. They are also asked to examine whether the acidity of the rainwater affects the amount of lead taken up by the plants. Groups are then given considerable independence in the design and implementation of the experiment. Once the seeds are planted, which takes about 4 wk into the term, several shorter experiments are integrated in before it is time to harvest and analyze the plants. The use of a project and small working groups allows for the development of a broader range of learning outcomes than occurs in a "traditional" general chemistry laboratory. The nature of these outcomes and some of the student responses to the laboratory experience are described. This particular project also works well at demonstrating the connections among chemistry, biology, geology, and environmental studies. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)

AB  - This article describes a workshop, supported by the National Academy of Sciences and the National Institute of Health, that examines the current state of research about interventions that could significantly influence the participation of underrepresented minorities in pursuing research careers in the biomedical and behavioral sciences and other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The ultimate goals of this workshop are to help researchers develop appropriate kinds of research questions that measure the contributions of various factors to the success of such programs; to offer technical assistance on implementing effective methodologies for studying such interventions; and to encourage the development and coalescence of an interdisciplinary community of scholars and scholarly venues that are relevant to this area of study. The NIH also requested that this workshop provide technical assistance for those interested in conducting this type of research by exploring pertinent issues, such as developing researchable problems, designing experiments, and incorporating appropriate statistical analyses.

AB  - Despite collaboration among different professions being recognized as fundamentally important to contemporary and future healthcare practice, the concept is woefully undertheorized. This has implications for how health professions educators might best introduce students to interprofessional collaboration and support their transition into interprofessional, collaborative workplaces. To address this, we engage in a conceptual analysis of published collaborative, interprofessional practices and conceptual understandings in theatre, as a highly collaborative art form and industry, to advance thinking in the health professions, specifically to inform interprofessional education. Our analysis advances a conceptualization of collaboration that takes place within a work culture of creativity and community, that includes four modes of collaboration, or the ways theatre practitioners collaborate, by: (1) paying attention to and traversing roles and hierarchies; (2) engaging in reciprocal listening and challenging of others; (3) developing trust and communication, and; (4) navigating uncertainty, risk and failure. We conclude by inviting those working in the health professions to consider what might be gleaned from our conceptualization, where the embodied and human-centred aspects of working together are attended to alongside structural and organizational aspects.

AB  - In 2001, the Greek Government introduced sex and gender relationships education as a thematic unit for interdisciplinary Health Education activities. However, the diffusion of such programmes remains extremely limited. The present paper discusses how sex and relationships issues are presented in contemporary Greek primary school textbooks since textbooks play a central role in teaching and learning processes. It has been found that textbook references on a particular topic encourage teachers to select this topic for developing and implementing Health Education projects. In this paper the recent educational reform is presented, as well as the general guidelines for the development of the National Curriculum and Health Education Subject Curriculum, the contents of which determined the guidelines for the development of the new primary textbooks. Within this framework, the article discusses how sex education issues are being represented in primary "Environmental Studies"/"Science" and "Mother Tongue"/"Literature" textbooks. Findings support the claim that such representation is limited and single-dimensional, placing sex education at the margins of educational interventions in Greece at the moment. The marginalization of sex education, as it is argued, can be regarded as the effect of conflicting societal values. (Contains 2 tables, 1 figure, and 7 notes.)

AB  - The goal of this project is to develop a unique simulation environment that can be used to increase students' interest and expertise in Computer Science curriculum. Hands-on experience with physical or simulated equipment is an essential ingredient for learning, but many approaches to training develop a separate piece of equipment or software for each topic area. We describe the development of a simulation environment that provides a foundation for cross-disciplinary exercises. The Wireless Intelligent agent Simulation Environment (WISE), which combines activities from virtual and physical versions of the Wumpus World game, provides a dynamic learning environment that can enhance a number of Computer Science courses. In this paper, we describe the WISE environment design. We also describe steps for integrating WISE into Computer Science curriculum. As a demonstration of the effectiveness of the tool, we describe its use in the artificial intelligence, multimedia, and wireless networks courses at the University of Texas at Arlington.

AB  - Can art and science find a happy home in the same unit? We think the answer is yes, if the central problem interests the students and allows them to try out multiple abilities. The sixth-grade unit described in this article, which we called "The Dragon Project," grew mainly from two roots, a study of ancient China and a later probe into anatomy and physiology. The host institution was Ross School, located in East Hampton, New York. This campus-style exploratorium is noted for its interdisciplinary studies based on a humanistic core of world cultures. By "interdisciplinary studies" we are referring to problem solving that uses input from several subjects in a way that interests students more than traditional methods and content do (Walker, 2003). In this unit, aesthetics fueled the problem solving. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - Agricultural systems are complex and can be used as examples to teach science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) concepts. However, inclusion of agriculture in core STEM courses is often limited. Three professional development sessions for K-12 teachers were offered in 2021-2022 (hybrid or remote sessions) and repeated in 2022-2023 (in-person sessions) to highlight ways that agricultural plant production systems could be incorporated into core courses like biology, environmental science, chemistry, and math. Teacher participants asked how knowledge level and confidence were influencing their inclusion of agriculture into STEM courses before and after the sessions, and gains in knowledge on content-based questions were also evaluated. Response rates in Year 1 ranged from 8.0% to 38.5%, and usable response rates in Year 2 ranged from 47% to 68%. The availability of lessons or activities and teacher content knowledge both increased teacher likelihood to incorporate in three sessions. However, the additional time needed to incorporate new lessons was identified as affecting the likelihood to incorporate materials after the Year 1 ecology session. Teacher confidence to incorporate agricultural lessons or activities into their courses increased in four of the sessions, though teachers became more aware that limited resources are available to help increase adoption. Awareness of how agriculture can be used to meet learning standards also improved teacher confidence in four sessions. Average score on knowledge-based questions increased in all six sessions, but was only significant for two sessions. These sessions were successful at increasing teacher knowledge and confidence to incorporate agriculture into STEM courses.

AB  - The Hybrid Text Comprehension cloze (HyTeC-cloze) (Kleijn et al. Lang Test 36:553--572, 2019) is a procedure developed for the Dutch language that has been proved to be a valid and reliable measure of text comprehension beyond the sentence level. Given its advantages, including its relatively rapid construction and scoring and performance compared to standardized tests, we adapted the HyTeC-cloze procedure to create a version for the Spanish language. Therefore, this study aims at validating our adaptation. We extracted 18 texts from different school textbooks (Science, Language and History) and grades (6th, 7th, and 8th) and turned them into cloze tests, which were administered to 316 sixth to eighth graders from Chilean primary schools through an online platform. We also used a Chilean standardized reading comprehension test to evaluate the validity of our test. The correlations ranged from a low of 0.20 (for 7th grade) to a high of 0.58 (for 8th grade). Taken collectively, our data show a moderate positive correlation between both tests, which provide further evidence of cloze tests as a valid measure of reading comprehension beyond the sentence level.

AB  - "Ulysses" by James Joyce (1882-1941) has a surprising amount of 19th-century, classical physics. The physics community is familiar with the name James Joyce mainly through the word "quark" (onomatopoeic for the sound of a duck or seagull), which Murray Gell-Mann (1929-2019 -- Physics Nobel Prize 1969) sourced from Joyce's "Finnegan's Wake." "Ulysses," however, was ranked number one in 1998 on the Modern Library "100 Best Novels" list and is, in whole or in part, in the literature curriculum in university English departments worldwide. The fact that "Ulysses" contains so much classical physics should not be surprising. Joyce's friend Eugene Jolas observed: "the range of subjects he [Joyce] enjoyed discussing was a wide one … [including] certain sciences, particularly physics, geometry, and mathematics." Knowing physics can enhance everyone's understanding of this novel and enrich its entertainment value. "Ulysses" exemplifies what physics students (science and non-science majors) and physics teachers should realize, namely, physics and literature are not mutually exclusive.

AB  - While the multimodal nature of the languages of science is now broadly recognised, the role of affect and aesthetics in these languages, and the potential for this aesthetic focus to add to these languages, has tended to be ignored. Research into these languages has mainly focused on a codification of their functions, an approach to which aesthetics study would seem not broadly suited because of its ephemeral, complex, relatively unpredictable and affective nature. However, there is a growing awareness of its importance in learning. In this paper, we analyse a case study of art-science integration on the topic of optics to (a) put a case for the value of an explicit focus on aesthetics in science learning and (b) to clarify how teachers might integrate conceptual learning and aesthetic experiences into a broadened account of the languages of science. We argue that this focus on aesthetic responses needs to be included in accounts of productive science classroom discourse because such responses (a) enhance student motivation to learn, (b) enact generative sign-making in this discourse, (c) enrich student habits of perception in inquiry-based-learning and (d) licence more creative learning processes and outcomes. These effects are consistent with widespread policy advocacy of the need for students to find learning in science more meaningful.

AB  - A growing number of Introductory Physics for Life Sciences courses have been developed to prepare biology, premedicine, and prehealth majors for cross-disciplinary connections between physical principles and biological systems. Many students find it challenging to apply idealized algebra-based general physics to more complex biological systems. A novel biological case study was developed to teach undergraduates to expand their energy transformation analysis of a simple system--a bouncing ball--to a more complex biological system of a kangaroo hopping. Similar to a ball, kangaroos transform elastic potential energy into kinetic energy to power their "bouncing." Unlike the bouncing ball, kangaroos gain additional potential energy through metabolic processes. Students follow a sequence of guided tutorials that facilitate small-group learning as they evaluate quantitative data from video analysis with metabolic energy expenditures from literature to synthesize a real-world understanding of energy transformations. In this article, we describe learning progressions, practical tips for teaching, and lessons learned in this activity covering energy transformations.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to present the twenty-five-year evolving pathway of the European dimension in education in Croatia. Furthermore, the paper critically problematises the lack of a theoretical framework that has marked this concept's research and partly contributed to its conceptual dispersion and scholarly ambiguity. Design: The paper design is based on chronological and content analysis of the European dimension in education development, primarily focusing on the Croatian context. The period analysed is from 1996, when the first paper on the European dimension in education in Croatia was published until 2020. Findings: The development frame of the European dimension in education is proposed, with an overview of appurtenant phases, followed by chronological and detailed elaborated thematic groups. As an answer to detected theoretical deficiencies, the political praxiology of education is introduced as a direction of its future theoretical development and a partly new shift in the conceptual definition of the European dimension in education is proposed.

AB  - This article describes an introductory computational thinking (CT) lesson that was implemented into five educational technology classes at a large university in the southern United States. A total of 88 undergraduate and graduate students participated in the lesson. The project was the result of a collaboration between education faculty and a computer science professor from another university. The CT lesson was a basic robot design activity adapted for different course formats: face-to-face, online, and blended. The author's impressions of how the students responded to the activity, what they learned about CT, and future directions for integrating CT into teacher education curricula are also discussed.

AB  - Genomics profoundly affects society, because genome sequence information is widely used in such areas as genetic testing, genomic medicine/vaccine development, and so forth. Therefore, a responsibility to modernize science curricula exists for "post-genome era" educators. At my university, we developed a BS biotechnology program within a liberal arts framework, without major cost or radical curriculum revision. Outcomes have included enrollment growth, interdisciplinary opportunities, enhanced faculty-student research, and modern science laboratories that benefit biotechnology majors and nonscience students.

AB  - Expectancy-value theory of motivation (EVT) suggests that student values influence their likelihood of putting in the effort required to learn, and these values can be shaped by student characteristics, such as their experiences, sociodemographics, and disciplinary norms. To understand the extent to which these characteristics relate to students' values, we surveyed 1162 graduating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students across four universities using the previously developed and validated Survey of Teaching Beliefs and Practices for Undergraduates (STEP-U). The STEP-U survey included Likert questions to capture students' values of 27 cross-disciplinary skills and the frequency with which they experienced 27 instructional methods thought to develop particular skills. Exploratory factor analyses (EFA) showed an understandable factor structure for both students' perceived value of cross-disciplinary skills and frequency of classroom experiences. Using multiple regression, we identified differences in values that were associated with classroom experiences, STEM discipline, participation in undergraduate research, and student sociodemographics. Findings were generalizable across institutions and disciplines. The theoretical framework (EVT), the broad data collection (four institutions with multiple disciplines), and the type of data analyses (e.g., EFA) used provide theoretical, methodological, and practical contributions and suggest additional directions for future research.

AB  - This study examines the use of critical questions (CQs) as an 'explicit' pedagogical method in the nature of science to teach Chinese high school students topics of philosophy of science (POS). The study results, evaluated through deductive thematic and qualitative comparative analyses using Toulmin's argumentation patterns and a critical integrative argumentation model, revealed that students who participated in the POS course showed significant improvement in understanding and application of argumentation by asking CQs as suggested by instructors. This finding strongly supports the use of CQs for rebuttals in argumentation based on crisp qualitative comparative analysis. The study results have broad implications for how CQs can promote engagement in high school argumentation. The study conclusions highlight the limitations of oral questioning in classroom argumentation. Finally, the study discusses how POS can improve students' classroom argumentation.

AB  - The imperative for all healthcare professionals to partake in quality improvement (QI) has resulted in the development of QI education programs with participants from different professional backgrounds. However, there is limited empirical and theoretical examination as to why, when and how interprofessional and multiprofessional education occurs in QI and the outcomes of these approaches. This paper reports on a qualitative collective case study of interprofessional and multiprofessional education in three longitudinal QI education programs. We conducted 58 interviews with learners, QI project coaches, program directors and institutional leads and 135 h of observations of in-class education sessions, and collected relevant documents such as course syllabi and handouts. We used an interpretive thematic analysis using a conventional and directed content analysis approach. In the directed content approach, we used sociology of professions theory with particular attention to professional socialization, hierarchies and boundaries in QI, to understand the ways in which individuals' professional backgrounds informed the planning and experiences of the QI education programs. Findings demonstrated that both interprofessional and multiprofessional education approaches were being used to achieve different education objectives. While each approach demonstrated positive learning and practice outcomes, tensions related to the different ways in which professional groups are engaging in QI, power dynamics between professional groups, and disconnects between curricula and practice existed. Further conceptual clarity is essential for a more informed discussion about interprofessional and multiprofessional education approaches in QI and explicit attention is needed to professional processes and tensions, to optimize the impact of education on practice.

AB  - Issues like why students felt far from physics and did not choose physics as their prime learning option are familiar in education. This paper aims to study the effectiveness of the STEM-Project-Based learning module in physics on students' personal interest and sensemaking and effort. This research used the quasi-experimental model, employing a two-group pre-survey-post-survey design. Quantitative data were collected using the Colorado Learning Attitude about Science Survey (CLASS) instrument at two selected schools in Sabah, Malaysia, and Seoul, Korea. The sample size was 88 Form 4 students in Malaysia and 66 second-year high school students in Korea who learned classical mechanics. The students were divided into two groups, respectively, i.e., the experimental group (Malaysia=44, Korea=33) and the control group (Malaysia=44, Korea=33). Participants in the experimental group were intervened with the integrated STEM-PBL physics module, whilst participants in the control group learned physics through a conventional approach for eight weeks. Participants in both groups were then administered a pre-survey before and post-survey after the intervention. This research showed that the integrated STEM-PBL physics module significantly improved students' personal interest, and sense-making and effort after the intervention. The paper also highlighted the research's implications and suggestions.

AB  - The main concern of this article is to illustrate how West Point equips future Army officers with an appreciation and understanding of cultural knowledge. A unique, multidisciplinary goal-based approach to curricular design and assessment (of students as well as the academic program) is described, focusing on the structure, process, and content of student experiences that contribute to the achievement of the cultural perspectives goal. The author reviews what the institution's assessment data are telling us about student achievement of this goal and how we use this evidence to improve the academic quality of the curriculum. And finally, the article draws informative lessons from our experience, particularly in terms of models and processes that may prove helpful for other colleges and universities throughout the United States that are striving to ensure their undergraduates acquire a robust cultural perspective.

AB  - In this article, the relatively new phenomenon of integrating coding and computer science (CS) related concepts and skills into the K-8 grades is analysed through a comparative analysis of related provincial curriculum initiatives in Canada. First, provincial K-8 curricula that include coding and CS related concepts and skills are identified, as well as the placement of these components within the provincial policy documents. This is followed by a comparative analysis of stated aims and objectives of the curriculum components, and an analysis of the selected concepts and skills themselves. Throughout this analysis, context is provided by theory in the field, as well as the general approaches from jurisdictions outside of Canada, which have been found in the literature. What results is a comparative analysis of this nascent curriculum topic as well as important insights for educators, policy makers, and researchers alike.

AB  - Science educators are well-positioned to incorporate civic engagement into the classroom by the natural suitability of the subject matter. Civic engagement, or civic education, is a fairly new, multidisciplinary concept that is becoming a requisite for institutions of higher education; it enables students to become actively involved in the community and with topics of local concern. Historically, civic engagement has routinely been promoted in political science classes, but the new approach applies to a broader range of disciplines. Its' goal is to actively involve students in the community by participating in various discipline-specific activities. In the science classroom, opportunities for civic engagement are nearly limitless; there are many ways that teachers may engage students in community matters to encourage civic involvement and broaden student exposure to issues of public concern. In this article, the author presents  a small sampling of relevant activities that would involve civic engagement in the science classroom. Thus, the author states that by using civic engagement in the classroom, teachers may not only be able to educate their students, but also the broader community, in matters of scientific concern.

AB  - Statisticians and data scientists have been called upon to increase the impact they have through their collaborative projects. Statistics and data science practitioners and their educators can achieve and enable greater impact by learning how to create shared understanding with their collaborators as well as teaching this concept to their students, colleagues, and mentees. In this article, we explore and explain the concepts of common knowledge and shared understanding, which is the basis for action to accomplish greater impacts. We also explore related concepts of misunderstanding and doubtful understanding. We describe a process for teaching oneself and others how to create shared understanding. We conclude that incorporating the concept of shared understanding into one's practice of statistics or data science and following the steps described will result in having more impact on projects and throughout one's career.

AB  - The science education literature suggests that the public and students often hold narrow stereotypical views of scientists and science. Here we argue that it is important that students and the public understand the basis on which scientists make scientific claims. The inquiry sought to develop an understanding of the scientific mind, explored through Gauld's (2005) notion of "habits of mind". The vehicle used to explore these ideas consisted of an inquiry into how scientists rationalise conflicts between scientific theories and religious beliefs which are not in agreement with consensually-accepted scientific theories. Twenty scientists from different scientific disciplines and levels of seniority were interviewed using as a basis an instrument containing a series of religious-based item statements that a panel of scientific and religious experts considered were in agreement with a variety of religious doctrines yet in disagreement with current scientific thinking, or for which there is at present no supporting evidence from a variety of scientific disciplines. These statements acted as an interview protocol and formed the basis for interactive discourse, which was audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and participant-validated. These data provide a window into scientific thinking as practiced by modern scientists, and helps develop a picture of these scientists' "habits of mind". The findings suggest that these scientists, unlike their stereotype, hold idiosyncratic views of what constitutes good scientific evidence and sound, credible testimony.

AB  - This article presents a report entitled "Bio2010: Transforming Undergraduate Education for Future Research Biologists." The report is the product of an 18-month study by a committee of 11 eminent scientists. It examines ways to integrate mathematics and physical and information sciences into the education of undergraduate biology students. The study's sponsors, the National Institutes of Health and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, asked the committee to focus on students who intend to become researchers, especially in the biomedical sciences. The report concludes that significant advances in biological knowledge could result if interdisciplinary thinking and work become second nature to researchers and that connections between biology and the other scientific disciplines need to be developed and reinforced at the undergraduate level for this to happen. (Contains 1 figure, 2 footnotes, and a list of the membership of the Bio2010 Committee.)

AB  - The integration of science within an agricultural education classroom is very important. This study explored the influences CASE professional development institutes had on the teacher-participant's perceptions of science integration and inquiry-based instruction. This study utilized a pre and post-test comprised of the integrative science survey and the inquiry-based teaching techniques. We attempted a census of all (N = 38) high school agricultural educators who were participants in the Principles of Agricultural Science-Plant (ASP) and the Agricultural Power and Technology (APT) CASE institutes. Overall, respondents had more positive perceptions of science integration and IBI following the CASE institutes. Teacher educators should incorporate inquiry-based teaching techniques and examples of integrating science into preparation programs and offer professional development workshops to practicing teachers. Future research should take a deeper look into the impacts of CASE institutes on teachers' attitudes towards science integration and implementation of IBI in their classrooms. A larger population of teachers needs to be studied with the study taking a longitudinal approach to focus on the long-term implementation of IBI in the agricultural education classroom.

AB  - Scientific research has a culture that can be challenging to enter. Different aspects of this culture may act as barriers or entry points for different people. Recognition of these barriers and entry points requires identifying aspects of the culture of scientific research and synthesizing them into a single, descriptive framework. A systematic literature review encompassing a two-pronged search strategy, descriptive mapping of ideas, and consensus building, was performed to identify aspects of scientific research culture. This resulted in the Culture of Scientific Research (CSR) Framework, composed of 31 cultural aspects categorized as either Practices, Norms/Expectations, or Values/Beliefs. Additional evidence of validity was collected through a survey that asked biological researchers to indicate which aspects in the framework were relevant to their experiences of research. The majority of survey respondents (n = 161) perceived the 31 aspects in the CSR Framework as relevant to biological research. This framework provides a consistent structure for describing the experiences of people engaging with the culture of scientific research. The literature review included literature from multiple disciplines, so the CSR Framework should be broadly applicable. Future applications of the CSR Framework include identifying possible barriers and entry points experienced by groups currently underrepresented in scientific research.

AB  - In responding to COVID-19 anatomists have succeeded in adapting their teaching to online delivery. However, long-term reliance on this mode of teaching raises the prospect that transferring the whole of the learning environment to an impersonal digital world will lead to loss of anatomy's humanistic side. In looking to a future increasingly dependent upon digital input to teaching, a number of roadblocks are identified. These are: the peril of abandoning the ethos of anatomy; for the workload of staff and especially for female academic staff; by a lack of adequate resources; to the research nature of departments, including the quality of research; to the position of anatomy in the biomedical sciences; and from pressures to retreat from a dissection-based education. In tracing a future trajectory for anatomy, issues outlined are the inevitability of change, the need for anatomy to market itself to the world, and the opportunities presented for anatomy to view itself increasingly as a contributor to broad scholastic endeavors. Suggestions include exploring the possibilities presented by virtual anatomy museums, the use of online learning to reach those not normally in touch with anatomy teaching, and exploring the integrated courses with humanities disciplines. It is concluded that anatomy will flourish if there is a willingness to expand the traditional horizons and be prepared to integrate all that is best in the person-to-person and digital worlds.

AB  - This paper is based on an online experiment, conducted with bachelor students of educational sciences during the COVID-19 lockdown period in the spring of 2020. The experiment, which took place on a daily basis for a whole workweek, consisted of a series of what we have come to call "artistic-scientific interventions". These constituted a pedagogical praxis in which over a longer period of time students are challenged to collect and 'think with' artistic media as alternative ways of experiencing, studying, and evaluating the corona crisis. Our paper describes the structure and proceedings of this experiment against the background of efforts to develop a new philosophical idea of what it means to "do pedagogy." This idea, inspired by philosophers of science like Bruno Latour, contests some of the classical "divides" that run through the educational sciences, and that we believe pose a great threat to their relevance in current times of crisis: empirical/speculative, quantitative/qualitative, natural/social, facts/meaning, object/subject, etc. What our experiment shows, beyond all obsession with validating hypotheses or consistency of results, is that art, as an "education of the senses," can afford science with a much needed platform for (re)creating and/or (re)arranging circumstances in which those problematic divides may be overcome. However, what it also shows is that often this only works when art is approached, not through the lens of predominantly respresentationalist aesthetics, but as a full-fledged part of a scientific (c.q. pedagogical) discipline. Especially in a diffuse digital environment, this entails a need for "transindividual," "impersonal protocols" which allow for both repetition, variation, and feedback, and instil a strong sense of transformative gathering and "study."

AB  - Non-science majors often lack motivation to take science courses required for their graduation, because these courses are usually taught in a lecture format and are disconnected from their everyday life and needs related to future careers. This two-phase action research, utilizing argumentative writing (AW) supported with online simulation, was conducted over three academic years in a college chemistry course designed for non-science majors. Phase 1, a quasi-experimental design (n = 134), examined the treatment effects of AW projects and determined the components of AW that contributed to student gains in conceptual performance. The results showed that students in the AW group scored significantly higher in conceptual performance than the control group. Five AW components predicted student gains in conceptual performance: accuracy of claim, relationship between claim and question, relationship between claim and evidence, use of multiple examples, and use of appropriate writing style. Phase 2, a single group design (n = 118), explored the inter-relationships between pre-/post-course knowledge, pre-/post-course motivation, and students' performance on AW projects. The results showed that students' motivation to learn chemistry at the beginning of the course is a significant predictor of their conceptual performance. Pathway analysis found that the performance of AW projects in low motivation students was affected by extrinsic motivation (grades, career). Their performance in AW projects did not affect their post-course knowledge. In contrast, the performance in AW projects by high motivation students was affected by intrinsic motivation and self-determination. They cumulatively built knowledge through AW projects that eventually affected post-course knowledge.

AB  - Today, science is often regarded as a discipline that is more theoretical and less applicable. It is not clear how science works in society. The problems examined in this literature review are how the development of research on the integration of science, technology, and entrepreneurship in science learning in addition to how bibliometric networks and learning research trends integrate science, technology, and entrepreneurship. The search for articles using the Publish or Perish software was carried out on December 18, 2020. The data generated was in the form of metadata extracted from Google Scholar and Scopus through the API key, with the keyword science learning, STS, STEM, STEAM, and entrepreneurship from 2015-2020. As the result, 851 article was downloaded with their metadata which is stored in ris and tidied up in the delay. The data that has been obtained is excluded from proceedings, theses, book chapters, modules, theses, reports, and comments. Visualization with VOSviewer is carried out in three visualizations, namely network, overlay, and density. The results of the analysis show that the dominant topics are educational technology and environmental science. Research trends in 2020 are PjBL, entrepreneurship, and STEM. The less researched topics are the relationship between learning outcomes and entrepreneurship, and science technology.

AB  - The author is skeptical about the implications of neuroscience for education currently and into the near future. His skepticism derives from several concerns, but a common theme runs through all of them: attempts to link neuroscience with education pay insufficient attention to psychology. In this article, the author presents four variations on this theme. First, for those who are committed to developing a science-based pedagogy and solving existing instructional problems, cognitive psychology offers a mother-lode of still largely untapped knowledge. Second, attempts to link developmental neurobiology to brain development and education ignore, or are inconsistent with, what cognitive psychology tells individuals about teaching and learning. Third, cognitive neuroscience is the brain-based discipline that is most likely to generate educationally relevant insights, but cognitive neuroscience presupposes cognitive psychology and, to date, rarely constrains existing cognitive models. And fourth, the methods of cellular and molecular neuroscience are powerful, but it is not always clear that the concepts of learning and memory used by neuroscientists are the same as those used by psychologists, let alone by classroom teachers.

AB  - Growing interest in integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (iSTEM) education has been promoted as one way to increase innovation capacity, support future employment, and enhance learning outcomes in K-12 education throughout the USA. Existing efforts to construct iSTEM curricula have largely focused on finding points of integration among commonly shared disciplinary practices, but these efforts have not explicitly accounted for the distinct epistemologies of the disciplines. In this study, we critically examined the concept of iSTEM by conducting a thematic analysis of K-12 STEM learning standards documents to identify cross-cutting themes among the practices of the various disciplines. We then analyzed these themes using disciplinary epistemologies in order to highlight some promises and perils of an integrated approach to STEM education. We identified eight cross-cutting themes: communicating, investigating, modeling, using tools, working with data, making sense of problems or phenomena, solving problems, and evaluating ideas or solutions. Through our analysis of practices and epistemologies, we discuss the promises of iSTEM, including fewer learning standards, enhanced epistemic fluency, increased diversity and inclusion in STEM, and opportunities to challenge settled and siloed disciplinary knowledge. We also discuss potential perils, which consist of conflation and/or exclusion of various STEM practices and epistemologies. We urge continued examination of iSTEM with an eye toward the epistemic implications.

AB  - Scientific literacy can be promoted through oral and written argumentative practice. Collaborative discourse has proven effective in fostering conceptual understanding, especially when discussions are developed under deliberative goals. Likewise, writing tasks as argumentative syntheses stand out for its epistemic value and its contribution to constructive learning processes. However, there are no known educational interventions that have combined these two didactic activities to teach science. The objective of this research was to compare the impact of four intervention programs, based on deliberative dialogues and argumentative synthesis writing activities, on the learning of socio-scientific content. The four programs resulted from the combination of two instructional components (Explicit Instruction; Guide), while deliberative dialogues and argumentative syntheses were constant elements. We conducted a pre-post quasi-experimental study in which participated 151 Spanish third grade secondary school students. Socio-scientific learning was evaluated through a content test made up of open questions. The results showed all students progressed in their socio-scientific knowledge. Instructional practices did not have a direct effect on content learning. However, we observed an indirect effect of explicit instruction on learning socio-scientific content, through learning of argumentative synthesis writing. Besides, we found a positive relation between progression in synthesis writing and knowledge acquisition.

AB  - Interprofessional attitudes existing between healthcare disciplines can negatively impact communication and collaboration in the clinical setting. While human anatomy is a topic central to healthcare trainees, the potential of the anatomy laboratory to minimize negative interprofessional attitudes has yet to be characterized. This study aimed to assess the effects of an anatomy interprofessional near-peer learning activity (AIP-NPLA) on medical and nursing students' interprofessional attitudes at McGill University. The authors employed a convergent parallel mixed methods study to explore participants' AIP-NPLA experiences. The Attitudes to Health Professionals Questionnaire (AHPQ) was used pre- and post-AIP-NPLA to assess participants' attitudes toward their own and their counterpart profession. In addition, a focus group was held immediately following the AIP-NPLA to explore participants' experiences and interprofessional perceptions. Quantitative results using a principal components analysis demonstrated significant changes in nursing students' responses between pre- and post-AIP-NPLA scoring, rating the medical profession as being more caring overall. Medical students' responses pre- and post-AIP-NPLA demonstrated no significant differences. Qualitative results also suggested a breakdown of negative attitudes, an increased understanding of inter- and intra-professional roles, and the importance of interprofessional collaboration and mutual learning for their careers. These findings revealed that attitudes among healthcare trainees may be positively restructured in the anatomy laboratory, allowing for collaborative care to predominate in current and future clinical practices.

AB  - This article describes a general education course offering, Physics and the Arts. During the development of this course, physics and arts faculty collaborated closely. We cover the usual physics phenomena for such a course--light, color, and sound--in addition to gravity, equilibrium, and spacetime. Goals of the course are to increase students' engagement with physics and to develop students' ability to conduct scientific investigations. After the first offering of the course, instructors added two objectives: to involve artistic works regularly and to reduce math anxiety among this group of nonscience students. The laboratory activities follow a guided inquiry style and are listed in the article. The culminating lab activity requires that students create an artistic work of their own design, and the goal of the piece is to present a physics phenomenon or idea. Assignments and assessments related to the culminating lab activity are described in detail. The course increases scientific engagement of our students.

AB  - Reform efforts have renewed attention to science and mathematics integration and brought to the surface varied definitions of "integrated,""interdisciplinary," and "thematic." In an attempt to clarify the meaning of integration, eight manuscripts are presented that clearly indicate that the inconsistent use of language continues to exist and has significant implications for curricular organization, instruction, and assessment that extend well beyond simple semantic concerns.

AB  - The role of curriculum in the official educational process is widely recognized by the international scientific community. Beginning in the 19th century, and perhaps even earlier, curriculum research began, not only to be systematized, but to also constitute an autonomous field of study. On the other hand, curriculum evaluation has captured the attention of experts involved in the science of education over the last few years. This article will present the results arising from research with respects to curriculum evaluation in Greece along with a micro-model proposed for the evaluation of the Cross-Thematic Unified Curriculum Framework and the corresponding Individual Subject Curricula that are applied today in compulsory Greek education.

AB  - Current initiatives to transform undergraduate STEM education in the United States advocate for the use of multidimensional learning, wherein instruction provides opportunities for students to gain competency with fundamental or cross-disciplinary concepts and practices. To achieve this goal, the discipline-based education research (DBER) community is drawing on theories and approaches from the cognitive sciences to better understand how instructional choices may influence student cognition and performance. In this study, we investigate the extent to which adding visual representation to exam questions may alter the cognitive demand placed on the learner, thereby affecting exam performance. Exam questions were crafted in pairs -- one form embedded some necessary information within a visual representation, while the other comprised only text -- and distributed on exams across an undergraduate molecular life sciences curriculum. Comparison of analogous questions indicates that visual representation does affect performance on most questions; however, the nature of that effect depends on other features (e.g., format, cognitive level) of the task. Adding a visual representation to difficult open-response questions often decreased performance further, while adding a representation to similarly difficult forced-response items was more likely to increase performance. Drawing on cognitive theories of learning, we rationalize how the presence and interactivity of these elements may affect the cognitive load of the task and working memory efficiency. The findings of this study have implications for instructors regarding the design and interpretation of student assessments and call on researchers for deeper investigation of the relationship between student cognition and multidimensional assessments.

AB  - This paper dialogues with Lucy Avraamidou's theoretical contribution Science Identity as a Landscape of Becoming: Rethinking Recognition and Emotionality through an Intersectionality Lens. Avraamidou discusses the centrality of recognition for science identities, and presents an argument for taking up intersectionality as an analytical lens for recognition. In this response, I review the contributions that Avraamidou's article makes in advancing science identities research, and I then discuss ways of operationalizing intersectionality theory analytically. To illustrate ways that intersectionality can be mobilized to understand how recognition functions in science learning settings, I present examples from science identity researchers who have drawn on various theoretical frameworks to make this possible. I conclude with a discussion of the importance of considering space and time in recognition research, and how this can lead to more meaningful and intersectional research.

AB  - Metaphors invite. They contribute to our ability to makes sense of experience as they beacon us to make new (and sometimes playful) connections. In this text, I have created a postmodern metaphor, one willing to joyfully transgress disciplinary boundaries. Melding interviews, iconic images, snippets of academic text, poetry, and the power of metaphor, this festschrift "text" is at once visual, verbal, academic, accessible, and full of motion. Like the scholar whose work it honors (Ken Tobin), it gently pushes us into new questions about the lines we can draw between science and art.

AB  - This mixed methods study investigates student learning outcomes from undergraduate STEM and non-STEM courses, employing farm-situated place-based experiential learning (PBEL) modules at a private liberal arts university in the Midwest. Given that these courses occurred during both COVID-19 and U.S. police brutality protests, this study critically interrogates the influence of this "dual pandemic" on student meaning-making. The study examines how student scores on environmental science literacy, civic-mindedness, sense of place, and scientific reasoning measures changed throughout the PBEL courses. With the exception of scientific reasoning, change in each measure was statistically significant (p<0.001). A stepwise linear regression determined whether any measures predicted civic-mindedness. Environmental science literacy and university place attachment were found to be predictive of civic-mindedness. Focus group data revealed how PBEL modules affected student learning outcomes and how the dual pandemic affected student civic-mindedness and place attachment.

AB  - This case study involved year 9 students carrying out project work in biology via problem-based learning. The purpose of the study was to (a) find out how students approach and work through ill-structured problems, (b) identify some issues and challenges related to the use of such problems, and (c) offer some practical suggestions on the implementation of problem-based project work. Data sources included observation and field notes, students' written documents, audiotapes and videotapes of students at work, and student interviews. The findings showed that several students initially experienced difficulties in identifying a problem themselves but after discussing with family and friends, were able to overcome this initial barrier and subsequently formulated personally meaningful problems for investigation. The ill-structured problems stimulated students to pose questions which charted their courses of action, leading to independent inquiry. Students were led to investigate multidisciplinary elements beyond the boundaries of typical school science, and also learned about different modes of inquiry. The issues and challenges identified included identifying a problem for investigation; asking questions to negotiate the learning pathway; deciding what areas to pursue, given a multitude of possibilities; and figuring out how to extract relevant information from the available mass. Implications of the findings for instructional practice are discussed.

AB  - Governments the world over require scientific knowledge to inform policy makers' decision-making processes. The recontextualization of this information for nonscientific audiences has received much attention, though it has primarily focused on publicly available texts. Little is known about the discursive nature of how science is transformed and repurposed and the confidential writing performed by boundary organizations that are working between science and policy. This ethnographic study explores the collaborative discursive activity involved in efforts by a boundary organization--the Council of Canadian Academies--to recontextualize science for policy makers. The analysis opens the discursive black box of the genre system and intermediary genre sets involved in one project, which led to the publication and distribution of the boundary object of an advisory report, "Older Canadians on the Move." I claim that the discursive boundary work involves a complex genre system containing several sequential genred activities through which science is transformed and a boundary object created.

AB  - The contemporary world of knowledge, characterized by an explosion of information and ways of communicating it, requires creativity more than ever in handling scientific knowledge. Thus, science education, especially for the gifted, must encourage the development of creativity. But, as creativity is not something that can simply be taught, we must create the conditions for its development. The main condition is freedom to raise original unorthodox ideas, freedom to deal with complex issues even when the student's body of knowledge is insufficient, and, most importantly, freedom to fail. This article describes, through examples, the main principles of the science education program in the Israel Arts and Science Academy and how the foregoing ideas are translated and applied there.

AB  - Combining mathematical and physical understanding in reasoning is difficult, and a growing body of research shows that students experience problems with the combination of physics and mathematics in reasoning beyond the introductory level. We investigated students' reasoning about boundary conditions (BCs) for the diffusion equation by conducting exploratory task-based, think-aloud interviews with twelve undergraduate students majoring in physics or mathematics. We identified several difficulties students experienced while solving the interview task and categorized them using the conceptual blending framework. This framework states that in reasoning, people draw from separate input spaces, in this case the mathematics and the physics input space, to form a blended space, where they make connections between elements from these spaces. To identify difficulties, we used open coding techniques. We observed few difficulties in the physics space. In the mathematics space, we identified several difficulties that we clustered in two main groups: findings about the mathematical meaning of BCs, and findings about reasoning with functions of two variables. Lastly, we identified four ways in which blending failed. Starting from our findings, we formulate recommendations for teaching and future research.

AB  - University art and design programs are branching out and creating cross-disciplinary programs and research centers that connect design students and faculty across various disciplines such as business, engineering, architecture, information studies, health sciences and education. A human-centered, problem-based approach to design research looks to position industry and academic leaders to work alongside students, community leaders, artists and non-profits to develop creative and innovative solutions to the challenges facing contemporary society. But, as these challenges become more global in scope, participatory design research and the Internet become critical tools in addressing cultural differences in visual and verbal messages. This paper looks at the role of social networking tools and participatory research in addressing cross-cultural and multicultural challenges. It addresses the question: can the use of classroom collaboration, participatory design research and online critique and workspaces encourage creativity, innovation and critical thinking in student and professional designers?

AB  - The Professional Science Master's (PSM) degree is a creative addition to US graduate education, expressly to support innovation and workforce development in a globally competitive economy. Initiated in the 1990s with funding from two US private foundations, there is still a question as to whether universities will sustain it beyond the start-up phase. The degree is designed to prepare graduates for professional employment in which a combination of technical and management functions come together. PSM programmes combine solid advanced science/mathematics, a working knowledge of business principles, experience working in interdisciplinary groups and high-level communication and technical skills, capped by internships in business, government and industry.

AB  - Computing is a complex, multidisciplinary field that requires a range of professional proficiencies. Computing students are expected to develop in-depth knowledge and skills, integrate and apply their knowledge flexibly to solve complex problems, and work successfully in teams. However, many students who graduate with degrees in computing fail to meet these expectations. In addressing these challenges, Kun Huang, Yifei Dong, and Xun Ge have been inspired by the success of many open source software development (OSSD) communities. Using a design-based research approach, their study proposes an alternative solution to the current problems in computing education. Specifically, after examining a successful open-source software development community, Huang, Dong, and Ge analyzed and summarized its characteristics: projects as shared enterprise, motivation in joining the OSSD community, distributed expertise and expanded community, careful and systematic project planning, collaborative knowledge building, and OSSD system affordances. Using these features as design guidelines, they developed a software engineering class with its own OSSD environment. In this article they describe the course itself, share their initial findings of its pedagogical benefits, and discuss the implications of their continuing research for the future of computing education.

AB  - Integrated science is a ubiquitous school subject that is found in primary and middle-school levels around the world. Being a hybrid subject comprising several science disciplines, it poses many challenges to teachers as they are obliged to teach beyond their disciplinary comfort zones. In addition, this subject is prone to a lack of coherence, which helps people see how a small number of key ideas in a discipline can build upon each other to deepen understanding. Using integrated science textbooks from mainland China since 1990 as a case study, their (i) disciplinary emphasis (i.e. which topics & disciplines were emphasised) and, (ii) coherence of topics were therefore examined. The results showed that physical science topics were heavily and consistently emphasised in these textbooks, which likewise corresponded with the high number of buttress topics found in this discipline. Life science topics were the next most emphasised followed by earth science ones, a trend present since the 1990s in this country. We conclude with implications for improving science teacher training/professional development as well as student scientific literacy from this study of disciplinary emphasis and coherence in integrated science textbooks.

AB  - Purpose: The 'globalisation backlash' poses a challenge to society and civic education. This article develops future approaches to teaching globalisation by drawing on past concepts of economic education. Approach: An in-depth literature review on the contemporary challenges of globalisation is given and compared to the conventional approaches of teaching globalisation. Past concepts of economic education are introduced and examined for their applicability in this context. Findings: Since the 'globalisation backlash' is rooted in subjective experiences of the local environment, approaches such as lifeworld-orientation are useful to activated students' understandings. Socio-economic approaches can complement this with sociological, economic, and political theories that reveal the mechanisms behind personal experiences. Practical implications: Diagnostic teaching becomes necessary to link the students' realm of experience and globalised reality. [Note: The page numbers (93-95) shown following page 124 are incorrect.

AB  - A widespread call has been made to develop and support more integrated approaches to STEM education. The first law of thermodynamics serves as a guiding principle for the crosscutting concept of energy and matter. A qualitative interview study was undertaken to support integrated approaches to STEM education by exploring how chemistry, physics, and engineering students (n = 40) transfer first law concepts across disciplinary contexts. Acquired interview data were analysed through the lens of the dynamic transfer framework to reveal the underlying contextual elements students used to know with. Emergent trends across the disciplines revealed how these applied reasoning approaches and epistemologies were realised by each discipline. Productive transfer is shown to be facilitated by the coordination of different disciplinary epistemologies. Suggestions are made to practitioners on how to support students in applying different reasoning approaches when addressing first law problems. The applied methods also serve as a promising methodology for future investigation of students' transfer of crosscutting concepts.

AB  - To meet the demands of industry, undergraduate business curricula must evolve to prepare analytics-enabled professionals in fields such as finance, accounting, human resource management, and marketing. In this article, we provide a case study of developing a rigorous, integrated finance and data analytics course that was delivered using a simultaneous team-teaching approach within a regional, teaching university. This case study describes developing the learning outcomes; defining the integrated teaching approach; identifying and developing course content and materials; and planning the course delivery. Next, we describe the course delivery, including student achievement of course learning outcomes, and a summary of student feedback from end-of-course evaluations is provided. Finally, we present lessons learned from delivering the course and provide considerations for future work such as scaling this course and replicating it in other business domains.

AB  - Undergraduate research experiences have been widely demonstrated as a beneficial and essential component of the college experience. However, many community colleges face barriers and lack of support in implementing such research programs, which means a significant number of community college students miss out on these impactful experiences. Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) represent a feasible way to increase access to research experiences within community colleges. To investigate whether these CURE opportunities resulted in comparable to 4-year university CURE students, a CURE program was developed across various disciplines in a large community college and the impact on community college students was assessed. Analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data showed that students reported improvement in research skills, increases in confidence, and increases in educational aspirations. Peer interactions and instructor relationships in CUREs were identified as key factors associated with increases in research skills. Key factors associated with increases in educational aspirations included confidence in research-based courses, seeking additional research opportunities, and building a meaningful relationship with the instructor, but only if confidence increased as well. Our findings indicate that CUREs positively impact student outcomes in the community college setting and may provide increased access to research experiences.

AB  - In this study, a learning unit on microorganisms for ninth-grade students was developed based on the Science-Technology-Environment-Society (STES) approach. The learning unit contained 15 learning tasks, which were performed in individual and cooperative learning settings, using a variety of teaching/learning methods with an emphasis on the interdisciplinary approach. The study goals were to investigate the impact of the learning unit on ninth-grade students' cognitive and meta-cognitive domains and attitudes toward peace. The sample included 91 students from two classes in villages A and B, and one class of gifted students in Arab schools in the north of Israel. The unit enabled the evaluation of the learning process through students' portfolios, semi-built-in interviews, and closed questionnaires toward environment and peace. Both, quantitative and the qualitative analyses were used. The portfolio content analysis showed a significant improvement on the cognitive and meta-cognitive knowledge of the students, including asking questions, higher order cognitive skills, argumentation skills, self-evaluation and reflection. Triangulation of data assured the high reliability of the results, which revealed a significant improvement in attitudes toward environment and peace. We therefore suggest developing the concept STES to STEPS: Science-Technology-Environment-Peace-Society.

AB  - Along with inquiry-based teaching, exploring the elements of art can guide students to view and represent objects realistically. Understanding line, shape, color, value, form, space, and texture helps bridge the gap between what students actually observe and what their preconceived ideas about the object may be. This type of explicit instruction prevents misconceptions. If teaching science process skills through an art venue presents a challenge, try collaborating with an art teacher or with other colleagues to introduce the art element activities. With the focus on language arts and math, elementary students have had little art instruction, so this is an appropriate lesson for elementary students of any age. In order to develop observational skills and perspective, it is imperative for children to understand art elements. Furthermore, facilitating a connection between science, art, and the familiar environment will enhance and strengthen children's learning. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - Exposure to information about genetics is at an all-time high, while a full understanding of the biocultural complexity of human difference is low. This paper demonstrates the value of an "anthropological approach" to enhance genetics education in biology, anthropology, and other related disciplines, when teaching about human differences such as race/ethnicity, sex/gender, and disability. As part of this approach, we challenge educators across social and natural sciences to critically examine and dismantle the tacit cultural assumptions that shape our understanding of genetics and inform the way we perceive (and teach about) human differences. It calls on educators from both social and natural science disciplines to "de-silo" their classrooms and uses examples from our biological anthropology and sociocultural anthropology classrooms, to demonstrate how educators can better contextualize the "genetics" of human difference in their own teaching. Numerous opportunities to transform our teaching exist, and we are doing a disservice to our students by not taking these critical steps.

AB  - Many middle school students perform below grade-level standards in reading (National Center for Education Statistics, Washington, 2019), and recent observation studies demonstrate middle school teachers' limited use of reading comprehension practices within content area instruction (e.g., science and social studies; as reported by Greenleaf (in: Hinchman (ed) Adolescent literacies: A handbook of practice-based research, Guilford Press, 2017)). In this experimental pilot study, we aimed to boost middle schoolers' reading comprehension outcomes by providing schoolwide professional development (PD) on integrating reading comprehension practices within content instruction for English language arts, social studies, and science teachers. Six schools were matched into pairs and randomized to the schoolwide PD or a business-as-usual (BAU) condition. Content area teachers in schools assigned to the PD condition received distributed PD resources to support implementation, and coaching in one reading comprehension practice in the fall (i.e., get the gist) and one in the spring (i.e., asking and answering questions). Contrary to traditional PD, this PD was implemented across three content areas, was narrow in scope but long in duration (one practice per semester), focused on practices that could feasibly be integrated into content area instruction, and included ongoing coaching in content area teams. Students in schools assigned to the PD condition significantly outperformed those in the BaU condition on a measure of main idea generation (ES = 0.29) but not on measures of asking and answering questions (ES = 0.11) and general reading comprehension (ES = - 0.09). Findings suggest promise for implementing schoolwide approaches embedded within content area instruction to improve reading comprehension performance for middle school students.

AB  - This study focuses on post-induction mentoring as a vehicle for science teachers' training in implementing a nanotechnology teaching-learning sequence. Five mentors and 15 mentee-teachers participated in a 9-months long mentoring programme. Qualitative methods of analysis were used to examine the content of the mentoring conversations and the employed mentoring practices. Our findings indicate that the focus of the mentoring conversations was mainly set on the necessary strategies for teaching nanotechnology and secondarily on the resolution of organisational issues that arose. As regards the mentoring activities, mentors tended to address the arisen issues by giving advice, sharing their knowledge and teaching materials and by modelling the conduct of the lessons. The paper highlights the contribution of mentoring to the professional growth of post-induction teachers mainly in terms of broadening their teaching repertoire on nanotechnology issues.

AB  - There has been longstanding interest in students' aesthetic feelings in engaging with school science, but new multimodal accounts of meaning-making, and changing curricular goals where science is integrated with other subjects, pose new methodological challenges for researching these feelings. In this paper, we aim to synthesise relevant literature as the bases for proposing methodological practices to address these new research challenges. We draw on past and current pragmatist and semiotic perspectives to justify our methodological approach. We claim that research on aesthetic feelings needs to identify: (a) the complex nature of aesthetic meaning/feeling processes and multiple influences on these processes and (b) short-term and longer-term consequences on participants' taste for, and learning in, science. Building on a practical epistemology, we propose that these questions can be addressed through multimodal analyses of aesthetic intentions and responses when embedded in teacher and student inquiry purposes, discursive interactions, artefact-making, and evaluative feelings/judgements. To illustrate the scope and challenges of these methodological strategies, we draw on examples of analyses in companion papers in this special issue, both when science is taught alone and when integrated with other subjects.
