AB  - We outline an instructional strategy for supporting students' science literacy skills using a structured decision-making tool in an interdisciplinary undergraduate course. Instructional tools support basing complex socioscientific issues decisions on a reasoned analysis of tradeoffs among multiple conflicting values rather than heuristics, such as social norms. We explored the factors related to students' decision-making about mountain lion management by examining if students' value orientations, identity, or knowledge predicted their management decisions before, during, and after engaging in structured decision-making where they performed a tradeoffs analysis. We found that student decision-making may align more closely to students' value orientations and identity at the beginning of the course, suggesting that by the end of the course, students were less likely to make decisions centered in social norms and simplified single-value heuristics. A structured decision-making tool can be an effective way to support students' examination of value tradeoffs when solving complex socioscientific issues.

AB  - Due to increased need of professionals on the future labour market with competence in programming, many countries have integrated programming in kindergarten to grade 12 (K-12) education. In 2017, programming was integrated in Swedish primary and secondary school curriculum and the courses of Mathematics and Technology. Research has highlighted challenges in integrating programming and other new technologies, and the need for better teacher support. The aim of the study was to examine what programming affords secondary school courses in Mathematics and Technology according to teachers that use programming in these two courses. The study was conducted with a qualitative approach and collected data through interviews with 19 teachers that use programming in secondary school courses of Mathematics and/or Technology. Thematic analysis with inductive-deductive approach was used to analyse the collected data. Theory of Affordances was used to identify themes of interests in the collected material and group these into categories. Ten programming affordances are identified in this study: 1) flexibility, 2) creativity, 3) efficiency, 4) visualisation, 5) fun, 6) curiosity, 7) play, 8) holistic views, 9) fearlessness, and 10) interdisciplinary collaborations. Through discussion and comparison with previous research, these programming affordances are found to relate to three aspects of teaching and learning in secondary school Mathematics and Technology: A) support course content and learning, B) facilitate engagement and motivation, and C) foster developmental skills. The study concludes with a suggestion for a conceptual model on what programming can afford school courses in Mathematics and Technology, based on the findings of the study. Findings can be used by teachers, policymakers and other stakeholders in the integration and design of programming in secondary education.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine undergraduate students' satisfaction levels through learning with peers. Specifically, students from two departments were brought into a collective group activity to understand whether they experienced different levels of satisfaction by working with peers from a different department. Data gathered from a sample of 47 Science Education (SE) and 72 Computer Education and Instructional Technology (CEIT) students during the fall 2011 semester. Students overall were highly satisfied. Students of the two departments did not significantly differ from each other in terms of satisfaction. That means they equally enjoyed the activity. There were six themes that were identified that cause satisfaction in this interprofessional work: Performing responsibilities, socialization, cohesion, work habits, learning in general, and professional development. The most prominent theme was cohesion, and it emerged out of mostly positive but also negative student opinions. The least prominent was professional development and it was mainly expressed as a positive theme. It is argued that students do not articulate the scope of the study as much as they can. It is also argued that the nature of the assigned task let them consider the social aspects more than the other aspects.

AB  - This work analyzes spontaneous cooperation between children who participated in Automata for STEM, European Union funded Erasmus+ project workshops. Taking into account the characteristics of automata, that involve a narrative part and a mechanism, the project used them to implement contextualized and interdisciplinary STEM activities. The pedagogical method involved the presentation of automata, and children being challenged to plan and construct their own. Although no cooperative learning strategies were imposed during the workshops, this research aimed to identify types of spontaneous cooperation that could emerge among children. Data was gathered through participant observation and a questionnaire. Core dimensions of spontaneous cooperation were identified as well as specific dimensions, pointing to a divergent type, characterized by involvement between pairs of children in different projects, and to another type, convergent, involving work between pairs of children in the same project. Spontaneous cooperation also varied according to the children's age or the workshop structure. During workshops with children aged 6-7 years, the class teacher was present and provided guidance, the children were seated in pairs or in a presentation arrangement. During workshops for older children of 8-9 years of age, there was less guidance and the class teacher sometimes was not even in the room the children worked at round tables.

AB  - Aquaponics is the combination of aquaculture and hydroponic technology to grow fish and plants together. While aquaponics can play a role in food security, it may also be a potential educational tool because of its interdisciplinary nature and required technological skills. With aquaponics, students could conduct activities involving chemistry, physics, biology and sustainability to solidify their understanding of scientific theories. The interdisciplinary nature of aquaponics may make it an appealing tool for science education, yet that same aspect may also make an aquaponics system challenging to implement and manage. Given this paradox, this exploratory research assessed challenges and solutions facing aquaponics in education with a focus on implementation. In-depth interview data were collected through phone interviews with educators (N = 10) who currently, or had in the past five years, used an aquaponics system in educational settings in North America. Participants reported two challenges: technical difficulties as a result of the nature of aquaponics and restrictions as a result of school settings. Solutions given by participants were physical aquaponics system modifications and the development of community connections and support, passion for aquaponics and expertise. These findings will help educators manage their expectations for aquaponics while establishing objectives for their individual settings.

AB  - Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe risk their competitiveness if they fail to embrace digitalization. Indeed, SMEs are aware of the need to digitalize--more than one in two SMEs are concerned that they may lose competitiveness if they do not adopt new digital technologies. However, a key obstacle is related with decision-makers' lack of awareness concerning digital technologies potential and implications. Some decision-makers renounce digital transition simply because they do not understand how it can be incorporated into the business. Take into account this common reality, especially among SMEs, this research project intends to identify the skills and subjects that need to be addressed and suggests the educational methodology and implementation strategy capable of maximizing its success. Therefore, and supported by a focused group research methodology, an innovative training program, oriented to decision-makers, was designed and implemented. The program was conceived based on a self-directed learning methodology, combining both asynchronous lecture/expositive and active training methodologies, strongly based on state-of-the-art knowledge and supported by reference cases and real applications. It is intended that the trainees/participants become familiar with a comprehensive set of concepts, principles, methodologies, and tools, capable of significantly enhancing decision-making capability at both strategic and tactical level. The proposed programme with a multidisciplinary scope explores different thematic chapters (self-contained) as well as cross-cutting thematic disciplines, oriented to the Industry 4.0 and digital transformation paradigm. Topics related with Digital Maturity Assessment, Smart Factories and Flexible Production Systems, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence for Smarter Decision-Making in Industry and Smart Materials and Products, as well as new production processes for new business models. Each thematic chapter in turn is structured around a variable set of elementary modules and includes examples and case studies to illustrate the selected topics. A teaching-learning methodology centered on an online platform is proposed, having as a central element, a collection of videos complemented by a set of handouts that organize the set of key messages and take-ways associated with each module. In this paper, we present the design and practice of this training course specifically oriented to decision-makers in SME.

AB  - As a newcomer, the philosophical basis of systems biology seems intuitive and appealing, the underlying philosophy being that the whole of a living system cannot be completely understood by the study of its individual parts. Yet answers to the questions "What is systems biology?" and "What constitutes a systems biology approach in 2016?" are somewhat more elusive. This seems to be due largely to the diversity of disciplines involved and the varying emphasis placed on the computational modeling and experimental aspects of systems biology. As such, the education of systems biology would benefit from multidisciplinary collaboration with both instructors and students from a range of disciplines within the same course. This essay is the personal reflection of a graduate student trying to get an introductory overview of the field of systems biology and some thoughts about effective education of systems biology.

AB  - This paper discusses the findings of a search for the intellectual tools used by Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) in his chemistry, education, and theology documents. Priestley's enquiring democratic view of knowledge was applicable in all three areas and constitutes a significant part of his lifework. Current epistemological issues in science education are examined from the point of view of the nature of theory and experiment as observed in Priestley's writings and as espoused in modern philosophy of science. Science and religious faith issues in the context of science education are examined from the point of view of one's understanding of sacred texts, and the suggestion is made that a Priestleyan model of "the liberty to think for oneself" and "to hold knowledge with humility and virtue" could prove helpful in dealing with the known divergent opinions in relation to science, education, and religion.

AB  - The rapid evolution of System-on-Chip (SoC) challenges academic curricula to keep pace with multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary system thinking. This paper presents a curricular prototype that cuts across artificial course boundaries and provides a meaningful exploration of diverse facets of SoC design. Specifically, experimental contents of a digital flow SoC product design--a simplified Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/Internet Protocol (IP) stack--are systematically developed and implemented in the series of courses that comprise the Digital Design track of the Rowan Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) curriculum. The System-on-Chip project and its progressively more complex laboratory modules are described and discussed. Its implementation in the existing ECE curriculum is also presented along with the assessment results. (Contains 9 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - Fostering interdisciplinary learning in biology will require significant changes in the way one teaches science to K-12 students. The perspective on interdisciplinary biology teaching and learning in this essay is based on the author's experiences as a former research cell biologist, high school science teacher, and developer of secondary science curricula and teacher professional development programs used in a variety of school districts nationwide. On the basis of these experiences, the author is enthusiastic about the importance of preparing students for the interdisciplinary nature of modern biology, yet concerned about the challenges faced by teachers and school districts as they move toward a modern curriculum. Transforming interdisciplinary biology teaching at the secondary level must include changes in curriculum, instruction, assessments, and teacher professional development in order to support teaching for conceptual understanding and for making cross-disciplinary connections. To prepare students for the nature of modern biology, biology educators must provide them with frequent opportunities to engage in studying interdisciplinary scientific questions or problems. Students will need sufficient time and support to explore, analyze, and reflect on the contributions of various disciplines to advances in modern biology.

AB  - Art and Technology is an interdisciplinary art program at AAU that involves knowledge and methods ranging from the humanities, to engineering sciences. Art and Technology is a hybrid program that combines science and technology with the artistic imagination, and thus combines both artistic and academic methodologies. The main question this paper addresses is: "What is a problem in art?" The paper discusses what defines a problem as in the PBL Aalborg Model, in the field of Art and Technology, by analysing the problem formulations of the 2017 BA projects through Mogens Pahuus three types of problem orientation. The paper discusses the potentials and pitfalls of PBL in art and technology education.

AB  - The history of science has a unique value to teaching, and textbooks play an important role in permeating the history of science in science courses. This study aims to compare the presentation of history of science in two versions of high school physics textbooks in China. We selected the 2019 edition of the national and local textbooks as samples. The revised Leite's checklist is used to conduct statistics and comparative analysis on the history of science content in the two versions of textbooks, referred to as the PEP and Luke versions described in more detail in the paper. The results show that, in terms of the quantity and presentation of the history of science, the PEP version contains more history of science, while the Luke version presents the historical content more intuitively. In terms of the type and organization of the history of science, the Luke version describes scientists and the type of evolution in more detail. In the presentation of the history of science, both of the two versions of textbooks are mainly based on texts written by textbook authors, supplemented by pictures of scientists and instruments. In the description of the contexts of the history of science, both tend to use the scientific context to present the history of science. In terms of the status of the history of science content, it mostly acts as a fundamental role in the Luke version while plays a complementary one in the PEP version. As for the learning activities related to the history of science, both tend to set up normal-level activities. The two versions of textbooks are relatively poor in the internal consistency of the textbooks with respect to the historical information and interdisciplinary activity design. Only Compulsory Book 1 of PEP version has the content of history of science as bibliography, and both of the two versions of textbooks seldom have history of science books as its bibliography.

AB  - Researchers, administrators, and policy makers need valid and reliable information about teaching practices. The Postsecondary Instructional Practices Survey (PIPS) is designed to measure the instructional practices of postsecondary instructors from any discipline. The PIPS has 24 instructional practice statements and nine demographic questions. Users calculate PIPS scores by an intuitive proportion-based scoring convention. Factor analyses from 72 departments at four institutions (N = 891) support a 2- or 5-factor solution for the PIPS; both models include all 24 instructional practice items and have good model fit statistics. Factors in the 2-factor model include (a) instructor-centered practices, nine items; and (b) student-centered practices, 13 items. Factors in the 5-factor model include (a) student--student interactions, six items; (b) content delivery, four items; (c) formative assessment, five items; (d) student-content engagement, five items; and (e) summative assessment, four items. In this article, we describe our development and validation processes, provide scoring conventions and outputs for results, and describe wider applications of the instrument.

AB  - We are living in an increasingly diverse media landscape, with advertising a significant part of this. There appears to be unanimous agreement that the ability to critically examine and make rational decisions about advertising is indispensable for contemporary citizens. Students need to develop critical thinking skills in order to evaluate messages and facts drawn from advertisements in various media. They also need to be familiar with the hidden mechanisms used to create advertisements with the goal of subconsciously influencing consumers. Today, advertising for many products has strong scientific and technological components. However, learning both with and about advertising does not play a prominent role in the science education literature. To date, the use of advertising as educational content is found almost exclusively in the humanities and social sciences, especially language education. On the other hand, there is an extensive body of research on the effects of advertising on children, consumer socialization as well as marketing strategies aimed at young consumers. The results indicate that advertising has a strong impact on children's beliefs and perceptions which already starts at an early stage. Therefore, this paper attempts to analyse the potential use of and learning about advertising in science education. It reviews the available literature, not only from science education, but also from other domains, including non-science subjects, cross-curricular approaches as well as research on the use and effects of advertising in the public arena. The aim is to identify the potential roles advertising might play in the science classroom and to open up new directions for science education research and curriculum development.

AB  - This paper seeks to deconstruct the place of midwives as professionals using the novel interdisciplinary lens of the Place Model--an innovative analytical device which originated in education and has been previously applied to both teachers and teacher educators. The Place Model allows us to map the metaphorical professional landscape of the midwife and to consider how and where midwives are located in the combined context of two senses of place: in the sociological sense of public esteem and also the humanistic geography tradition of place as a cumulative process of professional learning. A range of exemplars will bring this map to life uncovering both the dystopias and potentially utopian places in which midwives find their various professional places in the world. The Model can be used to help student midwives to consider and take charge of their learning and status trajectories within the profession.

AB  - The modern world can be described as a globalized risk society. It is characterized by increasing complexity, unpredictable consequences of techno-scientific innovations and production, and its environmental consequences. Therefore, chemistry, just like many other knowledge areas, is in an ongoing process of "environmentalization." For example, green chemistry has emerged as a new chemical metadiscipline and movement. The philosophy of green chemistry was originally based on a suggestion of twelve principles for environment-friendly chemistry research and production. The present article problematizes limitations in green chemistry when it comes to education. It argues that the philosophy of green chemistry in the context of education needs to be extended with socio-critical perspectives to form educated professionals and citizens who are able to understand the complexity of the world, to make value-based decisions, and to become able to engage more thoroughly in democratic decision-making on sustainability issues. Different versions of sustainability-oriented science/chemistry education are discussed to sharpen a focus on the most complex type, which is "Bildung"-oriented, focusing emancipation and leading to eco-reflexive education. The term "eco-reflexive" is used for a problematizing stance towards the modern risk society, an understanding of the complexity of life and society and their interactions, and a responsibility for individual and collective actions towards socio-ecojustice and global sustainability. The philosophical foundation and characteristics of eco-reflexive science education are sketched on in the article.

AB  - Scientific undergraduate research in higher education often yields positive outcomes for student and faculty member participants alike, with underrepresented students often showing even more substantial gains (academic, professional, and personal) as a result of the experience. Significant success can be realized when involving deaf and hard-of-hearing (d/hh) undergraduate students, who are also vastly underrepresented in the sciences, in interdisciplinary research projects. Even d/hh Associate degree level students and those in the first two years of their postsecondary careers can contribute to, and benefit from, the research process when faculty mentors properly plan/design projects. We discuss strategies, including the dissemination/communication of research results, for involving these students in research groups with different communication dynamics and share both findings of our research program and examples of successful chemical and biological research projects that have involved d/hh undergraduate students. We hope to stimulate a renewed interest in encouraging diversity and involving students with disabilities into higher education research experiences globally and across multiple scientific disciplines, thus strengthening the education and career pipeline of these students.

AB  - Global efforts to prepare young developing minds for solving current and future challenges of climate change have advocated interdisciplinary, issues-based instructional approaches in order to transform traditional models of science education as delivering conceptual facts (UNESCO, 2014). This study is an exploration of the online interactions in an international social network of high school students residing in Norway, China, New Zealand and the United States (N=141). Students participated in classroom-based and asynchronous online discussions about adapted versions of seminal scientific studies with facilitative support from seven scientists across various fields. Grounded in a language-in-use frame for investigating facilitation and demonstrations of problem-based and evidence-based reasoning (Kelly & Chen, 1999), we traced the varied questions, assertions, and evidentiary sources within student-led online discussions. We found that questions from scientific experts in the form of unconstrained, open-ended invitations for exploration were followed by students' acknowledgement and consideration of complex and, at times, conflicting sociopolitical and economic positions about climate change issues. These findings suggest that broadening science classroom discussions to include socially relevant, unsolved issues like climate change could open potential entry points for a dialogic approach that fosters a scientific community in the classroom.

AB  - This article addressed the need for authentic interdisciplinary instruction. Authentic interdisciplinary instruction is defined as a learning activity that simultaneously improves student performance related to grade-level standards in two or more disciplines (e.g., science and physical education). The process described for creating authentic interdisciplinary lessons included: (1) get a list of grade level standards from all disciplines; (2) compare the list of standards to the physical education standards at the same grade level; (3) look for related standards (commonalities) from two or more disciplines; and (4) create interdisciplinary lessons that address these standards. Interdisciplinary instruction can help teachers provide students with an enjoyable, rich, and motivational learning environment (Leppo & Davis, 2005).

AB  - To promote undergraduate education reform, teaching professional development (TPD) efforts aim to encourage instructors to adopt evidence-based practices. However, many instructors do not attend TPD. There may be many reasons for this, including low intrinsic motivation to participate in TPD. Psychologists have dealt with motivational barriers in educational contexts using psychosocial interventions, brief activities that draw on a rich history of psychological research to subtly alter key, self-reinforcing psychological processes to yield long-term intrinsic motivation and behavioral changes. Psychosocial interventions, for example, have been used to alter students' noncognitive attitudes and beliefs, such as attributions and mindset, which positively influence students' motivation and academic performance. Here, we propose that insights from research on psychosocial interventions may be leveraged to design interventions that will increase instructors' motivation to participate in TPD, thus enhancing existing pedagogical reform efforts. We discuss psychological principles and "best practices" underlying effective psychosocial interventions that could guide the development of interventions to increase instructors' motivation to attend TPD. We encourage new interdisciplinary research collaborations to explore the potential of these interventions, which could be a new approach to mitigating at least one barrier to undergraduate education reform.

AB  - Our current multicultural societies require that education addresses diversity and promotes cultural awareness and intercultural learning. Mathematics and science education can also contribute to this aspect of citizenship education and create a culture of belonging for all students. Professional development that integrates intercultural learning with educational practices is still uncommon in the field of science and mathematics teacher preparation and support. This study explores the possibilities to support science and mathematics teachers in implementing intercultural learning through a professional development course. The course was developed in a European setting, based on a theoretical analysis, and tried out with 319 teachers from six participating countries. The impact of the course on teachers' take up of intercultural learning was measured with a pre-post questionnaire. We found that the course strengthened teachers' self-efficacy beliefs and extended their teaching practices with opportunities created by cultural diversity among their students or in their subjects. In addition to that, teachers' self-efficacy beliefs and the perceived cultural diversity in class appeared to be influencing factors for teachers' practices. Based on our findings we recommend that the combination of intercultural learning with educational practices of mathematics and science might be a suitable gateway to provide new intercultural learning opportunities for students.

AB  - Computing education in schools faces several problems, such as a lack of computing teachers and time in an already overloaded curriculum. A solution can be a multidisciplinary approach, integrating the teaching of computing within other subjects, creating the need to motivate teachers from other disciplines to teach computing in middle school. Therefore, the motivation and training of in-service teachers becomes crucial, as they need to have computing content and technological knowledge as well as pedagogical content knowledge. Yet, so far there exist very few training programs. Thus, as part of a comprehensive outreach program, we present a study on a one-day taster workshop for middle school teachers on physical computing education. Participants learn computer programming practice and computational thinking by programming an interactive robot. The workshop also approaches pedagogical aspects for teaching computing and technical issues regarding the installation and preparation of the required hardware/software. Preliminary results of its application with public school teachers in Florianopolis/Brazil are positive, motivating the majority of participants to introduce computing into their classes. However, our results also highlight that in order to enable teacher to apply the workshops effectively, longer training courses and ongoing support is required.

AB  - Mercer University School of Medicine utilizes a problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum for educating medical students in the basic clinical sciences. In 2014, an adjustment was piloted that enabled PBL cases to align with their corresponding cadaver dissection that reviewed the content of anatomy contained in the PBL cases. Faculty had the option of giving PBL cases in sequence with the cadaveric dissection schedule (sequential group) or maintaining PBL cases out of sequence with dissections (traditional group). During this adjustment, students' academic performances were compared. Students' perception of their own preparedness for cadaveric dissection, their perceived utility of the cadaver dissections, and free-response comments were solicited via an online survey. There were no statistically significant differences when comparing student mean examination score values between the sequential and traditional groups on both multidisciplinary examinations (79.39 ± 7.63 vs. 79.88 ± 7.31, P = 0.738) and gross anatomy questions alone (78.15 ± 10.31 vs. 79.98 ± 9.31, P = 0.314). A statistically significant difference was found between the sequential group's and traditional group's (63% vs. 29%; P = 0.005) self-perceived preparedness for cadaveric dissections in the 2017 class. Analysis of free-response comments found that students in the traditional group believed their performance in PBL group, participation in PBL group and examination performance was adversely affected when compared to students with the sequential schedule. This study provides evidence that cadaveric dissections scheduled in sequence with PBL cases can lead to increased student self-confidence with learning anatomy but may not lead to improved examination scores.

AB  - Undergraduate research experiences (UREs) are part of an expanding toolkit of experiential learning experiences that can help students engage with the practices and processes of STEM. Civic engagement is another type of experiential learning experience that can offer students meaningful interactions in the wider community, thus leading to greater relevance and application of their work. Research studies suggest that both civic engagement and UREs are high-impact practices. Much of the work to date on experiential learning has been discipline based. This may be due to challenges in getting faculty members from different disciplines to work together, or because of issues with infrastructure, budget policies, credit hours, incentives, and/or the reward systems in higher education. This paper aims to help readers better understand the potential for UREs that integrate civic engagement to enhance learning. To illustrate how the obstacles might be surmounted, an example of an interdisciplinary URE that is coupled with civic engagement is provided.

AB  - In order to create professional development experiences, curriculum materials, and policies that support elementary school teachers to embed computational thinking (CT) in their teaching, researchers and teacher educators must understand ways teachers see CT as connecting to their classroom practices. We interviewed 12 elementary school teachers, probing their understanding six components of CT (abstraction, algorithmic thinking, automation, debugging, decomposition, and generalization) and how those components relate to their math and science teaching. Results suggested that teachers saw stronger connections between CT and their mathematics instruction than between CT and their science instruction. We also found that teachers draw upon their existing knowledge of CT-related terminology to make connections to their math and science instruction that could be leveraged in professional development. Teachers were, however, concerned about bringing CT into teaching due to limited class time and the difficulties of addressing high level CT thinking in developmentally appropriate ways. We discuss these results and their implications future research and the design of curriculum and professional development.

We provide insight into how interdisciplinary faculty may successfully collaborate given their different disciplinary backgrounds. We explore the importance of education research brokers, individuals credited with helping STEM faculty understand, respond to, and recognize the importance of education research and theory. In addition, we discuss the advantages of appointments of brokers within STEM versus Education Departments. We identify key characteristics that help build and sustain interdisciplinary collaboration and establish the critical roles of brokers at institutions that strive to improve education.

AB  - Project-based learning (PjBL--to distinguish from problem-based learning--PBL) has become a recurrent practice in K-12 classroom environments. As PjBL has become prominent in K-12 classrooms, it has also surfaced in post-secondary institutions. The purpose of this paper is to examine the research that has studied a variety of science, technology, engineering and mathematic (STEM) subjects using PjBL in post-secondary classrooms. Fourteen articles (including qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods) were included. Two tables and two figures are included. In this paper, theoretical backgrounds and key terms were identified, followed by a literature review discussing four themes: content knowledge, interdisciplinary skills, collaboration and skill development for future education and careers. Results suggested that there is a positive connection between content knowledge learning and PjBL in collaborative settings. However, some negative perceptions arose regarding teamwork situations. Interdisciplinary skills were achieved, but quite limited in post-secondary classrooms. PjBL and STEM were perceived to be important for future education and careers. Future research needs to be completed and institutional curriculum changes informed by the results of this research need to occur to further explore interdisciplinary courses and the use of PjBL.

AB  - A special topics course combining two relevant and contemporary themes (forensic DNA analysis and illicit drug detection) was developed to stimulate student enthusiasm and enhance understanding of forensic science. Building on the interest of popular television shows such as "CSI" and "Breaking Bad," this course connects essential concepts in biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, organic chemistry, and general chemistry with criminal justice studies to kindle student interest using the forensic science theme. Available to students in criminal justice or natural science majors, the forensic science theme is the focus as students participate in interdisciplinary activities and discussions while exploring fundamental principles used to solve crimes. Requiring critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, the collaboration of students of different academic focus leads to the debunking of myths surrounding both police and forensic scientists, while developing an awareness of how law enforcement and scientists work together in reality.

AB  - This paper describes a three-year curriculum innovation project on teaching about climate change. The innovation for this study focused on a socio-critical approach towards teaching climate change in four different teaching domains (biology, chemistry, physics and politics). The teaching itself explicitly aimed at general educational objectives, i.e., fostering students' communication and evaluation abilities as essential components for preparing young people for active participation in society. Participatory Action Research has been used as a collaborative strategy of cyclical curriculum innovation and research. Using past experiences and selected results from accompanying research, this project and its methodology will be reflected upon from the viewpoint of the chemistry group taking part in the project. Core issues reflected upon include how the project contributed to the creation of feasible curriculum materials, how it led to innovative structures in practice, and whether it supported experienced teachers' ongoing professional development. General considerations for the process of curriculum innovation will also be derived.

AB  - Quality STEM teacher education is predicated on teacher educators who are well-equipped to design learning experiences, provide feedback, guide the development of teachers across their career span, and conduct rigorous research to advance education theory and praxis. While numerous models and approaches to professional development for teachers exist, few parallels can be drawn between the professional development of teachers and teacher educators (Loughran, 2014). To support the multi-faceted identity (trans)formation of STEM teacher educators, self-directed learning opportunities can help bridge knowledge and practice, enhance productive collaboration, and support efforts to negotiate multiple and conflicting agendas (Goodwin & Kosnik, 2013). The purpose of this empirical study was to explore the identity (trans)formation of teacher educators participating in a long-term interdisciplinary STEM-based Community of Practice (CoP; Wenger, 1998), which began in 2012. An analysis of our experiences through the figured worlds lens informs how a CoP can impact curricular approaches and teacher PD, imploring members to move through their comfort zones into innovative spaces. We conclude with suggestions for our STEM teacher educator colleagues who seek opportunities to challenge their own positions and best support preservice and in-service STEM teachers in a way that allows them to model for their students the value of community.

AB  - Health professions education is that part of the education system which applies educational philosophy, theory, principles and practice in a complex relationship with busy clinical services, where education is not the primary role. While the goals are clear--to produce the health workforce that society needs to improve health outcomes--both education and healthcare systems continue to evolve concurrently amidst changes in knowledge, skills, population demographics and social contracts. In observing a significant anniversary of this journal, which sits at the junction of education and healthcare systems, it is appropriate to reflect on how the relationship is evolving. Health professions educators must listen to the voices of regulators, employers, students and patients when adapting to new service delivery models that emerge in response to pressures for change. The recent COVID-19 pandemic is one example of disruptive change, but other factors, such as population pressures and climate change, can also drive innovations that result in lasting change. Emerging technology may act as either a servant of change or a disruptor. There is a pressing need for interdisciplinary research that develops a theory and evidence base to strengthen sustainability of change.

AB  - Learner-centered blended learning approaches, such as Knowledge Creation, emphasize the self-organizing characteristic of thought and action, and value the students' autonomy and self-regulation during the engagement in collaborative learning tasks. In blended contexts, the students need to organize their learning paths within a complex environment, including multiple online and offline learning spaces. This process of self-organization during courses based on the Knowledge Creation approach is currently an overlooked topic of research. The present case study is aimed at addressing this research gap by providing an in-depth understanding of the collaborative self-organization of a group of five undergraduate students participating in an interdisciplinary media design course. The course was designed according to the Knowledge Creation approach and was carried out before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dialogical theory of the chronotope and the theory of cultural models constitute the main theoretical tools for the research. We used qualitative methods inspired by ethnography, including participant observation, in addition to the collection and analysis of audio-visual records, stimulated recall interviews, and learning diaries completed by the students. The findings show that the group self-organization changed across different phases of the collaborative task and involved the development of specific practices of self-organization. Cultural models associated with the task contributed to determine the students' choices related to self-organization.

AB  - Digital competence and programming are actively highlighted areas in education worldwide. They are becoming part of curricula all over the world, including the Swedish elementary school curriculum, Children are expected to develop "computational thinking" through programming activities, mainly in mathematics--which are supposed to be based on both proven experience and scientific grounds. Both are lacking in the lower grades of elementary school. This article gives unique insight into pupils' learning during the first programming lessons based on a group of Swedish pupils' experiences when entering school. The goal of the article is to inform education policy and practice. The large interdisciplinary, longitudinal research project studies approximately 1500 students aged 6-16 and their teachers over three years, using video documentation, questionnaires, and focus group interviews. This article reports on empirical data collected during the first year in one class with 30 pupils aged 6-7 years. The social semiotic, multimodal theoretical framework "Design for Learning" is used to investigate potential "signs of learning" in pupils' multimodal "representations" when they, for example, use block programming in the primary and "secondary transformation unit." We show that young pupils have positive attitudes to programming and high self-efficacy, and that pupils' signs of learning in programming are multimodal and often visible in social interactions.

AB  - As is the worldwide trend, scientists in China face strong and increasing pressure to publish their research in international peer-reviewed journals written in English. There is an acute need for graduate students to develop the required language skills alongside their scientific expertise, in spite of the distinct division currently existing between English teaching and the other disciplines. Researchers in the workplace also need ongoing training, presenting a complex challenge for the sector. We present an analysis of data gathered as we have introduced, in Chinese science- and English teaching-based contexts, an approach to the development of international publishing capacity entitled CIPSE--Collaborative Interdisciplinary Publication Skills Education. This approach involves scientists and English language specialists working together on education programs adapted to fit local contextual constraints, and builds on collaborative approaches used extensively in ESP contexts elsewhere. Our analysis suggests some possible components of the multi-faceted strategy set that will clearly be required to address the challenges. We argue for changes to the teaching of English to research students in the sciences, including the development of a strong research base incorporating corpus linguistics, English for Specific Purposes pedagogy and interdisciplinary collaborative practice.

AB  - This study examines teachers' initial conceptions of an integrated STEM-PBL approach and their perceptions of what facilitates or hinders implementation in their schools. This study took place within the first year of a three-year STEM Professional Development (PD) program for middle school math, science and English language arts teachers. The two primary PD components were a week-long, summer institute and a school-year cross-curricular unit planning that included a lesson-study component. Qualitative methods were used to analyze teacher responses from PD evaluations, teacher reflections, interviews and program artifacts. The study provides insight into the feasibility of an integrated STEM-PBL model. The study concludes with implications for practice and a discussion of how future interdisciplinary professional development can be conceptualized.

AB  - Background: STEM educational reform encourages a transition from instructor-centered passive learning environments to student-centered, active learning environments. Instructors adopting these changes incorporate research-validated teaching practices that improve student learning. Professional development that trains faculty to implement instructional reforms plays a key role in supporting this transition. The most effective professional development experiences are those that not only help an instructor redesign a course, but that also result in a permanent realignment of the teaching beliefs of participating instructors. Effective professional development features authentic, rigorous experiences of sufficient duration. We investigated changes in the teaching beliefs of college faculty resulting from their participation in the Interdisciplinary Teaching about the Earth for a Sustainable Future (InTeGrate) project that guided them in the development of reformed instructional materials for introductory college science courses. A convergent parallel mixed methods design was employed using the Teacher Belief Interview, the Beliefs About Reformed Science Teaching and Learning survey, and participants' reflections on their experience to characterize pedagogical beliefs at different stages of their professional development. Results: Qualitative and quantitative data show a congruent change toward reformed pedagogical beliefs for the majority of participants. The majority of participants' Teacher Belief Interview (TBI) scores improved toward more student-centered pedagogical beliefs. Instructors who began with the most traditional pedagogical beliefs showed the greatest gains. Interview data and participants' reflections aligned with the characteristics of effective professional development. Merged results suggest that the most significant changes occurred in areas strongly influenced by situational classroom factors. Conclusions: The process of materials development employed in the InTeGrate project is comprised of rigorous, authentic, and collaborative experiences continued over a sufficient duration. Incorporating these characteristics in to a professional development program on a variety of scales can help promote the long-term adoption of reformed teaching strategies. Collaboration among geoscience professionals was one of the predominant drivers for change. Consequently, this research provides insight for the development of future professional development opportunities seeking to better prepare instructors to implement reformed instructional strategies in their classrooms.

AB  - This article analyses Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in chemistry by reviewing existing challenges and future possibilities on the levels of the teacher and the student. Pedagogical frameworks that are found eligible in practice are reviewed. Lesson themes that are suitable for implementing socioscientific issues (SSI) related to ESD into basic chemistry education at schools are discussed. Based on this analysis, three new demonstrative pedagogical models for ESD in chemistry are presented to help guide the work of teachers. The models draw on an interdisciplinary reading of research in the field of SSI-based science education, sustainability science, green chemistry and environmental education. The current state of ESD in Finnish chemistry education is used as an example case throughout the article. Two tasks where future development is required were recognised. The first task concerns supporting chemistry teachers in overcoming the challenges with SSI and ESD they face in their work. The second task is to ensure that students are more often provided with more relevant and flexible chemistry content and studying methods.

AB  - This study aimed to elicit middle school preservice mathematics teachers' self-reported web of knowledge recalled in generating mathematically rich and contextually realistic problems. We designed this study as multi-tier design research incorporated into two teacher education courses in which 40 preservice teachers enrolled in total. Preservice teachers worked in small groups and recorded the characteristics of mathematically rich and contextually realistic problems. They were also asked to produce webs of knowledge recalled in this process. Preservice teachers' individual reflection papers, audio records of their group discussions and interviews were analyzed to understand how different types of knowledge in their web of knowledge function in relation to the mathematical richness and contextual realness aspects of the problems. The findings indicated that preservice teachers could identify various characteristics for mathematical richness and contextual realistic aspects of the problems. In relation to those characteristics, the preservice teachers' self-reported web of knowledge produced three core knowledge types for ensuring mathematical richness (i.e., knowledge of content, curriculum, and pedagogy) and two aspects of realistic contexts (i.e., real life knowledge and interdisciplinary knowledge). Furthermore, although they included common knowledge types, the webs of knowledge were in different shapes and indicated various relationships (i.e., hierarchical, categorical, influential, and holistic.). Considering the various relations indicated by the webs of knowledge, we claimed that teachers needed an interconnected knowledge base for mathematically rich and contextually realistic problems, the implications of which we discussed for mathematics teacher education.

AB  - This article explores the ways in which the quantitative and qualitative tools used by risk managers can help students think critically about issues. In particular, it identifies some of the quantitative skills used for risk assessment that can be taught and used in mathematics and science classes. It also examines the qualitative knowledge of governance structures, primarily acquired in social studies classes, and how these can be applied in analyzing solutions to the complex issues of this century and our future. Examples are given of the application of these diverse skill sets to such controversial issues as the use of nuclear technology, disaster response, and preservation of the environment. An interdisciplinary approach to the teaching of controversial issues is encouraged.

AB  - A climate-literate population, capable of making informed decisions related to climate change, is of critical importance as society faces ever-increasing global temperatures and changes in the climate system. This project evaluates the effectiveness of a novel instructional approach that incorporates climate change science into a first-year undergraduate level writing course. Science content included in the course focuses on climate and global environmental change and how it relates to society, policy, and economics. The multidisciplinary nature of the course material allows the climate change science content to be addressed from different viewpoints and student perspectives. Student surveys and self-reflections indicate that fundamental climate change science concepts and content can be taught in the context of a nonscience course focused on writing. Selfreflections reveal that 50% of students reported new or continuing interest in science and climate science, 35% did not explicitly mention their attitude toward science, 10% remained uninterested, and 5% lost interest as a result of participating in the pilot course. To produce climate literate citizens, new methods such as the pilot course described in this study, can be used to incorporate the science of climate change into nonscience

AB  - The conceptual positions of professional training of Masters in International Relations in Great Britain have been studied. On the basis of literary and documentary sources the basic concepts laid into contemporary theories of constructivism and cognitivism, theory of development and self-realisation of creative personality on the basis of learner-centered learning, theories of intellectual, human and cultural capital, the idea of education, science and industry integration have been revealed. The importance of structural and functional organization of Master's professional training in the system of higher education on the principles of consistency, science, multiculturalism, interdisciplinarity and continuity has been highlighted. It has been emphasized that the concept of the rational choice theory and the study of career orientations that are parts of Master's professional image are very important for the professional training of Masters in International Relations. The new ideas of solving educational problems such as the openness of higher education, participation, continuous education, the advanced development of higher education have been analyzed. The basic directions of the system development of Masters in International Relations' professional training, including education focus on the problems of post-industrial civilization, the development of man's creative abilities; taking into account the status and prognosis of the economy, labour market, information technology development, the objective needs of updating professional education and learning have been defined.

AB  - In most middle schools, learning is segregated by discipline. Yet interdisciplinary approaches have been shown to cultivate creative thinking, support problem solving, and develop interest while supporting knowledge gains (NAE & NRC in STEM Integration in K-12 Education: Status, Prospects, and an Agenda for Research. National Academies Press, Washington, 2014). The Designing Biomimetic Robots project emphasizes problem-based learning to integrate engineering, science, and computational thinking (CT). During a 3 to 4-week unit, students study the natural world to learn how animals accomplish different tasks, then design a robot inspired by what they learned. The project engages students in science, engineering, and CT practices. Over the course of a 3-year project, we used a design-based research approach to: (1) identify and describe strategies and challenges that emerge from integrated curriculum design, (2) explicate how a balance of integrated disciplines can provide opportunities for student participation in science, engineering, and CT practices, and (3) explore how a technology design task can support students' participation in integrated learning. Data from three focal groups (one from each year of the project) suggest that a focused design task, supported by explicit and targeted supports for science, CT, and engineering practices, led to a student technology design process that was driven by disciplinary understanding. This work highlights the importance of drawing out and prioritizing alignments between disciplines (Barber in Educ Des, 2(8), 2015), to enable integrated learning. Additionally, this work demonstrates how a technology design task can support student learning across disciplines, and how engaging in CT practices can further help students draw these connections.

AB  - National calls to transform undergraduate classrooms highlight the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). As biologists, we use principles from chemistry and physics to make sense of the natural world. One might assume that scientists, regardless of discipline, use similar principles, resources, and reasoning to explain crosscutting phenomena. However, the context of complex natural systems can profoundly impact the knowledge activated. In this study, we used the theoretical lens of framing to explore how experts from different disciplines reasoned about a crosscutting phenomenon. Using interviews conducted with faculty (n = 10) in biology, physics, and engineering, we used isomorphic tasks to explore the impact of item context features (i.e., blood or water) on how faculty framed and reasoned about fluid dynamics, a crosscutting concept. While faculty were internally consistent in their reasoning across prompts, biology experts framed fluid dynamics problems differently than experts in physics and engineering and, as a result, used different principles and resources to reach different conclusions. These results have several implications for undergraduate learners who encounter these cross-disciplinary topics in all of their STEM courses. If each curriculum expects students to develop different reasoning strategies, students may struggle to build a coherent, transferable understanding of crosscutting phenomena.

AB  - Quality of science instruction is crucial at the college level due to the increasing demand of scientific literacy. Development of science education has been examined in this article through both contextual and comparative angles of college teaching. Different approaches have been analyzed to merge interdisciplinary efforts that articulate both artistic and scientific natures for the benefit of various constituencies. Suggestions have been provided to enhance the scholarship of science education as a subject within natural science departments. Similar to the industry partnership between R&D and customer service sectors, effective collaborations between scientists and science educators can facilitate recognition of the science education subject across the campuses of higher learning.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of how lecturers respond to students with disabilities, the initial question being: do lecturers aid or hinder students? Findings pertain to a broader research project being developed by a multidisciplinary team employing a non-usual research methodology in higher education (HE) research and students with disabilities: biographical-narrative methodology. The general aim is to analyse--by listening to the students themselves--barriers and support identified as affecting access, academic performance and overall perception of the HE experience. The present paper analyses lecturer-centered data to focus specifically on one of the objectives of our research project: the role that lecturers play in the inclusive education of students with disabilities. Unlike other international research, this article explores the barriers and support differentiating between five fields of knowledge: health sciences, experimental sciences, social sciences (law and education), engineering and technology and humanities. Findings are organized in four topic areas: lecturer attitudes, practices in the classroom, curricular adaptations and faculty training. Key findings are discussed in the conclusions section, together with a discussion of contributions made by earlier studies.

AB  - Published evaluations of career preparation of alumni from long-standing postdoctoral fellowship programs in the biomedical sciences are limited and often focus on quantitative analysis of data from extant publicly available sources. Qualitative methods provide the opportunity to gather robust information about specific program elements from structured postdoctoral training programs and the influence of this training on subsequent career paths of alumni. In-depth interviews with a subset of the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Prevention Fellowship Program (CPFP) alumni (n = 27), representing more than 25 years of the program's history and multiple career sectors, were conducted to assess alumni reflections on the training environment and career preparation during their time in the CPFP. NVivo software was used to analyze data and identify major themes. Four main themes emerged from these interviews, including: the value of structured training curriculum, mentorship, transdisciplinary environment, and professional identity. Even when reflecting on training that occurred one to two decades earlier, alumni were able to highlight specific components of a structured postdoctoral training program as influencing their research and career trajectories. These results may have relevance for those interested in assessing how postdoctoral training can influence fellows throughout their careers and understanding salient features of structured programs.

AB  - Socio-scientific issues should be considered in the course of students' formal education in science as one of the ways in which science education ought to be connected to the goals of sustainable development. Approaches to education in science still perpetuate a way of thinking that is incommensurable with preparing learners to develop the understandings and skills requisite for active participation in an uncertain and complex world. In addition, uptake of science is declining worldwide, poverty is deepening, and environmental degradation is worsening. We argue herein that finding ways to link science education to issues of sustainable development could provide the basis for making science more relevant to learners, as well as better prepare learners for active participation in society. We raise the question: How can science education be more relevant, thereby enabling learners to deal with complex everyday issues and participate in decision-making oriented toward the goals of sustainable development? Drawing on experiences of interdisciplinary dialogue, we illustrate how reformulating the agenda in science education, such that it is oriented toward sustainable development, offers the basis for relevant teaching and learning vis-à-vis the engagement of learners in active learning processes.

AB  - A small undergraduate liberal arts college explored a model, grounded in the literature, to develop a shared vision for its science and math general education curriculum that focuses on scientific literacy skills. This process has allowed us to produce shared general education learning goals across our eight science and math departments, conduct voluntary "best practices" workshops with a broad swath of faculty, and assess students' science and math attitudes and scientific literacy. It has also fostered interdisciplinary grant-writing teams to solicit external funding. The initial work was conducted at low cost to the institution. Our collaborative efforts positioned us to submit an NSF-IUSE grant, which was ultimately funded. Although the pace is often slower and the path more uncertain than individuals might desire, the results of this work suggest that teams of faculty and administrators can work together to align institutional priorities and produce genuine institutional change.

AB  - This study aims to investigate textbook tasks in the Norwegian school subject Natural sciences and the views of science that the tasks mediate to the pupils. Natural science is an interdisciplinary subject taught in Years 1-11 that includes chemistry, physics, biology and parts of the geosciences. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of 2,927 tasks from three Year-11 textbooks. The results showed that most of the tasks in all three textbooks were closed and asked the pupils to reproduce facts from the textbook or other information sources. However, findings also indicated that there are differences between and within the different chapters of the textbooks. In the topics that include socio-scientific issues, the tasks are more open for the pupils to both explore and evaluate evidence. Furthermore, all the three books have an introductory chapter focusing on scientific methodology, and the tasks in this chapter are much more diverse than in the remaining chapters. It therefore seems that the aim of the textbooks is to shed light on the nature of science, but the tasks embedded in the textbooks do not support scientific inquiry and perpetuate the traditional approach of asking learners to provide already determined answers to scientific issues.

AB  - Polar research plays a vital role in developing our understanding of Earth's climate system. It is intrinsically interdisciplinary, lending itself to integration into existing undergraduate courses. Here we explore introducing undergraduates to polar research through computational guided inquiry (CGI) modules taught in a variety of courses and disciplines. Students apply course disciplinary techniques to analysis of polar data or research, in the context of climate change, by working through educational modules that include spreadsheets (Excel[superscript TM]) or interactive computer programing (Python in a Jupyter Notebook), over a few class or lab periods. The goals of this exploratory curriculum project are to determine instructor perceptions of effectiveness of the educational modules for teaching preexisting disciplinary course objectives, as well as student perceptions of enjoyment and learning. Evaluation consisted of a student questionnaire and interviews with instructors by an external evaluator. Students and instructors overall reported positive experiences with the modules, highlighted the importance of polar data and climate literacy, and noted increases in student understanding of course learning goals and comfort with the computational tools. Professors further reported that students found the modules motivating, fun and engaging. Taken together, this suggests that the modules are an effective means of bringing polar research into undergraduate classrooms while satisfying instructor goals for course learning objectives. Lessons learned include the importance of providing material such as videos to help transition to the topics of polar research and climate change and of supporting widely varying computational fluency.

AB  - Integrating interdisciplinary social studies topics and social responsibility concepts into a business education class can be meaningful for student learning. The discipline of social studies includes multiple areas such as economics, history, sociology, and anthropology. Social responsibility in a business sense means that companies are concerned with the communities in which they operate beyond making a profit. Social responsibility has recently been emphasized as a way to teach students about how their actions can affect society. Microfinance is an example of social responsibility in which individuals across the world can loan money to struggling entrepreneurs in poor countries. Microfinance lends itself well with social studies since it emphasizes how people live and work in other countries. This paper describes how social responsibility and social studies can be woven into an integrated project for an introductory computer applications class. The course and projects are described and they can be customized for use in a high school or post-secondary setting.

AB  - Scientific reasoning and aesthetics are not mutually exclusive disciplines, as scientists' achievements are based not only on cognitive ability, but also on creativity, imagination, and embodied thought through various experiences. With the aim of investigating the role of aesthetic experience in the learning processes involved in the integration of art, science, and technology, this study explored students' experience of creating interactive art, which is the combination of art, science, and technology, within the context of Korean STEAM education. The participants were 19 high school students majoring in art. Each student envisioned their own artwork and constantly held individual consultations on their ideas with technical, artistic, and science education experts. I visited and observed this project for nine months and collected various types of qualitative data, such as conversations between students and technical experts, individual interviews with students, interview with a teacher, and students' artefacts. These data are used to construct a case study to interpret the meaning of art high school students' experiences of interactive art creation from the perspective of aesthetics. Through this learning experience, students were able to recognise the limitations of their thoughts and transform their ideas through the application of new scientific knowledge and skills.

AB  - Spatial reasoning is a valuable cognitive tool which enables navigation of the body in relation to other objects in space, permits deconstruction of dimensional forms, allows reconstruction of two-dimensional representations into three-dimensional objects, and facilitates diagramming of processes or concepts. A considerable body of work has suggested that these skills are particularly important for success in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields (reviewed in Wai, Lubinski, & Benbow, "Journal of Educational Psychology" 101: 817-835, 2009); however, much of this data has been derived from studies with relatively narrow populations in terms of participant sex, race, academic ability, or socioeconomic condition and very few of these studies have attempted spatial reasoning training from a diversity of academic disciplines. The current study was designed to assess the influence of a week-long, academically interdisciplinary spatial reasoning Bootcamp on a small, diverse group of female participants' spatial reasoning abilities and to determine if Participants' subsequent performance in organic chemistry and physics coursework differed from that of a Match (non-Bootcamp participant) Control group. The data indicate that Bootcamp participants significantly improved their scores in some commonly accepted measures of spatial reasoning abilities and that Bootcamp participants' final grades in organic chemistry, but not physics, were significantly higher than the Match Control group. The data suggest that intentional programming to improve student spatial reasoning abilities can influence short-term spatial skill performance that may translate into improved success in certain types of subsequent coursework.

AB  - There is a growing need for STEAM-based (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) knowledge and skills across a wide range of professions (Brazell 2013). Yet students often fail to see the usefulness of mathematics beyond the classroom (Kloosterman, Raymond, and Emenaker 1996), and they do not regularly make connections between mathematics and other fields (Kleiman 1991). Further, many students determine that mathematics is only for certain types of people and decide against pursuing advanced studies (Boaler and Greeno 2000). To make careers in STEAM fields tangible and accessible to their students, the authors of this article describe a lesson they developed to examine the multidisciplinary nature of game design and the role of mathematical reasoning in the process.

AB  - This case explores the complexity and dilemmas that faculty and academic administrators at Southwestern University (SU) encountered as they engaged in the development and establishment of a partnership with the local city's school districts. The partnership--carried at SU's College of Science but funded and based through a university-based agency--aimed to prepare math and science educators to better respond to the increasing pressure of improving student achievement in those subject areas. The complications and dilemmas that the math and science partnership encountered are traced and made visible as its establishment coincides with a period of institutional changes at SU. The changes involve the university's redefinition of its mission and goals including an institutional shift from a focus on teaching to one on research. The shift brought into stark relief a long-standing tension between two cherished but unequally valued academic practices: disciplinary (or basic) scholarship versus transdisciplinary (educational or applied) scholarship. Thus, set against the backdrop of institutional change and the resulting unstable institutional environment, the College of Science faculty who were part of the math and science partnership were confronted with an irreducible task: to work to reconcile the traditions and expectations of their department's disciplinary orientations that privileged disciplined based scholarship with the institutional commitment acquired through the partnership expecting a more transdisciplinary, applied educational scholarship. What follows describes how faculty and academic administrators navigated through this complex institutional tension and context, the dilemmas they confronted, and some of the outcomes that resulted.

AB  - This paper gives the rationale and a draft outline for a framework for education to teach epistemic insight into schools in England. The motivation to research and propose a strategy to teach and assess epistemic insight followed research that investigated how students and teachers in primary and secondary schools respond to "big questions" about the nature of reality and human personhood. The research revealed that there are pressures in schools that dampen students' expressed curiosity in these types of questions and limit their developing epistemic insight into how science, religion and the wider humanities relate. These findings prompted the construction of a "framework for education" for students aged 5-16 designed to encourage students' expressed interest in "big questions" and develop their understanding of the ways that science interacts with other ways of knowing. The centrepiece of the framework is a sequence of learning objectives for epistemic insight, organised into three categories. The categories are, firstly, the nature of science in real world contexts and multidisciplinary arenas; secondly, ways of knowing and how they interact; and thirdly, the relationships between science and religion. Our current version of the Framework is constructed to respond to the way that teaching is organised in England. The key principles and many of the activities could be adopted and tailored to work in many other countries.

AB  - The use of collaborative problem solving within mathematics education is imperative in this day and age of integrative science. The formation of interdisciplinary teams of mathematicians and scientists to investigate crucial problems is on the rise, as greater insight can be gained from an interdisciplinary perspective. Mathematical modelling, in particular, is increasingly recognised as a fundamental tool in understanding scientific phenomena, with models utilising mathematical disciplines ranging from statistics to differential equations. Geometry is an effective tool in biomechanical modelling, and one that has been used to develop a series of lessons regarding the functional importance of mathematics in nature. In this article, the authors present a lesson in which geometry is used to model the suction feeding mechanism of the Goliath Grouper, and the consequences of geometric variability for organismal performance are explored.

AB  - By means of their pivotal role in the outbreak of a variety of diseases, such as, recently, COVID-19, the molecular aspects of cell membrane function have gained considerable attention from researchers in recent decades. The resulting information explosion and the growing interdisciplinary character of cell biology seems, however, to not be represented in science classrooms. Hence, there appears to be a gap between what is scientifically known and what is actually taught in classrooms. Framed by the model of educational reconstruction (MER), the aim of our study is therefore to identify scientific core ideas of cell membrane biology from an educational point of view. This is achieved by conducting qualitative content analysis of relevant cell biology literature. By using Conceptual Metaphor as a theory of understanding, we additionally illuminate the experiential grounding of scientific conceptions. Our results propose that cell membrane biology can be structured into three core ideas, comprising "compartmentalisation," "physical and chemical properties," and "multicellular coordination" interrelated by evolution as a key aspect. Our results show that scientists conceive these ideas metaphorically. Embodied part-whole relations seem, for example, to lay the grounds for their understanding of biological function. The outcomes of the study may inform future cell membrane teaching.

AB  - The Korean STEAM education pursues a convergent human resources education, but there are shortcomings associated with it due to the fact that it excludes the Humanities in its curriculum. This study embodies the accomplishments from the design and field application of the STEAM education model that has added Humanities fields (history, geography, and bibliography) to the five areas of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics). The core principle of STEAM education is to utilize the traditional sciences as a medium that connects STEAM and the Humanities. It is designed to incorporate the eight core subjects as discipline studies of eight subjects and be implemented through the wheel model, developing into a multidisciplinary system. The STEAM education model was applied at two high schools over a two-year period as pilot programs. Both cases have undergone verification by the academia and have been reported in the news by the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS).

AB  - College curricula of engineering and information systems do not afford frequent engagement with individuals with disabilities. The authors of this research study analyzed the benefits of disability films for a community film festival of largely engineering and information systems students and individuals with developmental and intellectual disabilities. The authors learned that disability film media enables discernable engagement and advocacy of the students for the rights of individuals with disabilities. The authors also learned that the disability film media facilitates engagement and self-advocacy of the individuals for themselves. This study will be beneficial to instructors in engineering and information systems, and instructors in liberal arts, evaluating film media as an exciting method for involving students with individuals with disabilities on multidisciplinary projects of public service.

AB  - Climate change is one of the most challenging problems facing today's global society (e.g., IPCC 2013). While climate change is a widely covered topic in the media, and abundant information is made available through the internet, the causes and consequences of climate change in its full complexity are difficult for individuals, especially non-scientists, to grasp. Science education is a field which can play a crucial role in fostering meaningful education of students to become climate literate citizens (e.g., NOAA 2009; Schreiner et al., 41, 3-50, 2005). If students are, at some point, to participate in societal discussions about the sustainable development of our planet, their learning with respect to such issues needs to be supported. This includes the ability to think critically, to cope with complex scientific evidence, which is often subject to ongoing inquiry, and to reach informed decisions on the basis of factual information as well as values-based considerations. The study presented in this paper focused on efforts to advance students in (1) their conceptual understanding about climate change and (2) their socioscientific reasoning and decision making regarding socioscientific issues in general. Although there is evidence that "knowledge" does not guarantee pro-environmental behavior (e.g. Schreiner et al., 41, 3-50, 2005; Skamp et al., 97(2), 191-217, 2013), conceptual, interdisciplinary understanding of climate change is an important prerequisite to change individuals' attitudes towards climate change and thus to eventually foster climate literate citizens (e.g., Clark et al. 2013). In order to foster conceptual understanding and socioscientific reasoning, a computer-based learning environment with an embedded concept mapping tool was utilized to support senior high school students' learning about climate change and possible solution strategies. The evaluation of the effect of different concept mapping scaffolds focused on the quality of student-generated concept maps, as well as on students' test performance with respect to conceptual knowledge as well as socioscientific reasoning and socioscientific decision making.

AB  - Computing in the Arts (CITA) is an interdisciplinary Bachelor of Arts degree program, which integrates computer science with art theory and practice. We present a 6-year study that explores the impact of the CITA degree on broadening participation. We find that CITA attracts a different student population than traditional computer science degrees. We find that it attracts and retains almost twice as many female students as a traditional computer science degree. Finally, we find that it graduates approximately equal numbers of female and male students. The CITA curriculum maintains its strong computer science character, as it contains several core computer science courses and traditional upper-level computer science courses. We introduce the CITA curriculum model, which combines computer science courses, art courses and several structured synthesis experiences. We show that creating a CITA-like degree is fairly inexpensive, as the curriculum mostly reuses existing courses.

AB  - Young people now must compete in a global, knowledge-based, innovation-centered economy; they must acquire not just academic knowledge, but also character attributes such as intrinsic motivation, persistence, and flexibility. To accomplish these ambitious goals, the National Research Council (2012) of the United States recommends the use of "deeper learning" classroom strategies. These include case-based learning, multiple representations of knowledge, collaborative learning, apprenticeships, life-wide learning, learning for transfer, interdisciplinary studies, personalized learning, connected learning, and diagnostic assessments. Immersive media (virtual reality, multi-user virtual environments, mixed and augmented realities) have affordances that enhance this type of learning. EcoXPT is an inquiry-based middle school curriculum on ecosystem science that invites students into immersive experimentation with scaffolding tools that support deeper learning. This includes a "case-based approach" situated in an unfolding eutrophication scenario in which students learn new information from their observations over space and time, speaking with virtual characters in the world, and gathering information in the field guide and other sources. "Diagnostic assessments" of students' progress are based on multiple sources, including process data from various types of logfiles. "Multiple varied forms of representation" convey perceptual, graphical, and experimental data, enabling students to investigate relationships between variables. Students are "apprenticed" in the ways of knowing of ecosystems scientists, which involves "interdisciplinary knowledge." Students "collaborate" in teams of two, subdividing the tasks of gathering evidence.

AB  - Background: China has great student participation in STEM education. Chinese society has a progressive and positive attitude towards STEM as it is considered to provide more opportunities in life. Teachers play a vital role in the success of any STEM program in K-12 schools. However, teachers are facing instructional challenges because of the interdisciplinary nature of the STEM curriculum and the current typical school structure. The success of the STEM programs depends on teachers' beliefs and their knowledge in adapting to instructional implementation of STEM concepts. Results: The data (n = 216) was collected from STEM primary and secondary teachers from 25 provinces in mainland China. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was applied, and Pearson's correlation analysis was used to examine the correlation between Chinese STEM teachers' beliefs, knowledge, implementation, and the intrinsic challenges of STEM education; "t" tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to ascertain whether there were differences. The structural equation model (SEM) was applied to identify interrelationships. The results indicated that Chinese STEM teachers encounter higher-level intrinsic challenges to instructional implementations based on their beliefs and knowledge. Teachers who utilize their experience of teaching science as their main discipline and then attempt to integrate STEM using mathematics and engineering are likely to encounter higher-level intrinsic challenges in implementation. Conclusion: The intrinsic challenges perceived by Chinese teachers in the practice of STEM education can be predicted by their beliefs and knowledge base. Teachers who understand the nature and pedagogy of STEM education are more likely to encounter lower-level intrinsic challenges of STEM teaching, while teachers who utilize their main discipline when conducting integrated STEM learning activities through modeling based on science, technology, engineering, and mathematical problem situations are more likely to encounter higher-level intrinsic challenges. This study also reveals that there are some significant differences in the level of STEM teachers' beliefs, knowledge base, instructional practice, and their intrinsic challenges based on their teaching grade, seniority, and experience of STEM training and teaching.

AB  - Bioengineering represents an interdisciplinary field with the potential to engage young learners in science inquiry and engineering design in the context of real-world challenges. Although children encounter bioengineered products and solutions in their everyday lives, they are not introduced to bioengineering until much later in school, after stereotype threats about STEM engagement have crystallized. The purpose of this paper is to present an experimental tangible tool called CRISPEE and evidence from an intervention with young children who explored CRISPEE in the context of an informal bioengineering curriculum. In this design study, 25 children aged 4-7 years engaged in a 9-h workshop designed to introduce them to foundational bioengineering concepts of gene editing, engineering design, and bioethics. Children's attitudes and content knowledge about life science, engineering, and bioengineering were assessed pre- and post-interventions. Mixed quantitative and qualitative results show that most children entered the intervention with pre-existing ideas about genes and attitudes about engineering and science. Post intervention, children demonstrated increased positive STEM attitudes and content knowledge, especially in the area of science inquiry, and also demonstrated an emerging curiosity about the purpose and effectiveness of bioengineering work, including bioethics. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - To recruit and retain more students in all science disciplines at our small (5,000 student) public university, we implemented an interdisciplinary strategy focusing on nanotechnology and enhanced undergraduate research. Inherently interdisciplinary, the novelty of nanotechnology and its growing career potential appeal to students. To engage students in learning and to keep them engaged, we offer progressively more independent research opportunities with faculty mentors and encourage participation in a robust science learning community that supports students outside the classroom. Activities beginning in the freshman year build connections with faculty members and student peers and foster a growing individual identity as scientists. Since implementing this approach in 2005, a total of 73 students have enrolled and 32 have graduated. Half of the currently enrolled students are biology-chemistry majors and the rest are physics majors. We have significantly increased the number of student publications in peer-reviewed journals. These gains were achieved without sacrificing standards: 32 graduates have earned on average 148 credits and maintained a mean GPA of 3.17, and half have gone on to graduate school.

AB  - An interdisciplinary science course has been implemented at a university with the intention of providing students the opportunity to develop a range of key skills in relation to: real-world connections of science, problem-solving, information and communications technology use and team while linking subject knowledge in each of the science disciplines. One of the problems used in this interdisciplinary course has been selected to evaluate if it affords students the opportunity to explicitly display problem-solving processes. While the benefits of implementing problem-based learning have been well reported, far less research has been devoted to methods of assessing student problem-solving solutions. A problem-solving theoretical framework was used as a tool to assess student written solutions to indicate if problem-solving processes were present. In two academic years, student problem-solving processes were satisfactory for exploring and understanding, representing and formulating, and planning and executing, indicating that student collaboration on problems is a good initiator of developing these processes. In both academic years, students displayed poor monitoring and reflecting (MR) processes at the intermediate level. A key impact of evaluating student work in this way is that it facilitated meaningful feedback about the students' problem-solving process rather than solely assessing the correctness of problem solutions.

AB  - The teaching of entrepreneurship is currently a fundamental pillar in the construction of social responsibility with strong impact on the future economic development of society. The use of serious games in the entrepreneurship field is a way of encouraging students' motivation to become entrepreneurs and develop their skills in the field. In this paper, we describe the experience of using a serious game in the entrepreneurship field in the context of the classroom. For that, we adopt a quantitative research technique based on a survey research to measure the different characteristics experienced by higher education students when using serious games in the classroom to learn entrepreneurship. The students have multidisciplinary competences, coming from courses with strong emphasis in the area of management and technology. The use of the serious game allowed students to develop skills mainly in terms of innovation, leadership, strategic thinking, problem solving, business launch and risk management. On the other side, there were no significant benefits in terms of accounting skills, compliance with regulations, interpersonal, communication, and self-control and discipline.

AB  - Learning through designing digital games has recently emerged as a potential approach for school learners to boost their literacy development and learning in and across disciplines. However, existing knowledge on this relatively new approach is still fragmented, and little is known about its implementation features, associated learning opportunities, and possible challenges experienced by students. As such, the present review seeks to synthesize relevant research in terms of the three aspects stated above to better understand the concept of student game design as a literacy practice. A total of 30 peer-reviewed research articles published between 2010-2020 are included in this research synthesis. Findings reveal that there is considerable variation in how the literacy learning approach of student game design is currently implemented, with respect to the school learners involved and game-making tools adopted. Despite its diverse nature, the feasibility of literacy learning by game-making is confirmed across the reviewed studies, with the disciplinary literacy in computer science and 21st century literacy being most prominent. This review has also brought to light the potential of introducing students to content-based game design to foster interdisciplinary learning. In order to provide a balanced portrait, this review further identifies major challenges of learning with the game-making approach from students' perspectives.

AB  - This paper describes the results of a comparative study into the approaches used by science undergraduates when solving open-ended problems. This study adopted a pseudo-grounded theory framework to analyse six case studies, one from each of the science disciplines studied. The study involved 70 participants from 5 institutions solving open-ended problems using a think-aloud protocol. Analysis of the data identified a number of different approaches used by each subject group. Participants in psychology, pharmacy and sports rehabilitation used a greater number of novice-like approaches than participants in chemistry, physics and interdisciplinary science. The approaches used by physical science participants were very similar whereas those from pharmacy, sports rehabilitation and psychology were more varied and relied on students' ability to relate to a familiar context. Evaluation of the relative quality of solutions showed variation with discipline.

AB  - Tuebingen's "Sectio Chirurgica" (TSC) is an innovative, interactive, multimedia, and transdisciplinary teaching method designed to complement dissection courses. The Tuebingen's "Sectio Chirurgica" (TSC) allows clinical anatomy to be taught via interactive live stream surgeries moderated by an anatomist. This method aims to provide an application-oriented approach to teaching anatomy that offers students a deeper learning experience. A cohort study was devised to determine whether students who participated in the TSC were better able to solve clinical application questions than students who did not participate. A total of 365 students participated in the dissection course during the winter term of the 2012/2013 academic year. The final examination contained 40 standard multiple-choice (S-MC) and 20 clinically-applied multiple-choice (CA-MC) items. The CA-MC items referred to clinical cases but could be answered solely using anatomical knowledge. Students who regularly participated in the TSC answered the CA-MC questions significantly better than the control group (75% and 65%, respectively; P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). The groups exhibited no differences on the S-MC questions (85% and 82.5%, respectively; P > 0.05). The CA-MC questions had a slightly higher level of difficulty than the S-MC questions (0.725 and 0.801, respectively; P = 0.083). The discriminatory power of the items was comparable (S-MC median Pearson correlations: 0.321; CA-MC: 0.283). The TSC successfully teaches the clinical application of anatomical knowledge. Students who attended the TSC in addition to the dissection course were able to answer CA-MC questions significantly better than students who did not attend the TSC. Thus, attending the TSC in addition to the dissection course supported students' clinical learning goals.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) has been recognized as one of the fundamental skills that all graduates should acquire. For this reason, motivational concerns need to be addressed at an early age of a child, and reaching students who do not consider themselves candidates for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines is important as well if the broadest audience possible is to be engaged. This article describes a framework for teaching and assessing CT in the context of K-12 education. The framework is based on Agile software engineering methods, which rely on a set of principles and practices that can be mapped to the activities of CT. The article presents as well the results of an experiment applying this framework in two sixth-grade classes, with 42 participants in total. The results show that Agile software engineering methods are effective at teaching CT in middle schools, after the addition of some tasks to allow students to explore, project, and experience the potential product before using the software tools at hand. Moreover, according to the teachers' feedback, the students reached all the educational objectives of the topics involved in the multidisciplinary activities. This result can be taken as an indicator that it is possible to use computing as a medium for teaching other subjects, besides computer science.

AB  - This design-based research investigated the context and impact of a three-year practice-based professional development (PD) project introducing science teachers to pedagogical shifts required for full implementation and synergy among disciplinary literacy components of "Next Generation Science Standards" and "Common Core State Standards- Literacy." Participants included 42 middle school teachers from 12 primarily urban districts from one northeastern state. Researchers utilized a Theory of Change to guide the study. The interdisciplinary project team immersed teachers in experiencing innovative, standards-based, three-dimensional (3D) earth and space science (ESS) curricular units with embedded disciplinary literacy (DL) strategies. Teachers then adapted the 3D+DL units and implemented with students. Researchers used a convergent parallel mixed methods design to examine quantitative and qualitative data in the form of classroom observations to determine fidelity of implementation of 3D+DL practices, frequency of 3D+DL practices on the self-reported Science Literacy Survey, and focus group interviews to assess impacts of the PD project on teaching. Analyses revealed that teachers valued and embraced 3D+DL instructional shifts that supported teacher and student sensemaking in science. Teachers attributed project success to (a) project team collaboration to develop ESS units, (b) adaptability of ESS units, (c) explicit and direct instruction of 3D+DL, and (d) teacher sharing and reflecting on student success. The shift in teachers' understanding and practices of 3D+DL teaching and learning is likely attributed to teachers having the opportunity for sensemaking as learners with rigorous ESS units prior to implementing 3D+DL instruction with their students, which may provide guidance for future PD.

AB  - Collaboration has the potential to strengthen both professional learning and well-being for teachers. However, it can also bring problematic aspects, such as increased workload and conflicts. The purpose of this study was to explore biology teachers' experiences of collaboration to better understand how upper secondary school organisations can support teachers to obtain valuable collaborations. By analysing accounts of biology teachers' experiences of collaborations perceived as valued and less valued, I investigate how benefits and difficulties of the collaborations relate to organisational and situational conditions. Benefits and difficulties in different types of collaborations associated with high and low perceived value from collaborations can help identify ways to lower the cost and increase the gain for teachers in collaborations. The results showed that the chosen valued collaborations were often initiated by the teachers and typically involved benefits relating to both teacher "and" student learning. In the less valued collaborations, benefits were narrower, impacting teachers "or" students. The importance of structure was emphasised in most collaborations but management support appeared more important in interdisciplinary collaborations involving more than three teachers, while personal affinity between collaborators appeared more important in collaborations involving two or three teachers. Continuity was emphasised in order to give time for consensus and structure to develop, or to sustain discussions on important issues. Overall, this study shows that while continuity appeared important for developing valued collaborations, it can be difficult to obtain. Focusing on biology teachers' experiences of benefits and difficulties in relation to more or less valued collaborations can help school organisations prioritise support, time and resources for professional development to allow for continuity in valuable collaborations that can strengthen the quality of biology education.

AB  - The research experience for teachers (RET) professional development was a six-week long summer-intensive National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project that took place at a large university in western Texas. It was designed to provide a research-rich learning environment in data science and cybersecurity for STEM teachers in the region, which is mainly rural. Due to geographical isolation, rural teachers lack resources to prepare their middle and high school students for STEM careers and often find it difficult to bring innovative science teaching into their classrooms. The team was comprised of nine teachers, five professors, and six graduate students. We utilized discourse analysis within the situated perspective to examine teacher reflections and artifacts to discover how they assimilated disciplinary knowledge of data science and its application to cybersecurity and how they transferred this knowledge into their middle and high school curriculum. We found the teachers acquired this knowledge by gradually developing a scientist persona. They also acquired sophisticated pedagogical knowledge to integrate complex concepts into their middle and high school STEM curriculum without sacrificing the state standards, while creating a community of learners. This led to reduced feelings of isolation often experienced by rural teachers. It is clear that partnerships between universities and rural school districts can transform the way STEM disciplines are delivered, creating a strong pipeline for rural students in the STEM workforce.

AB  - The study investigates the relationship between pre-service teachers' scientific literacy (SL) and their environmental literacy (EL). It also seeks significant differences in SL at different levels of a tendency towards life-long learning (LLT). With the world facing critical environmental problems, an interdisciplinary approach to teaching science and environmental issues may help students to regulate their learning, foster curiosity, and stimulate their motivation to learn, all of which would influence their overall SL. For this pre-service teachers' understanding of SL with respect to the environment is important. The scores from tests that assessed pre-service teachers' SL and EL were analysed for correlation. Findings from the study show that pre-service teachers' SL is correlated with four dimensions of EL, environmental knowledge, environmental attitudes, perception of environmental uses, and environmental concern. Analysis of the data also reveals a significant difference between the SL of participants in the first and third levels of four levels of LLT, while there is no significant difference between the SL of participants at other levels. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) is an educational approach that integrates language learning with content teaching of subjects such as science. The CLIL approach regards culture a core component, however, science teachers often struggle to integrate a cultural component in their lessons. This study describes a pedagogical intervention using CLIL in a state school in Bogotá, Colombia. The first cycle of an action research project was implemented over the course of 1 year with 50 students (aged 15-19 years) and their teacher. Students used technology-enhanced CLIL-based environmental learning projects to integrate content (science) and a vehicular language (English). Questionnaires, a teacher's journal, artefacts, and interviews were used to collect data. The findings show students' positive perceptions of CLIL and highlight the value of explicitly considering a cultural component in science lessons, framed through a lens of scientific citizenship. Implications for CLIL and science education are discussed.

AB  - An investigation of the possibility of life in the universe, or astrobiology, is
an ideal topic for an interdisciplinary seminar course. Answering the topic's
inherent questions--whether life exists elsewhere in the universe and, if it
does indeed exist, whether we on Earth could contact such life--requires
an interdisciplinary approach and multiple perspectives from the sciences,
social sciences, and humanities. Described are several highlights of a
community college's 15-week seminar course, Life in the Universe, including
students' perceptions of the course elements as ascertained from an end-of-course survey. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - In primary and secondary schools, the disciplines encompassed in "STEM"--Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics--have usually been studied as separate subjects, with little effort directed towards non-anecdotal integration. "Integrated STEM education" is one of the most recent interdisciplinary proposals and, under its umbrella, school disciplines are beginning to be integrated in an educationally fruitful way. STEM as a renovated approach is gaining ground, despite the infancy of its philosophical analysis. Explicit epistemological discussion of integrated STEM proposals is either absent or blurred. The overall aim of this paper is therefore to establish an initial framework for philosophical discussion, to help analyse the aims and discourse of integrated STEM education, and consider the implications that adopting any particular epistemological view might have on the aims for general education, and on the construction of science curricula oriented towards citizenship and social justice. We envisage humanist values for integrated STEM education and, after revisiting the currently proposed relationships between the STEM knowledge areas, we adopt a model of a "seamless web" for such relationships that is coherent with humanist values. A few issues emerging from this model are addressed through the lens of the so-called "family resemblance approach", a framework from the field of research on the nature of science, in order to identify some potential central features of "nature of STEM".

AB  - Despite the increasing number of inclusive STEM schools, little is known about the cultural dimensions that influence STEM curriculum and instruction within these schools. This paper describes research conducted at three inclusive STEM schools, one each at the elementary, middle, and high school level. We explored similarities and differences in cultural dimensions across the schools with specific attention to how these differentially influence teachers' perceptions and enactment of STEM curriculum and instruction across the elementary, middle, and high school levels. Our cross-case analysis revealed structural aspects (school vision, community partnerships, course scheduling, and testing pressures) as well as professional orientations (i.e., instructional practices, interdisciplinary collaboration, and teacher content knowledge) that appear particularly important to student learning experiences at each grade level. Navigating these factors of STEM school culture requires teachers to not only be knowledgeable but also to draw on a professional orientation that encourages collaboration and risk-taking. We discuss implications for teacher education and STEM school development.

AB  - With the emergence of the "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS"; NGSS Lead States 2013), it is apparent that teaching and learning about nature of science (NOS) continues to be an important goal of science education for all K-12 students. With this emphasis on NOS, early childhood teachers are asking how to design instruction to teach NOS within the context of these new standards. During a recent research project, the authors had the opportunity to teach NOS to 70 first-grade students in an urban midwestern city. For this study, their instruction focused on the learning of three aspects of NOS from the "NGSS": Scientific knowledge is based on empirical evidence; science is a way of knowing; and scientific knowledge is open to revision in light of new evidence. However, it is important to note that other aspects of NOS, including "Science is a human endeavor," were also addressed. The lessons were integrated into the science curriculum and augmented with literature connections. Interwoven throughout these inquiry lessons were reading, writing, and drawing activities. These multidisciplinary lessons allowed them to address topics found in both the "Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts" (CCSS-ELA) (NGAC and CCSSO 2010) and the "NGSS" (NGSS Lead States 2013). In this article, they share examples of lessons and activities they used in the study.

AB  - The effectiveness of flipped classroom approaches can be improved by combining it with other pedagogical models such as inquiry-based learning. Implementing inquiry-based learning in flipped classroom scenarios requires teachers to plan arrangements for in- and out-of-class activities carefully. In this study, a design heuristic based on the 5E inquiry model was developed to support teachers' practice of planning inquiry-based flipped classroom lessons. Following a design-based research approach, the design heuristic progressed through two cycles within 2 years. The design heuristic was implemented in both cycles in an online professional development course for secondary mathematics teachers. In the first cycle, 18 lesson plans were collected and analysed using the 5E lesson plan scoring instrument. Results showed that the design heuristic helped teachers to set up lesson plans for flipped classroom scenarios which were mostly in line with the 5E model. However, the evaluation phase was insufficiently addressed. Revision decisions were made at the end of the first cycle, and the design heuristic was revised and re-implemented in a second cycle. Results of the second cycle showed another 19 participating teachers who also struggled in choosing appropriate assessment techniques, an issue which could not be resolved with the proposed design heuristic. This paper describes the development of the design heuristic as well as relevant design principles for inquiry-based flipped classroom scenarios. The proposed design heuristic is not domain specific. Hence, further research could examine its use in other subjects or interdisciplinary as inquiry-based flipped classroom approaches are one of the emerging pedagogies.

AB  - This study documented the means by which STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) educators experienced the mathematics and science associated with understanding lunar phenomena. The article reports how well STEM education graduate students interacted with projectbased materials as they engaged in interdisciplinary teaching and learning. Research questions pursued were: (a) How will students' spatial mathematics and scientific understandings develop as they engage in a contextualized, technology-rich, project-based environment? and (b) How will the students' group projects affect their understanding of lunar related concepts? A mixedmethods approach was used with this semester-long design study to expose how focused project work facilitated spatial understanding. Significant gains were made on lunar-related concepts that had been previously resistant to conceptual change (lunar motion and effect of lunar phase with location change). An implication of this study suggests that technologies (i.e., Stellarium, online blogging with Australia, and Geometer's Sketchpad) facilitated students' project progress, aided students' understanding of how perspective matters in terms of Earthly sky viewing, and deepened students' understanding on domains that included spatial reasoning.

AB  - The meaning of the term energy varies widely in scientific and colloquial discourse. Teasing apart the different connotations of the term can be especially challenging for non-science majors. In this study, undergraduate students taking an interdisciplinary, general science course (n?=?49) were asked to explain the role of energy in five contexts: radiation, transportation, generating electricity, earthquakes, and the big bang theory. The responses were qualitatively analyzed under the framework of conceptual metaphor theory. This study presents evidence that non-science major students spontaneously use metaphorical language that is consistent with the conceptual metaphors of energy previously identified in the discourse of students in introductory physics, biology, and chemistry courses. Furthermore, most students used multiple coherent metaphors to explain the role of energy in these complex topics. This demonstrates that these conceptual metaphors for energy have broader applicability than just traditional scientific contexts. Implications for this work as a formative assessment tool in instruction will also be discussed.

It identified the components of the national indigenous culture in the formation of the design of objects, problem of continuity in the development of different areas of the material and artistic culture. It substantiated the role of intersubject communications in the formation of professional competences of students-designers and the value of discipline "History of traditional culture" in the professional and artistic training of future designers. It characterized ways of making graphic design, with account of folk art traditions. It defined methods of integrated education in vocational and artistic activities. It proposed pedagogical conditions of future designers' professional competences formation based on acquiring scientific knowledge and specific technical skills.

AB  - The Democracy USA (DUSA) Project was an interdisciplinary experiential-learning project designed to engage students and faculty in the 2012 elections. It was launched in response to the U.S. Department of Education's national call to action ("A Crucible Moment") on civic engagement and democratic education. The project had five key components: affiliated coursework, a colloquium series, extracurricular activities, The American Dream Project, and collecting public opinion data. This article presents an analysis of pre- and posttest data collected from over 500 students at a midsize southern liberal arts college during the Fall 2012 semester. The findings underscore the importance of varied approaches and interdisciplinary collaborations to engage students in the democratic process. We find that students enrolled in DUSA classes demonstrated little change in their civic engagement. However, those who participated in cocurricular programming, extracurricular activities, or learned about the program during the semester exhibited changes in both their political skills and willingness to participate in politics.

AB  - Researchers have demonstrated a correlation between personal value, enjoyment and interest, and sustained engagement in science (Ainley and Ainley 2011). This article presents pedagogical strategies that use drama and discussion to explore students' everyday encounters with science by engaging the body and emotion. Drama-based discussions in science classrooms can be far-ranging as students express feelings and describe experiences in ways not common in science education. Teachers should be patient as the students express themselves, being very attentive to the students' comments, repeating and seeking amplifications and clarifications until students are satisfied that they have clearly communicated their ideas. This article outlines four teaching strategies, each of which is 30 minutes to 1 hour long. These strategies can be used as diagnostic tools to support the design of future learning opportunities that take into account students' current understandings.

AB  - In this article, the authors discuss the use of ecological concepts (ecology, boundary, niche) in educational research to understand if and how these concepts from one field of science (ecology) can bring a new understanding to another field of science (education). We have conducted a systematic search in the ERIC database to identify articles where key concepts from ecology, such as ecosystem, boundaries and niche, are used in educational research. An algorithm inspired by Rodger's (2000) contextual model of concept analysis was used to examine how the concepts contribute to explore, explain or understand an educational system or an educational process. We find that the use of ecology-oriented concepts is related to a circular rather than a linear causality between actors and environment and between thoughts and actions. Thus, an ecological educational approach is characterised by wholeness, and emphasizes context as well as the complex interconnected mechanisms in educational processes.

AB  - This study explored (1) pedagogical strategies in Educational Coding and Robotics (ECR) learning which can develop computational thinking of students and (2) the degree of teacher centrality in the ECR classroom. In addition, we investigated (3) the added value of the Small Private Online Course (SPOC) to teacher professional development (TPD). We analyzed reflections of 80 in-service teachers on TPD through the SPOC (1,091 statements) and conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 of them one year after completing the course and teaching ECR in the classroom (328 statements). The most prominent strategies immediately after the TPD were "constructing learning experiences," "tinkering & debugging," and "interdisciplinary learning," while one year later, "experiential learning" and "collaborative learning" were more common. Regarding the degree of teacher centrality, a year after teaching ECR curriculum the teachers had a significantly higher percentage of statements reflecting their role as a "guide-on-the-side" and as "a partner" of students in the learning process. Regarding the contribution of the SPOC for TPD, teacher statements revealed significantly more benefits than challenges in both points of time. Interestingly, the same categories emerged bottom-up as benefits and challenges: a variety of "control dimensions," "independent learning," "learning and knowledge management" and "collaboration." Implications for educational theory and ECR practice are discussed.

AB  - This study provides a solid validity inferential network to guide the development, interpretation, and use of machine learning-based next-generation science assessments (NGSAs). Given that machine learning (ML) has been broadly implemented in the automatic scoring of constructed responses, essays, simulations, educational games, and interdisciplinary assessments to advance the evidence collection and inference of student science learning, we contend that additional validity issues arise for science assessments due to the involvement of ML. These emerging validity issues may not be addressed by prior validity frameworks developed for either non-science or non-ML assessments. We thus examine the changes brought in by ML to science assessments and identify seven critical validity issues of ML-based NGSAs: potential risk of misrepresenting the construct of interest, potential confounders due to that more variables may involve, nonalignment between interpretation and use of scores and designed learning goals, nonalignment between interpretation and use of scores and actual learning quality, nonalignment between machine scores and rubrics, limited generalizable ability of machine algorithmic models, and limited extrapolating ability of machine algorithmic models. Based on the seven validity issues identified, we propose a validity inferential network to address the cognitive, instructional, and inferential validity of ML-based NGSAs. To demonstrate the utility of this network, we present an exemplar of ML-based next-generation science assessments that was developed using a seven-step ML framework. We articulate how we used the validity inferential network to ensure accountable assessment design, as well as valid interpretation and use of machine scores.

AB  - Engaging students with material associated with public budgeting processes can be a challenge. Our experience in an interdisciplinary seminar on education politics and policy suggests that a budget simulation exercise is an effective tool to achieve multiple objectives, including increased student engagement and strengthening student-learning outcomes, while offering a vehicle with which to explore significant policy issues. The effort described here draws on literature from both political science and education. It offers an approach that is adaptable and that can be used to encourage significant engagement from students with variable levels of prior experience and preparation.

AB  - The trustworthiness and expertise of professionals is much in demand even while they are derided as members of slippery, credentialized and self-serving elites. Eliot Friedson's three 'logics' provide a contextual lens for this deconstruction of 'professional' and are updated by adding Artificial Intelligence (AI) as putative fourth logic to provide a contextual background--so, Markets, Bureaucracy and AI are seen as alternatives to and influences on professionalism. This context suggests that it may already be too late to save 'professionals', but them paper confronts a significant conceptual deficit by using a second interdisciplinary lens, Clarke's Place Model, to critically deconstruct the 'place' of professionals to reimagine a commodious and accessible conceptualization, consisting of five dystopias and a potentially potent oxymoron--"inclusive professional." The Place Model is presented as an example of a Geographical Imagination (Massey), combining two conceptions of 'place': place as esteem and place as a changing position on the expanding horizons of a career-long growth of expertise. This novel conceptualization is then used to examine the dystopias and potential ideals of 'professional'.

AB  - Wind energy conversion systems (WECS) nowadays offer an extremely wide range of topologies, including various different types of electrical generators and power converters. Wind energy is also an application of great interest to students and with a huge potential for engineering employment. Making WECS the main center of interest when teaching power electronics and electrical machines can therefore be highly advantageous. This paper describes a novel teaching experience using wind energy as the starting point for understanding power electronics and electrical machines. The results point out the wide variety of concepts involved in the course, the numerous competences that it can enhance, and its positive reception by learners.

AB  - The project-based learning approach is a learning model that encourages the active participation of gifted students, supports high-level cognitive activities, requires a wide range of tools and resources, consider academic and social skills together and emphasizes the use of technology. technology. This study is based on the learning experiences of gifted children designed with project-based approach. The study employed a holistic single-case embedded design, one of the qualitative research designs. The study group of the research consists of four gifted students in a Science and Art Center in the South Marmara Region. Criterion sampling, one of the purposeful sampling types, was used to determine the study group. Learning experiences of the gifted children through project-based learning approach were determined via reflective journals. The data in the reflective journals written by gifted students were given with direct quotations within the framework of the main theme and sub-themes, and inferences and interpretations were made. It was found out that gifted children have an advanced level reflective writing ability. It was also observed that participants grounded their projects with real-life problems and made inter-disciplinary connections in their reflections. Besides, bearing the character traits of gifted children, the participants effectively used higher-level thinking skills ad cognitive strategies.

AB  - Social sustainability embraces literacy development as a means by which children integrate their knowledge in society and become powerful and meaningful. In this context, the development of writing among young children requires the design of new teaching strategies that allow for the multimodal repertoire brought by children into the classroom. Systemic Functional Linguistics offers tools for the analysis of children's multimodal writing, which plays an important role in their literacy development. Our research was carried out in an urban context, the participants being 12 children aged 7 to 8. Data were collected through participant observation, conversations, and the analysis of documents and products generated by the children. From them, we analysed two stories written by two girls, which showed the way in which the children created meaning by combining verbal and visual modes, and how these modes interact (intersemiosis). The performance of a literacy task in which children are able to integrate their knowledge and heritage into the classroom, may constitute an interdisciplinary tool for their participation and engagement in the school, thus leading to a more equal society. In consequence, we propose that the integration of a genre-based pedagogy in the classroom should include greater awareness in teachers of the value of pupils' multimodal assessments.

AB  - The Computer Science Teachers Association has asserted that computational thinking equips students with essential critical thinking which allows them to conceptualize, analyze, and solve more complex problems. These skills are applicable to all content area as students learn to use strategies, ideas, and technological practices more effectively as digital natives. This research examined over 200 elementary students' pre- and posttest changes in computational thinking from a 10-week coding program using adapted lessons from code.org's Blockly programming language and CSUnplugged that were delivered as part of the regular school day. Participants benefited from early access to computer science (CS) lessons with increases in computational thinking and applying coding concepts to the real world. Interviews from participants included examples of CS connections to everyday life and interdisciplinary studies at school. Thus, the study highlights the importance of leveraging CS access in diverse elementary classrooms to promote young students' computational thinking; motivation in CS topics; and the learning of essential soft-skills such as collaboration, persistence, abstraction, and creativity to succeed in today's digital world.

AB  - Within the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education community there are repeated calls for the reform of undergraduate teaching. Resulting change efforts often focus on developing and disseminating specific instructional ideas and practices to individual faculty. However, in this paper, the authors argue that these efforts need to be expanded to include more emphasis on faculty involvement in the change process, as well as on the environments and structures within which faculty work. They present four core change strategies that frame a broad span of considerations for enacting and sustaining new educational programs: (1) disseminating curriculum and pedagogy, (2) developing reflective teachers, (3) developing policy, and (4) developing shared vision. These strategies emerged from an interdisciplinary literature review of hundreds of articles in faculty development, STEM education research, and studies of higher education.

AB  - Evaluation as a particular kind of investigated discipline is distinguished from, for example, traditional empirical research in the social sciences or from literary criticism, criminalistics, or investigative reporting, partly by its extraordinary multidisciplinarity (Scrivens, 1991, p. 141). It is this unique multidisciplinary feature of evaluation that adds usefulness when determining the effectiveness of programs seeking to integrate mathematics and science teaching and learning across elementary and middle grade levels. In 2005, a K-8 mathematics and science program celebrated its 15th year of service. The program was the result of education, business, and community partnership efforts focused on improving mathematics and science teaching and learning in schools throughout a metropolitan region in the southeastern United States. This article focuses on the evaluation results for years 1 and 2, conducted from 1999 to 2004. It is concluded that the mathematics and science education program described in this  article was committed to increasing teachers' science and mathematics content understanding and developing their reflective practices. Just as important as it was to learn what were graduates' classroom practices and perceptions of the program, it was equally important to add to the body of evaluation literature on mathematics and science programs.

AB  - We present the "AI-Atlas" didactic concept as a coherent set of best practices for teaching Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to a technical audience in tertiary education, and report on its implementation and evaluation within a design-based research framework and two actual courses: an introduction to AI within the final year of an undergraduate computer science program, as well as an introduction to ML within an interdisciplinary graduate program in engineering. The concept was developed in reaction to the recent AI surge and corresponding demand for foundational teaching on the subject to a broad and diverse audience, with on-site teaching of small classes in mind and designed to build on the specific strengths in motivational public speaking of the lecturers. The research question and focus of our evaluation is to what extent the concept serves this purpose, specifically taking into account the necessary but unforeseen transfer to ongoing hybrid and fully online teaching since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our contribution is two-fold: besides (i) presenting a general didactic concept for tertiary engineering education in AI and ML, ready for adoption, we (ii) draw conclusions from the comparison of qualitative student evaluations (n = 24-30) and quantitative exam results (n = 62-113) of two full semesters under pandemic conditions with the result of previous years (participants from Zurich, Switzerland). This yields specific recommendations for the adoption of any technical curriculum under flexible teaching conditions--be it on-site, hybrid, or online.

AB  - Computer-assisted language learning, or CALL, is an interdisciplinary area of research, positioned between science and social science, computing and education, linguistics and applied linguistics. This paper argues that by appropriating methods originating in some areas of CALL-related research, for example human-computer interaction (HCI) or psycholinguistics, the agenda of "attention-focus" research can be shifted from a cognitive perspective to a learner-centred approach; understanding online language learning and teaching spaces as mediated by technology; second/foreign language learning; and online teaching culture. Taking a method that has traditionally been used within a positivist paradigm, the authors exemplify the potential of eyetracking to advance online language learning research--extending it in ways compatible with a sociocultural paradigm. This is evidenced by two pioneering studies in which an innovative combination of methods allows participants, whose gaze focus was recorded during synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC), to reflect back on their involvement. Eyetracking is combined with stimulated recall interviews that trigger deep refection on learner and teacher strategies by directing participants' recollections on their attention focus. The rich, multifaceted results shown by this original and innovative use of eyetracking methods in a sociocultural framework suggest a way forward in researching online learning by integrating insider and outside views coherently and systematically.

AB  - In the DISCUSS (Dialogic Inquiry for Socioscientific and Conceptual Understanding in School Science) research project, a Socioscientific Issues (SSI)-based curriculum is developed and implemented in sixth-grade science classrooms with predominantly English language learners (ELLs) in Houston, Texas. A four-week space unit is designed in collaboration with researchers and science teachers to improve students' science content knowledge, reasoning and argumentation, and academic language through dialogic inquiry of a central question: "Should the U.S. government increase or decrease funding for space exploration?" The unique features of the curriculum include the expansion of 5E instructional model to the 7E model for ELLs, the use of classroom discussions to facilitate reasoning and argumentation, and the integration of effective literacy strategies in lessons. Students investigate four-domain issues--technology, environment, economy, and public policy--associated with space exploration by reading argument texts, engaging in teacher-led whole class discussions and peer-led small-group discussions, and hands-on group work. At the end of the unit, students write an individual decision letter to address the central question. The multidisciplinary DISCUSS curriculum is promising to help teachers create language-rich science classrooms and promote science learning, reasoning and argumentation, and academic language development of all students especially ELLs.

AB  - This paper describes the results of a survey administered to members of the American Association of Physics Teachers and the National Earth Science Teachers Association to measure the nature and frequency of the integration of Earth and space science (E&SS) concepts into physics courses, as well as the need and interest of physics teachers to do so. Data included 92 responses from secondary physics and physical science teachers around the US. Results showed that physics teachers typically include E&SS content during the teaching of universal gravitation, circular motion, and Doppler effect, but that integration is usually limited to contextualized word problems. While the teachers surveyed are highly interested in learning more about E&SS integration, they are limited by time and a scarcity of quality resources.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to provide information on the main tendencies across the transformation of the official holidays calendar in Ukraine over the last decades and to demonstrate its influence on school celebrations. Also discussed here is the role of these factors in the parallel but sometimes contradictory processes of the students' civic identity formation. Design/Methodology/Approach: The article is based on documentary analysis, an interdisciplinary literature review and an examination of current practices with regard to national holidays in Ukraine. Patriotic rituals are analyzed through examples and evidence of school celebrations of the main calendar dates, including audiovisual materials in different school settings. The authors' observations have been corroborated with evidence from Ukrainian students and teachers as seen in the results of the questionnaire. These reflect their perception and experience of school celebrations. Findings: The results demonstrate that the transformation of the official holidays calendar in Ukraine has had an impact on school commemoration practices. This in turn has become a factor in the formation of students' civic identity. School patriotic rituals reflect a contradiction between the discourses of citizenship, patriotism and national upbringing in an emergent democracy in the continuing context of military conflict.

AB  - In response to a need to equip youth to become successful contributors to our growing digital economy, educators and researchers are exploring ways to incorporate computational thinking (CT) for all across curricular domains. In this paper, we take a place-based approach to examine how and what CT practices youth learn through designing mobile games in and for their own communities. We conducted three after school workshops with 29 participants (13 female, 16 male, ages 10-16) in a rural city in the Western United States. Youth designed place-based, mobile games to share stories and experiences about local environmental or civic issues using the Augmented Reality and Interactive Storytelling (ARIS) programming platform. We collected and analyzed a range of data including field notes, design artifacts, screencasts, and final reflective interviews. Using Brennan and Resnick (2012) framework for studying and assessing the development of CT, we illustrate how youth engaged with CT practices and how their local topics facilitated their engagement with civic issues beyond the screen. Findings demonstrate how youth can engage with CT practices and their local communities through designing computational artifacts. We discuss implications for how leveraging place-based computational tools afford equitable and accessible CT integration in interdisciplinary contexts.

AB  - The growing number of faculty positions in biology education, the formation of professional societies focused specifically on biology education, and the increasing number of publications in biology education over the past decade
point to the emergence of biology education as a relevant area of research for biologists. Doctoral programs focused specifically on biology education are explicitly designed to produce scholars prepared to advance knowledge
in the field, answering important questions inherent to biology education and serving as leaders in biology education reform. However, the limited number of doctoral programs specifically focused on biology education and the growing number of faculty positions advertised for scholars with this specialization suggests there is a need for additional programs with this focus. To address this need, Middle Tennessee State University recently developed an interdisciplinary PhD with a specific concentration in "biology
education." The program is a collaborative effort between the College of Basic and Applied Sciences and the College of Education and brings together faculty with expertise in basic biology, biology education, and
educational theory and practice to prepare scholars who possess the expansive set of professional skills that will allow them to advance the field of biology education. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - Many undergraduate students will experience being taught by graduate teaching assistants (GTAs); therefore, focusing on GTA pedagogy is in the best interest of the students and university as a whole. Based on a Masters of Arts in Teaching program, a 5-week intensive summer training session for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) GTAs was created by an interdisciplinary group of faculty. This study investigates how the intensive summer program can improve STEM GTA pedagogy by revealing STEM GTAs' beliefs about their role as a teaching assistant. Understanding what GTAs believe about their role will provide insight as to how to better prepare GTAs and, hence, help to improve STEM undergraduate education. The results of the study showed that GTAs' beliefs on teaching were initially more narrow in scope and then shifted to a greater understanding of the role of "teacher" in the classroom. Additionally, skills that helped GTAs with their pedagogy reportedly helped the GTAs as graduate students as well. These findings are insightful as we continue to learn how to prepare and train STEM GTAs.

AB  - The Deaf have often been overlooked when designing informal STEM education and public outreach activities. Astronomers at UC Riverside and teachers at the California School for the Deaf, Riverside (CSDR), have designed an astronomy workshop aimed specifically for the Deaf using the school's on-site sound lab. We have used astronomy for this workshop because the field has a significant edge over other sciences to act as portal for K-12 engagement in science given the imagery it presents, the answers it offers to grand questions, and its interdisciplinary nature. The workshop is an unconventional activity that excites the students and provides a positive experience in astronomy, based on knowledge that they already acquired beforehand in the classroom. Our workshop uses electromagnetic emissions, enhanced sounds and sonification processes of cosmic phenomena that have low frequencies and sufficiently distinguishable patterns which are delivered to students through a specialized designed sound lab for the Deaf. Storytelling paired with videos and images are used to give understandable meaning to the sounds of the Universe. Positive feedback was collected from over 80 students who participated in our workshop. Our activity can be reproduced elsewhere to further engage the Deaf community in science.

AB  - The importance of the topic of this study is determined by several factors: increased interest of linguists to the problem of interaction between language and culture; the need to study the onomastic units as body language. The purpose of this article is to identify the types of motivational nick names of famous American and English public figures, describing their positive and negative connotations. The leading approach to the study of this problem is multidisciplinary, which requires the use of such sciences as sociology, psychology, cultural studies, ethnography, etc. This article presents the findings of linguistic and cultural research aimed at identifying the semantic features of public nicknames as the key characters in the conceptual spheres of contemporary British and American societies. The materials of this paper may be useful in studying linguocultural language aspects, as well as for contemporary public debates about the place of nicknames in the English language.

AB  - As society increasingly relies on digital technologies in many different aspects, those who lack relevant access and skills are lagging increasingly behind. Among the underserved groups disproportionately affected by the digital divide are women who are transitioning from incarceration and seeking to reenter the workforce outside the carceral system (women-in-transition). Women-in-transition rarely have been exposed to sound technology education, as they have generally been isolated from the digital environment while in incarceration. Furthermore, while women have become the fastest-growing segment of the incarcerated population in the United States in recent decades, prison education and reentry programs are still not well adjusted for them. Most programs are mainly designed for the dominant male population. Consequently, women-in-transition face significant post-incarceration challenges in accessing and using relevant digital technologies and thus have added difficulties in entering or reentering the workforce. Against this backdrop, our multi-disciplinary research team has conducted empirical research as part of technology education offered to women-in-transition in the Midwest. In this article, we report results from our interviews with 75 women-in-transition in the Midwest that were conducted to develop a tailored technology education program for the women. More than half of the participants in our study are women of color and face precarious housing and financial situations. Then, we discuss principles that we adopted in developing our education program for the marginalized women and participants' feedback on the program. Our team launched in-person sessions with women-in-reentry at public libraries in February 2020 and had to move the sessions online in March due to COVID-19. Our research-informed educational program is designed primarily to support the women in enhancing their knowledge and comfort with technology and nurturing computational thinking. Our study shows that low self-efficacy and mental health challenges, as well as lack of resources for technology access and use, are some of the major issues that need to be addressed in supporting technology learning among women-in-transition. This research offers scholarly and practical implications for computing education for women-in-transition and other marginalized populations.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the practical work of learning designers with the aim of helping members of the information science (IS) and learning sciences (LS) communities understand how evidence-informed learning design of online teaching and online learning in higher education is relevant to their research agendas and how they can contribute to this growing field. Design/methodology/approach: Illustrating how current online education instructional designs largely ignore evidence from research, this paper argues that evidence from IS and LS can encourage more effective and nuanced learning designs for e-learning and online education delivery and suggest how interdisciplinary collaboration can advance shared understanding. Findings: Recent reviews of the learning design show that tools and techniques from the LS can support students in self-directed and self-regulated learning. IS studies complement these approaches by highlighting the role that information systems and computer--human interaction. In this paper, the expertise from IS and LS are considered as important evidence to improve learning design, particularly vis-à-vis digital divide concerns that students face during the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value: This paper outlines important ties between the learning design, LS and IS communities. The combined expertise is key to advancing the nuanced design of online education, which considers issues of social justice and equity, and critical digital pedagogy.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to discuss the implementation of case-based teaching and use of response technologies to graduate students in a food science course. The article focuses on teaching sensory science and sensometrics, presents several concrete examples used during the course, and discusses in each case some of the observed outcomes. Students' evaluations, peer feedback, and self-observations throughout the course collectively indicated that the particular initiatives were effective in engaging student participation and promoting a more active way of learning. Case-based teaching provided students with the opportunity to apply their knowledge and their analytical skills to complex, real-life scenarios relevant to the subject matter. The use of audience response systems further facilitated class discussion and was extremely well received by the students; this resulted in a more enjoyable classroom experience.

AB  - Spatial ability is a powerful systematic source of individual differences in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and technology (STEM). Abundant research has evidenced that psychometrically assessed spatial ability is a strong predictor of STEM achievement. However, its underlying cognitive process and relevant role in STEM education are unknown. From the perspective of cognitive neuroscience, spatial ability is also considered a human intelligence deriving from the cognitive processing of spatial information in the brain. With the help of the cognitive neuroscience paradigm of spatial navigation, in the present work, we investigate the spatial cognitive process among STEM students and its role in STEM education. A total of 172 undergraduates majoring in veterinary science participated in a spatial navigation test. Participants attempted to return a toy to its original place in an arena when given either internal self-motion cues only, external landmark cues only, or both in a spatial navigation task. Modelling analysis of 172 participants' spatial navigation behaviours showed that all the participants' spatial cognitive processes featured navigation cue integration. The results of the different tests showed that students with higher levels of navigation cue integration had better academic performance in STEM learning. The results also indicated that, surprisingly, better academic performance in science and mathematics relied more on the use of internal self-motion cues, while better academic performance in engineering and technology relied more on the use of external landmark cues. This study sheds some light on the spatial cognitive process and its role in STEM education from the cognitive neuroscience perspective, thus deepening the functional understanding of spatial ability as a systemic source of individual differences for STEM education, and provides an empirical reference point for interdisciplinary studies on the role of cognition in the context of STEM education. Implications on STEM learning design and STEM teaching were discussed.

AB  - Mentorship has been shown to have a positive influence on mentees but less research is available on the impacts for mentors, particularly those involved in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) outreach. As we work to enhance STEM engagement through outreach programs that include mentoring, understanding the impact on mentors that participate in these programs has implications for program design and offers new avenues for effective mentor engagement. This study explored the impacts of mentoring on undergraduate film and graduate science students who served as mentors in an outreach program for middle and high school youth. In this outreach program, a participant-centered mentorship model was implemented, with mentors supporting students in creating films about local climate change impacts in their communities. The focus was put on interdisciplinary work and the development of communication and relationship building in teams of students and their mentors. Data were collected from the mentors through surveys and interviews. As a result of their participation, mentors experienced professional and personal benefits, such as building teaching and communication skills, developing relationships and networking connections, and personal satisfaction. Several mentors reported high, positive impacts that resulted in changes to their career paths towards STEM education. Mentors who reported moderate or low levels of impact may have had past mentoring experiences that moderated the impact. Based on these findings, we suggest that mentor career and skill development is considered in the development of outreach programs and mentor training to enhance the impact on mentors and their engagement in STEM.

AB  - Mathematics is an important nature exploration tool used by all natural sciences. So it is usual that mathematical calculations are part of school science education. But how are these calculations perceived by the learners themselves? What are their attitudes to this part of the teaching process? The answer to this question is important for any teacher who seeks to improve her/his teaching experience. The paper deals with the research of learners' attitudes towards using mathematical calculations within physics lessons. Semantic differential for the sample of 230 primary and secondary school pupils was used in order to determine their attitudes towards this aspect and investigate the influence of grade and gender on the attitudes. The analysis of acquired data shows slightly negative learners' attitude to the mathematical calculations and some particular differences between grades and genders.

AB  - This paper examines the degree of multidisplinary cooperation for Geographic Information Science (GIS) education programs that award GIS-related degrees or certificates at US colleges and universities. We classified departments and courses into ten major disciplines using Dewey Decimal Classification. In the 2007-2008 academic year, approximately 40 per cent of GIS education programs related to multiple disciplines and nearly 20 per cent were involved with more than three disciplines. Geography was the major provider of GIS education programs, but the ratio between geography-related discipline and other disciplines combined was approximately 1:3. Fostering multidisciplinary GIS education programs should strengthen geography in general as well as GIS education. (Contains 9 figures and 4 tables.)

AB  - The integration of music and science is embodied in the music of the spheres, the ancient concept that the universe is ordered in a manner consistent with principles of musical harmony. This idea boasts a long history, from the teachings of Pythagoras (ca. 600 BC) through Isaac Newton in the eighteenth century, and makes a fascinating interdisciplinary topic accessible to middle and high school students. Several music-science correlations are explored, including the mathematical commonalities between musical intervals and planetary orbits. The article includes teaching suggestions and student activities.

AB  - When pressing societal challenges (e.g., COVID-19, access to clean water) are sidelined in science classrooms, science education fails to leverage the knowledge and experiences of minoritized students in school, thus reproducing injustices in society. Our conceptual framework for "justice-centered STEM education" engages all students in multiple STEM subjects, including data science and computer science, to explain and design solutions to pressing societal challenges and their disproportionate impact on minoritized groups. In the first part of this article, we extend our conceptual framework by articulating the affordances of justice-centered STEM education for one minoritized student group that has been traditionally denied meaningful STEM learning experiences: multilingual learners (MLs). Justice-centered STEM education with MLs leverages the assets that MLs bring to STEM learning, including their transnational knowledge and experiences as well as their rich repertoire of meaning-making resources, thus refuting deficit narratives of these students. To illustrate the affordances of justice-centered STEM education with MLs, we draw on examples from our instructional unit that engages students in the pressing societal challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the second part of the article, we report on an initial inquiry into how 14 undergraduate pre-service teachers made sense of our conceptual framework after participating in lessons from our COVID-19 instructional unit. Findings indicated that pre-service teachers perceived both opportunities and obstacles of justice-centered STEM education with MLs. We close by discussing what it might take to prepare the next generation of teachers to disrupt systemic injustices in and out of school.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify critical components for service science curricula that address the unique competency needs of the service sector. Design/methodology/approach: The method for this investigation included a comprehensive review, analysis, and synthesis of service science, as well as service science management and engineering (SSME) related literature. As human capital is of unique importance in this business sector, particular emphasis was placed on examining the need for human resource development-related content in service science curricula. Findings: Expansion of the services sector globally has been unprecedented. "Some analysts predict that by 2020, services will account for 50 percent of world trade" (Downe et al.). Yet a global shortage of graduates with the skills needed for success in service sector jobs has been forecast. Compounding this talent shortage is the relatively small number of degree programs available to prepare professionals for service sector jobs. Because the growth in the service sector has outpaced improvements in productivity, quality, and innovation, and there is a lack of skilled talent to address these challenges, increasing attention is being placed on service science curricula. Originality/value: Given the economic importance of, and current deficiencies in, the service sector it is poised to make a significant impact by improving service science education.

AB  - This study implements a design-based research approach to design and evaluate different scaffolding strategies for supporting student learning as well as promoting student agency within a computational science course. The course introduces computational methods and tools in the context of disciplinary problems for materials science and engineering students. Initial course offerings suggested that students were overwhelmed by the interdisciplinary nature of the course. Therefore, the research team evaluated different scaffolding strategies for supporting students' learning, and how those may have provided students with agency to self-scaffold when needed. Three rounds of data collection included 17 students who participated in individual semi-structured interviews to explore how they used (or not) different scaffolds. Five of the participants were recruited for the first iteration; six of them were recruited in the second iteration, and six more in the third one. The iterative process allowed us to adapt the scaffolding procedures for the third iteration from the data collected in iterations 1 and 2. The purpose of this study is to understand how students used different scaffolds, and what implementation strategies were effective according to student uses of these scaffolds in the context of computational science. The results suggest that students developed agency to self-scaffold when needed, as they benefited from multiple scaffolds at different steps of the problem-solving process. Moreover, providing worked examples without engaging students in their active exploration can be ineffective, but this engagement can be achieved using written explanations. Additional support may be needed at an early stage of skill development, so students have an idea of how to validate their model.

AB  - Design and design thinking are increasingly being taught across several disciplines--ranging from arts, architecture, and technology and engineering to business schools--where expertise plays a central role. A substantial corpus of literature on research in regard to design expert and design expertise has accumulated in the last decades. However, in spite of its importance for design and design education, the topic has remained largely unframed. A major goal of this study was to carry out an assessment of literature through leading interdisciplinary design journals in order to identify main topics and categorize them into thematic patterns concerned with expertise in design. A structured assessment approach based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) was used over 861 abstracts. The emerging thematic patterns associated with design expertise allowed a categorization at different levels of detail, which included 80, 50, 20, and 12 factors analyses, respectively. The major contribution of the study was to offer a structured assessment of key design literature that enabled to gain a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the thematic patterns in the discussion on design expertise. Implications of the identified key factors for design education are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this paper was to better understand the current practice of arts therapy in educational institutions in the Czech Republic comparing it to that in health-care institutions and other working environments. The research goal was to analyze the prevalence of the different fields of arts therapy, the main difficulties of clients, the therapeutic forms, the ways of interdisciplinary cooperation, and the groups of therapists (according to their age and duration of practice). The data collected from the first national survey using "The Practice of Arts Therapies" questionnaire were analyzed with descriptive and inductive statistics (Chi-square test). The 142 respondents who participated in the study were contacted mainly through professional associations. The significant characteristics of arts therapies in educational environments are linked to the diffusion of the respective arts therapy fields (music therapy being the most prevalent), the main difficulties of pupils (learning difficulties/multiple disabilities or no obvious problems), and to the length of practice of the respondents. The results can be used for the creation of a research-based map of Czech arts therapies in educational institutions and for further development of this area.

AB  - The foundation upon which surgical residents are trained to work comprises more than just critical cognitive, clinical, and technical skill. In an environment where the synchronous application of expertise is vital to patient outcomes, the expectation for optimal functioning within a multidisciplinary team is extremely high. Studies have shown that for most residents, one of the most difficult milestones in the path to achieving professional expertise in a surgical career is overcoming the learning curve. This view point commentary provides a reflection from the two senior medical students who have participated in the Student-as-Teacher program developed by the Department of Anatomy at Mayo Clinic, designed to prepare students for their teaching assistant (TA) role in anatomy courses. Both students participated as TAs in a six week surgical anatomy course for surgical first assistant students offered by the School of Health Sciences at Mayo Clinic. Development of teaching skills, nontechnical leadership, communication, and assessment skills, are discussed in relation to their benefits in preparing senior medical students for surgical residency.

AB  - Although environmental radioactivity is all around us, the collective public imagination often associates a negative feeling to this natural phenomenon. To increase the familiarity with this phenomenon we have designed, implemented, and tested an interdisciplinary educational activity for pre-collegiate students in which nuclear engineering and computer science are ancillary to the comprehension of basic physics concepts. Teaching and training experiences are performed by using a 4" × 4" NaI(Tl) detector for in-situ and laboratory ?-ray spectroscopy measurements. Students are asked to directly assemble the experimental setup and to manage the data-taking with a dedicated Android app, which exploits a client-server system that is based on the Bluetooth communication protocol. The acquired ?-ray spectra and the experimental results are analyzed using a multiple-platform software environment and they are finally shared on an open access Web-GIS service. These all-round activities combining theoretical background, hands-on setup operations, data analysis, and critical synthesis of the results were demonstrated to be effective in increasing students' awareness in quantitatively investigating environmental radioactivity. Supporting information to the basic physics concepts provided in this article can be found at http://www.fe.infn.it/radioactivity/educational.

AB  - In today's information age, developing data science competencies has become vital to fostering responsible citizenry. However, the actual techniques learners need to become proficient in are still somewhat "in-construction", as the relatively new field of data science is constantly expanding to meet new data-related demands. Data science education needs to develop innovative means to keep up with this expansion that focus less on proficiency in specific techniques, but rather introduce novices to authentic data practices, and the authentic purposes directing the authentic practices. This paper focuses on a specific practice, the use of simulations to generate and examine data, in the context of authentic scientific Citizen Science research. We provide a case study of one pair of middle school students' engagement in an extended learning sequence including simulation activities inspired by authentic data practices, adapted to also be authentic for young students. While the simulation activity was inspired by the scientists' purposes, our findings illustrate four different actual purposes the students attributed to it. We also show that as the students deepened their engagement with the simulation, they gradually appropriated its intended purpose, alongside articulating more mature views of data-related concepts. The conclusions summarize the four different purposes the students expressed and identify aspects of design that contributed to the gradual re-shaping process of their actual purposes.

AB  - This article describes findings and evolution of a teacher-training program based on a partnership of knowledge domains (technology, content, and pedagogy), teaching staff (college faculty and school teachers), educational institutions (colleges and K-12), and local communities (urban and suburban). Within 5 years, more than 180 teachers from 15 secondary schools attended a 3-tier summer institute and follow-up activities. Summer trainees were offered stipends, laptop computers, advanced graphing calculators, smart boards, LCD projectors, mentorship, and technical support during the academic year. While teachers were initially frustrated to learn outside their subject areas, they all completed the initial workshop and more than half returned in subsequent years for advance and expert level training. External evaluators collected data and conducted longitudinal analysis of performance indicators for teaching quality and student learning. Teachers reported increased level of student engagement in and comprehension of mathematics and science topics. Graduation rates and student achievement scores in partnering school districts increased noticeably during the initiative. Comparison of target and control groups showed that treatment students consistently outperformed non-treatment students.

AB  - Despite elementary teacher education programs preparing preservice teachers in the main content areas of literacy, math, science, and social studies, few elementary school classrooms teach all four content areas on a regular and thorough basis. Therefore, elementary education teacher preparation programs should be redesigned to support an integrated teaching model of all four content areas in order to better prepare preservice teachers (PST) to serve elementary students. The main research question for this study was "How does a collaborative and integrated elementary education program impact PSTs' knowledge and understanding of an integrated K-6 elementary classroom?" The sample included 12 preservice education students at a Midwest, private liberal arts university. The study occurred over three semesters in a newly developed integrated elementary education program. Data tools collected included: field experience lesson plans, preservice classroom observations, a survey of experiences, video-recorded lessons, and the edTPA. When looking at the different types of integration, the most common was interdisciplinary teaching where one content area supported the work of another. The lack of integration may be due to limited or no tools available to support preservice teachers to teach in this fashion. To answer the research question, it was found that the PSTs graduated from the preservice program and entered their own classrooms with a vague understanding of integrated teaching. Although our program was integrated in the delivery of content and field experience, the transparency was not revealed to the PSTs during their methods classes and field work.

AB  - Impact evaluation plays a critical role in determining whether federally funded research programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are wise investments. This paper develops quantitative methods for program evaluation and applies this approach to a flagship National Science Foundation-funded education research program, Research and Evaluation on Education in Science and Engineering (REESE). Results of three different bibliometric analyses all point to the same conclusion: REESE is an interdisciplinary research program that attracts highly productive investigators who exhibit an additional increase in their productivity rate as a result of receiving REESE funding. Limitations of the bibliometric approach are discussed, and directions are provided for the future of impact evaluations of research programs intended to serve the public good.

AB  - We piloted a semester-long, interdisciplinary, introductory science course using recently developed optogenetic technique as a main context. In neuroscience application, this technique introduces the gene of light-sensitive membrane protein into a targeted class of neurons, whose activity then can be modulated with a laser of specific wavelength. Such genetically modified and optically controllable neurons can be used to study the details of neural circuitries. This thoroughly interdisciplinary experimental technique provides an engaging modern context for studying and connecting various fundamental concepts and topics, such as genetics, biochemistry, laser, and nerve signaling. Students have learned how challenging scientific questions can be answered through the cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques from multiple disciplines, improving their scientific literacy broadly.

AB  - Energy is considered both a core idea and a crosscutting concept in science education. A thorough understanding of the energy concept is thought to help students learn about other (related) concepts within and across science subjects, thereby fostering scientific literacy. This study investigates students' progression in understanding the energy concept in biological contexts at the transition from primary to lower secondary school by employing a quantitative, cross-sectional study in grades 3-6 (N?=?540) using complex multiple-choice items. Based on a model developed in a previous study, energy concepts were assessed along four aspects of energy: (1) forms and sources of energy, (2) transfer and transformation, (3) degradation and dissipation, and (4) energy conservation. Two parallel test forms (A and B) indicated energy concept scores to increase significantly by a factor of 2.3 (A)/1.7 (B) from grade 3 to grade 6. Students were observed to progress in their understanding of all four aspects of the concept and scored highest on items for energy forms. The lowest scores and the smallest gain across grades were found for energy conservation. Based on our results, we argue that despite numerous learning opportunities, students lack a more integrated understanding of energy at this stage, underlining the requirement of a more explicit approach to teaching energy to young learners. Likewise, more interdisciplinary links for energy learning between relevant contexts in each science discipline may enable older students to more efficiently use energy as a tool and crosscutting concept with which to analyze complex content.

AB  - This paper presents findings from an on-going international study of Early Childhood (EC) teachers' and children's use of Internet of Toys (IoToys) to understand possibilities for developing children's cognitive capacities (e.g., creativity, inquiry, engineering design thinking). The study employed a Design Based Research (DBR) method, where teachers intentionally plan and deliver technologically constructed Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) experiences for preschoolers. Using Australia as a case study, data collection involved participant observation of three teachers' and 17 children's technology constructed play experiences with robotic toys, littleBits electronic magnetic blocks, alongside pre and post semi-structured interviews with teachers and children's photo voice sessions were video recorded. Analysing the findings using embodied cognition theory showed that the teachers, although novice in their own technological pedagogical knowledge engaged children's play with the robotic toys, and co-learn with the children. Integration of STEM-focused playful experiences supported children's scientific inquiry, design thinking and creativity as well as vocabulary targeted at interdisciplinary STEM concepts. With the ever increasing focus on developing children's 21st century skills, this study recommends engineering habits of mind, creativity and inquiry dispositions should now be taken into account in teaching and learning situations with young children and to develop STEM engagement.

AB  - Research on learning science in informal settings and the formal (sometimes experimental) study of learning in classrooms or psychological laboratories tend to be separate domains, even drawing on different theories and methods. These differences make it difficult to compare knowing and learning observed in one paradigm/context with those observed in the other. Even more interestingly, the scientists studying science learning rarely consider their own learning in relation to the phenomena they study. A dialectical, reflexive approach to learning, however, would theorize the movement of an educational science (its learning and development) as a special and general case--subject matter and method--of the phenomenon of learning (in/of) science. In the dialectical approach to the study of science learning, therefore, "subject matter, method, and theory fall together". This allows for a perspective in which not only disparate fields of study--school science learning and learning in everyday life--are integrated but also where the progress in the science of science learning coincides with its topic. Following the articulation of a contradictory situation on comparing learning in different settings, I describe the dialectical approach. As a way of providing a concrete example, I then trace the historical movement of my own research group as it simultaneously and alternately studied science learning in formal and informal settings. I conclude by recommending cultural-historical, dialectical approaches to learning and interaction analysis as a context for fruitful interdisciplinary research on science learning within and across different settings.

AB  - Although a large number of Spanish secondary schools have preserved an important scientific heritage, including large scientific instrument collections, this heritage has never been officially protected. Their current state is very diverse, and although several research projects have attempted to initiate their recovery and use, their lack of coordination and wide range of methodological approaches has limited their impact. This paper presents a case-study integrated in a new project supported by the Catalan Scientific Instrument Commission (COMIC) whose final aim is the establishment of a research hub for the preservation, study and use of Spanish scientific instrument collections. Major aims in this project are promoting a better coordination of Spanish projects in this field, and furthering international research on science pedagogy and the material culture of science. The major focus of COMIC is currently the recovery of secondary school collections. This paper provides first, a historical account of the development of secondary education in Spain, and the contemporary establishment of physics and chemistry school collections. Second, we focus on a case-study of three Spanish schools (Valencia, Castellon, and Alicante). Finally, we provide a brief overview of current projects to preserve Spanish school collections, and discuss how COMIC can contribute to help to coordinate them, and to take a step forward interdisciplinary research in this context.

AB  - Background: Issues of identity, interdependence, relationality and violence are far larger than the human species alone, although humanity has often pretended as if it alone were the beneficiaries of studying such ideas. Aim: Pedagogically, the complexity of existence beyond human being must influence the traditional humanities curriculum or risk further isolation and alienation within humanity-dominant narratives. Setting: As climate change continues to alter our comprehension of what is truly at stake in the survival of life on this planet, however, humankind needs a complete rethinking of its relationship with the multiple forms of life that dwell alongside it, as well as the traditional division between the humanities and the sciences within academic settings. Methods: It is with this scenario before us that I turn to the work of Bruno Latour who reconceives of humanity's relationship with nature as an interdisciplinary and boundary-crossing project, one that has deep pedagogical implications. Results: I demonstrate how Latour's collaborative and highly original work ranges across disciplines and provides new ways to contemplate research in academia. Conclusion: Latour's thought moves beyond polarising anti-humanist language and towards a way to limit the sovereign claims of humanity, opening discourse towards other non-human participants.

AB  - Systems biology is frequently taught with an emphasis on mathematical modeling approaches. This focus effectively excludes most biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology students, who are not mathematics majors. The mathematical focus can also present a misleading picture of systems biology, which is a multi-disciplinary pursuit requiring collaboration between biochemists, bioinformaticians, and mathematicians. This article describes an authentic large-scale undergraduate research experience (ALURE) in systems biology that incorporates proteomics, bacterial genomics, and bioinformatics in the one exercise. This project is designed to engage students who have a basic grounding in protein chemistry and metabolism and no mathematical modeling skills. The pedagogy around the research experience is designed to help students attack complex datasets and use their emergent metabolic knowledge to make meaning from large amounts of raw data. On completing the ALURE, participants reported a significant increase in their confidence around analyzing large datasets, while the majority of the cohort reported good or great gains in a variety of skills including "analysing data for patterns" and "conducting database or internet searches." An environmental scan shows that this ALURE is the only undergraduate-level system-biology research project offered on a large-scale in Australia; this speaks to the perceived difficulty of implementing such an opportunity for students. We argue however, that based on the student feedback, allowing undergraduate students to complete a systems-biology project is both feasible and desirable, even if the students are not maths and computing majors.

AB  - Team projects are a way to expose students to conflicting project objectives, and "[t]here should be a strong real-world element … to ensure that the experience is realistic" [ACM/IEEE-CS 2015b]. Team projects provide students an opportunity to put their education into practice and prepare them for their professional careers. The aim of this special issue is to collect and share evidence about the state-of-practice of team projects in computing education and to help educators in designing and running team projects. From a record number of 69 submitted abstracts, 19 were invited to submit a full paper. Finally, nine papers were accepted for publication in this and a subsequent issue. The articles presented in the present issue cover the following topics: real projects for real clients, open source projects, multidisciplinary team projects, student and team assessment, and cognitive and psychological aspects of team projects.

AB  - In this article, the underlying logic of experimentation is exemplified within the context of a photoelectrical experiment for students taking a high school engineering, technology, or chemistry class. Students assume the role of photochemists as they plan, fabricate, and experiment with a solar cell made of copper and an aqueous solution of sodium chloride. This multidisciplinary activity enables students to examine principles of chemistry, photonics, and electricity while reflecting the "Standards for Technological Literacy" and the "National Science Education Standards."

AB  - The current literature relates to how teachers develop knowledge and practice of science inquiry, but little has been reported on how teachers develop interdisciplinary science inquiry (ISI) knowledge and practice. This study examines the effect of university research experiences, ongoing professional development, and in-school support on teachers' development of ISI pedagogical knowledge and practices. It centers on documenting diverse teachers' journeys of experiencing ISI as well as developing knowledge of ISI. It was found that there was variation in ISI understanding and practice among the teachers as a result of the combination of teachers' experiences, beliefs, and participation. Thus, in order to help teachers develop ISI knowledge and pedagogy, barriers to ISI knowledge development and implementation must also be addressed. Professional developers must articulate clear program goals to all stakeholders including an explicit definition of ISI and the ability to recognize ISI attributes during research experiences as well as during classroom implementation. Teachers must also be held accountable for participation and reflection in all aspects of professional development. Program developers must also take into consideration teachers' needs, attitudes, and beliefs toward their students when expecting changes in teachers' cognition and behavior to teach inquiry-rich challenging science.

AB  - The authors of this article suggest a thesis about the purpose of teaching a foreign language--it is student's communicative activities, i.e. learning a foreign language in practice. The teacher's task is to encourage activities of every student and to create situations to develop their creative activities in a learning process. New information technologies streamline and diversify the learning process and, at the same time, open up good prospects to expand the educational framework and undoubtedly bring an incredible motivational drive and promote the principles of individualization of learning. At the current stage of development, the educational system tends to gradually shift towards learner-centered cooperation where a learner plays an active role. Non-standard technologies, encouragement of teacher's creative pursuit and professional advancement, and implementation of innovations proved to be useful in the learning and educational process.

AB  - An interdisciplinary curriculum unit that used Web GIS mapping to investigate malaria disease patterns and spread in relation to the environment for a high school Advanced Placement Environmental Science course was developed. A feasibility study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of the unit to promote geospatial thinking and reasoning skills and content understandings. Results revealed increased content understandings and significant effect sizes for all three geospatial thinking and reasoning subscales--inferences, relationships, and reasoning. The findings provide support that Web GIS, with appropriate curriculum design can improve both learning outcomes and geospatial thinking and reasoning skills.

AB  - As the presence of engineering content and practices increases in science education, the distinction between the two fields of science and technology education becomes even more vague than previously theorized. Furthermore, the addition of engineering to the title of the profession raises the question of the true aim of technology education. As a result, the technology and engineering education community must effectively communicate its role in an evolving STEM education landscape. During this time of change, it is important that we understand how the technology education profession has transitioned in the past while we figure out how to balance traditions and contemporary needs. The authors present three pathways that appear most salient in moving forward: (1) adhering to the fundamental goals of technology education, (2) collaborating with science education to potentially become a core discipline, or (3) revitalizing the field through a shift to engineering education. A final recommendation is made to energize the field by centering on becoming a true provider of K-12 engineering education.

AB  - This article reports and reflects on the design and use of the board game KEEP COOL on climate change. The game covers and integrates central biophysical, economic, and political aspects of the issue. By using a board game as common language between students and scientists from different scientific cultures, knowledge of different disciplines can be integrated and different views can be discussed. Thus, even complex issues such as the free-rider problem, trade-offs between adaptation to and mitigation of climate change, and path dependencies can be studied. KEEP COOL is the first game on climate change that is readily available from a commercial publisher. It has successfully been used in multiple settings, for example, as a tool for interdisciplinary research, public relations, public understanding of science, and, in particular, teaching. The experience with the game indicates that it can be effectively used in seminars with students to obtain a holistic picture of the issue and to lay out a common language for deeper reflections on climate change. This contribution also identifies some pitfalls and essential instruments for its adequate use for teaching.

AB  - This is an exciting time to be a biologist. The advances in our field and the many opportunities to expand our horizons through interaction with other disciplines are intellectually stimulating. This is as true for people tasked with helping the field move forward through support of research and education projects that serve the nation's needs as for those carrying out that research and educating the next generation of biologists. So, it is a pleasure to contribute to this edition of "CBE--Life Sciences Education". This column will cover three aspects of the interactions of physics and biology as seen from the viewpoint of four members of the Division of Undergraduate Education of the National Science Foundation. The first section places the material to follow in context. The second reviews some of the many interdisciplinary physics-biology projects we support. The third highlights mechanisms available for supporting new physics-biology undergraduate education projects based on ideas that arise, focusing on those needing and warranting outside support to come to fruition.

AB  - We report on the experience of creating a socially networked system, the Research-oriented Social Environment (RoSE), for representing knowledge in the form of relationships between people, documents, and groups. Developed as an intercampus, interdisciplinary project of the University of California, this work reflects on a collaboration between scholars in the humanities, software engineering, and information studies by providing an opportunity not only to synthesize different disciplinary perspectives, but also to interrogate and challenge the assumptions each brings to team-based design projects in the digital humanities. This work examines socially networked knowledge as both content and methodology for collaboration, calling for further critique and future investigation of epistemological questions in models of social networks. (Contains 6 notes and 2 figures.)

AB  - The focus on Computer Science Education at the K-12 level has been increasingly highlighted due to today's need for a populace with computational thinking skills, in addition to the expansion of careers related to computing and computer science. Programming helps facilitate students' examination of the nature of a problem and helps students to increase their computational thinking, problem-solving and higher-order thinking skills through the combination of multiple disciplines in areas such as science, the arts, engineering, and mathematics. How to facilitate the teaching of programming to younger learners has become an essential question, as programming by itself focuses more on structure, debugging, and syntaxes. Becoming involved with a second discipline provides students with additional opportunity to form creative solutions to a given problem as it provides a different perspective and helps link academic problem solving with the real world. The current study is an example of how to involve mathematics as the second discipline in the teaching of programming, and to see the differences between the acquisition of programming skills and its retention. Quasi-Experimental Research was conducted on a large sample (N = 188), with four groups randomly assigned as experimental and control groups. The results of the study show that the increment on students' programming skills and retention of those who learned programming through the integration of mathematics as the second discipline were higher than students who learned programming through traditional methods. These results were also found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05).

AB  - The need for a more robust, well-trained STEM workforce is becoming increasingly acute in the United States, and there is a clear need to recruit and retain a larger and more diverse population of undergraduate STEM majors. Although numerous efforts to improve engagement and support in the traditional P-16 classroom have been implemented successfully, it is also critical to explore other types of activities that have potential for high impact. The STEM Club Leadership for Undergraduate STEM Education, Recruiting and Success project at our large public research university in the Mountain West presents an outreach model to engage undergraduate STEM majors in developing and facilitating activities in local middle and high school STEM clubs. Through case studies, built on data from reflective journals and semi-structured interviews, the project has identified a number of benefits to the first cohort of participants, which is comprised of 11 undergraduate students operating in interdisciplinary teams across five schools. In this article we describe the essential elements of our outreach model and suggest benefits related to undergraduates' content knowledge, communication skills, metacognition, and identity as a future STEM professional.

AB  - The authors developed a lesson for teachers to integrate chemistry and culinary arts, providing students with an opportunity to participate in three-dimensional learning, engage in science and engineering practices, and apply disciplinary core content and crosscutting concepts (Krajcik et al. 2014). The project involved five classes: three integrated chemistry and physics (ICP) classes and two culinary arts (CA) classes, with mainly sophomores and juniors. The lesson was part of a larger interdisciplinary project involving multiple classes working together to develop a gingerbread house community with an interactive light and music show. The ICP students' task was to design a window panel on a gingerbread house out of candy with optimal transparency and provide data-driven recommendations to CA students for the proportion of sugars to use in the candy recipe. Students learned about the structure and properties of key components of candy (glucose and sucrose) and how the proportion of glucose and sucrose in the mixture affects the molecular structure, transparency, and hygroscopicity. (A hygroscopic substance is one that readily attracts water through its surroundings, through either absorption or adsorption. Hygroscopicity is the percentage of moisture on the surface.) This article describes the project with particular attention to the teacher scaffolding of the inquiry and examples of student artifacts.

AB  - Reform to the Chilean educational system seeks to improve public education, adapting the school curriculum to new technologies and the information revolution. Our study focused on highlighting potential issues with environmental and technological education, offering opportunities to complement the current Chilean curriculum with an interdisciplinary approach. During a five-week period interspersed through the school semester, 115 underprivileged children in seventh grade from five public schools of southern Chile participated in workshops based on Arduino technology to address current environmental problems caused by global change and anthropization. Surveys were conducted to participating students and included both open and closed-ended questions, which measured attitudes and perceptions towards science and the use of technology in classrooms and daily lives. Surveys were analysed quantitatively with basic statistics and qualitatively by building semantic networks of the relationships between different concepts expressed by the students. Results did not show significant changes in attitudes towards science or technology before and after the workshops but students reported mixed feelings about science. Indifference and fear emerged, coupled with the need for more interactive experiences. Curiosity and enthusiasm also surfaced when students were using new technologies. Since the school curriculum is generally focused exclusively towards the completion of specific curricular aims, highly vulnerable schools in Chile have few opportunities to access interactive, hands-on activities. Low-cost, emergent technologies, such Arduinos, have a high potential for improving student's attitude towards science and technology and their use should be considered when tailoring school curriculum in Chile and elsewhere.

AB  - Despite the poor outcomes for U.S. students on national writing tests, overall research on how to teach writing is sparse, and this scarcity is more pronounced in the early years of beginning to write. In this study 81,200 we present preliminary findings from Year 1 of a 3-year Institute of Education Sciences-funded Goal 2 project aimed at improving the writing performance of kindergarten children. We designed peer assisted writing strategies (PAWS) and tested its feasibility and promise. Participants for this study were 86 kindergartners ranging in age from 62 to 76 months, recruited from five classes in two different schools. It was feasible for research staff to deliver PAWS, which combined the need to focus early writing instruction on critical transcription skills with an effective learning pedagogy (i.e., peer-assisted learning). Lessons that targeted writing letters focused on formation and fluency, and lessons that targeted spelling focused on teaching letter sound correspondence for spelling decodable words and recognition and spelling practice for sight words. Results indicated that there were statistically significant differences between the PAWS participants and the control children on the alphabet fluency and essay post-test measures. Thus preliminary results indicate that PAWS instruction helped children, on average, improve early writing skills. Directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - An important element of STEAM education that teachers struggle with is the adoption and application of digital technologies. Digital technologies have the potential to enhance social inclusion and student-centred learning, and for this reason it is important for teachers across all levels of schooling to develop skills and confidence in this area (Digital Education Advisory Group, 2013). The aim of this article is to illustrate innovative teaching practices through an integrated STEAM project using Kitsi Blocks (Kitsunei, 2019) as the core digital technology. Kitsi Blocks may be described as a fabrication technology, enabling students to collect digital data for analytical purposes and/or to send data to instruct physical things to move, light up or make sounds. The technology is comprised of physical Kitsi Blocks, which house different electronic components in a small plastic casing, and virtual blocks that build the computational logic in a visual programming system called the Kitsunei Creator. The authors demonstrate a thematic STEAM approach to the ideas of 'beat' and 'rhythm' by describing the integration of science, mathematics, digital technologies and music that is aligned with the Australian Curriculum (ACARA, 2020).

AB  - Primary practitioners are tasked with the simultaneously exciting and daunting task of delivering a breadth of curriculum subjects to primary-age children. This makes the choice of profession a varied and engaging vocation in which no day is the same as the one before. When looking ahead at science medium-term planning, it may seem like a considerable challenge to cover all the necessary learning objectives in just six weeks. Primary science is often viewed as the 'non-core' core subject. In this article, the author addresses the challenges of offering high-quality science experiences in the classroom while also meeting the range of curriculum expectations. The ideas presented demonstrate a fraction of the ways in which science can be established at the core of the primary classroom.

AB  - The development of experiential learning methodologies is gaining attention, due to its contributions to enhancing education quality. It focuses on developing competencies, and build-up added values, such as creative and critical thinking skills, with the aim of improving the quality of learning. The interdisciplinary mechatronics field accommodates a coherent interactive concurrent design process that facilitates innovation and develops the desired skills by adopting experiential learning approaches. This educational learning process is motivated by implementation, assessment, and reflections. This requires synergizing cognition, perception, and behavior with experience sharing and evaluation. Furthermore, it is supported by knowledge accumulation. The learning process with active student's engagement (participation and investigation) is integrated with experimental systems that are developed to facilitate experiential learning supported by properly designed lectures, laboratory experiments, and integrated with course projects. This paper aims to enhance education, learning quality, and contribute to the learning process, while stimulating creative and critical thinking skills. The paper has adopted a student-centered learning approach and focuses on developing training tools to improve the hands-on experience and integrate it with project-based learning. The developed experimental systems have their learning indicators where students acquire knowledge and learn the target skills through involvement in the process. This is inspired by collaborative knowledge sharing, brainstorming, and interactive discussions. The learning outcomes from lectures and laboratory experiments are synergized with the project-based learning approach to yield the desired promising results and exhibit the value of learning. The effectiveness of the developed experimental systems along with the adopted project-based learning approach is demonstrated and evaluated during laboratory sessions supporting different courses at Sanyo-Onoda City University, Yamaguchi, Japan, and at the American University in Cairo.

AB  - Business is progressively integrating technologies and R&D with corporate and business strategy. This trend is creating increasing demand for executives and managers who have sufficient technology-centered knowledge to work effectively in interdisciplinary environments. This study addresses how management education could address the growing need for such pluralistic training by embracing development of undergraduate science curriculum attuned to the needs of business students. We found that science courses are part of the required curriculum at 80% of "Business Week's" "top business schools." To assess what content and learning objectives might best meet the needs of business students, we conducted a survey of educators from business, science, and arts and sciences in general and examined curriculum developed explicitly for business students at two freestanding business institutions. These results suggest that science courses could better serve business education by providing a broad picture of scientific principles and their presence in everyday life, promoting critical thinking and inductive reasoning, and enabling understanding of scientific research, technical innovation, and product development as well as their ethical and social implications. Development of such courses would require collaboration between management and science educators to ensure that the scientific content of the courses meet the highest standards of evidence-based science education and the business context is grounded in rigorous management principles and practices.

AB  - Importance of online learning has become more critical with the advent of a global pandemic. Effective online learning requires design characteristics that support learning that crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries. The example of educational delivery of food safety encompasses multiple disciplines to prepare students for real-world situations, practical problem-solving, and to be "future proof" as food safety becomes more quantitative. This study explicates how six simulation-based learning modules were evaluated, two each in microbiological growth/inactivation, food process dynamics with microbiological growth/inactivation, and risk assessment. Each group of three modules was targeted to the students in undergraduate food science and engineering programs. Altogether, the 6 modules were implemented and assessed in 17 courses at 14 universities over 5 years. The effectiveness of the module-based approach was sustained across subject matter (microbiology, process, and risk), disciplines (food science and engineering), and their implementations. Students' and instructors' survey responses indicated the modules' value in real-world and practical problem-solving ability. Instructors were also motivated to implement the modules as they saw the potential for improvement in student understanding, how modules reinforced course learning outcomes, the quality of support provided with modules, and their ability to replace existing course assessment without adding work for the instructor or the students. This self-learning, module-based approach to introduce interdisciplinary content employed has proven successful. The template for making these modules is described in sufficient detail so future modules can be built for a wide variety of subject matter beyond food safety.

AB  - Communicating climate information is challenging due to the interdisciplinary nature of the topic along with compounding cognitive and affective learning challenges. Graphs are a common representation used by scientists to communicate evidence of climate change. However, it is important to identify how and why individuals on the continuum of expertise navigate graphical data differently as this has implications for effective communication of this information. We collected and analyzed eye-tracking metrics of geoscience graduate students and novice undergraduate students while viewing graphs displaying climate information. Our findings indicate that during fact-extraction tasks, novice undergraduates focus proportionally more attention on the question, title and axes graph elements, whereas geoscience graduate students spend proportionally more time viewing and interpreting data. This same finding was enhanced during extrapolation tasks. Undergraduate novices were also more likely to describe general trends, while graduate students identified more specific patterns. Undergraduates who performed high on the pre-test measuring graphing skill, viewed graphs more similar to graduate students than their peers who performed lower on the pre-test.

AB  - College science is often poorly taught and it is rare that any consideration is given to the nine visions for reform of science teaching featured in the National Science Education Standards (NSES) (NRC 1996, p. 52). It is even more rare to see interdisciplinary science courses taught in colleges. At many universities, this is changing where there are Science-Technology-Society (STS) enthusiasts. For example, Clemson University (Cheek 2006) is struggling with developing such courses as part of their general education requirements for all undergraduates and similar changes are occurring in Turkish higher education.

Capturing an image of the landscape of Biochemistry Education Research (BCER) is complicated, however, by the interdisciplinary nature of biochemistry courses that may be taught at different levels and in different departments, even at the same institution. To develop a model that provides a sense of what research has been done, so far, we have investigated the literature on biochemistry education research within the contexts of the traditional biochemistry lecture and laboratory environments as well as courses taught within the health sciences, medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and molecular biology, as well as courses that combine biochemistry with other topics in chemistry, such as general chemistry and organic chemistry. We found that existing BCER has focused primarily on the lecture/classroom environment. Only about one-fourth of the BCER literature has been based on research in the laboratory setting. We also noted that the primary focus of research done so far has been on the structure/function properties of proteins. The goal of this review was a holistic understanding of the results of BCER that could be used by instructors to shape classroom practice as well as to provide BCER practitioners with an idea of the gaps in the existing literature that could be filled by future research. To transform the results of our analysis into a publishable form, we have used a format in which brief summaries of the topics of the BCER papers are presented.

AB  - Does early exposure to information literacy promote long-term student success? This paper describes a longitudinal case study testing the hypothesis that students who engage with scientific literature and develop information literacy early in their undergraduate studies will achieve higher grades on literature-based assignments in future coursework. We reasoned that students with previous experience in the scientific literature will develop more efficient and effective strategies to search and evaluate the literature and will ultimately favor higher-quality journals. To test these hypotheses, student performance data were collected during scientific literature-based assignments in two upper-division undergraduate lecture courses, Biochemistry 1 and Biochemistry 2. Data were analyzed from two student populations: students with prior information literacy instruction and critical practice from an Honors General Chemistry course sequence, and those students who had not undergone this training. The results indicate that, in Biochemistry 1, students with this prior information literacy training tend to use more professional, expert-like tools for exploring scientific literature and earn statistically higher scores on literature-based projects. However, by Biochemistry 2, the gaps close in both the exploration of the scientific literature and grade performance. This indicates that once students develop a foundation in information literacy, their sophistication in finding information and their performance on subsequent literature-based tasks improve. There was a small and statistically insignificant tendency for groups containing more students with prior information literacy training to cite more articles from the primary literature. However, the quality of the citations, as measured by journal impact factors, did not differ between the populations. The results of this interdisciplinary case study suggest that teaching information literacy to science students has both immediate and long-lasting benefits.

AB  - This paper explores how to practice posthumanism in everyday life. This idea has increasingly come under scrutiny by posthumanist theorists, who are addressing fundamental ontological and epistemological questions in regard to defining an essential "human," as well as the elastic boundary work between the human and nonhuman subject. Posthumanism is essential for considering today's environmental problems and environmental science education. This paper then has three goals: developing posthumanist ontology, exploring methodology, and investigating whether environmental science education and practices can help students, teachers, and community in learning, teaching, and practicing processes. I demonstrate the complementary contributions from two Indigenous communities' field studies that can be made when a researcher moves beyond an exclusive focus on western interests and considers participants as co-researchers. This paper concludes with a discussion of implications for this field.

AB  - Community awareness must be increased for communities to play an effective role in the mitigation of disaster damage. Education is the most effective way to accomplish this. It is important for people to know that even though they cannot intervene or prevent such events, they can take precautionary measures to reduce  the damage caused by disasters. Therefore, the opinions of teachers in primary science education about these events and their risks are critical since they are responsible for teaching children about these important issues. The study group of  this research included science and technology teachers in 2011 in Kocaeli-izmit, and semi-structured interviews with teachers were conducted. This study was conducted with the working group of 20 volunteer teachers on their appointment dates only. First, the science teacher guidebooks published by the Ministry of National Education were examined. Units and learning outcomes about the risks created by natural disasters and "Safe Living and Disaster Prevention" interdisciplinary learning outcomes have been identified. According to the results, half of the teachers interviewed think that education about natural events and disasters should really be a part of the Primary Science and Technology Program, but that unfortunately it is not.

AB  - In this article, the argument is put forth that controversies about the scope and limits of science should be considered in Nature of Science (NOS) teaching. Reference disciplines for teaching NOS are disciplines, which reflect upon science, like philosophy of science, history of science, and sociology of science. The culture of these disciplines is characterized by controversy rather than unified textbook knowledge. There is common agreement among educators of the arts and humanities that controversies in the reference disciplines should be represented in education. To teach NOS means to adopt a reflexive perspective on science. Therefore, we suggest that controversies within and between the reference disciplines are relevant for NOS teaching and not only "the" NOS but "about" NOS should be taught, too. We address the objections that teaching about NOS is irrelevant for real life and too demanding for students. First, we argue that science-reflexive meta-discourses are relevant for students as future citizens because the discourses occur publicly in the context of sociopolitical disputes. Second, we argue that it is in fact necessary to reduce the complexity of the above-mentioned discourses and that this is indeed possible, as it has been done with other reflexive elements in science education. In analogy to the German construct "Bewertungskompetenz" (which means the competency to make informed ethical decisions in scientific contexts), we suggest "epistemic competency" as a goal for NOS teaching. In order to do so, science-reflexive controversies must be simplified and attitudes toward science must be considered. Discourse on the scientific status of potential pseudoscience may serve as an authentic and relevant context for teaching the controversial nature of reflexion on science.

AB  - Efforts to promote the use of student-centered learning environments in STEM education have been tempered by a lack of professional development strategies that help faculty overcome common barriers to reform. This study investigated the impact that adopting a suite of student-centered teaching materials had on the teaching practices and beliefs of eight geoscience faculty at a variety of US institutions. Each instructor adopted 18 class lessons that were developed as part of the InTeGrate (Interdisciplinary Teaching about the Earth for a Sustainable Future) project into a semester-long course. The Teaching Practices Inventory (TPI) and Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP) were used to collect data on teaching practices whereas instructor beliefs were captured with the Teacher Beliefs Interview (TBI). Data were collected over three semesters, a control semester using traditional materials, a pilot semester using the new materials, and a final treatment semester. While the TPI survey showed no self-reported changes in the practices, RTOP observations recorded the incorporation of more student-centered teaching practices. TBI results confirm that most of the instructors also made at least moderate shifts toward more student-centered beliefs about teaching and learning. These findings demonstrate that the adoption of well-crafted, student-centered instructional materials can have a positive impact on both the teaching practices and beliefs of college faculty.

AB  - This article provides an introduction for the special issue of the "Journal of Science Education and Technology" focused on computational thinking (CT) from a disciplinary perspective. The special issue connects earlier research on what K-12 students can learn and be able to do using CT with the CT skills and habits of mind needed to productively participate in professional CT-integrated STEM fields. In this context, the phrase "disciplinary perspective" simultaneously holds two meanings: it refers to and aims to make connections between established K-12 STEM subject areas (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and newer CT-integrated disciplines such as computational sciences. The special issue presents a framework for CT integration and includes articles that illuminate what CT looks like from a disciplinary perspective, the challenges inherent in integrating CT into K-12 STEM education, and new ways of measuring CT aligned more closely with disciplinary practices. The aim of this special issue is to offer research-based and practitioner-grounded insights into recent work in CT integration and provoke new ways of thinking about CT integration from researchers, practitioners, and research-practitioner partnerships.

AB  - Most science curricular reform efforts are designed by administrators or science education experts. It is less common for teachers to work collaboratively across disciplines to create, implement, and disseminate an integrated STEM curriculum developed for noncollege-bound students that ended up being popular across student populations at the school. The integrated Geometry in Construction curriculum was developed 12 years ago and has since been adopted by over 425 schools across the United States. This intrinsic case study describes the experiences and perceptions of two high school teachers (one in mathematics and one in industrial science/engineering) as they achieved agency to initiate a deep and sustained reform effort. Drawing on the theory of teacher agency, the factors motivating the teachers to enact their beliefs about students and teaching are described. As a result of increased professional agency (driven by professional discontentment, willingness to take risks, and encouragement by mentors), these two teachers (a) cogenerated integrated engineering-math curriculum with one another and their students and (b) addressed the needs of their community for affordable housing.

AB  - Hasok Chang ("Sci Educ" 20:317-341, 2011) shows how the recovery of past experimental knowledge, the physical replication of historical experiments, and the extension of recovered knowledge can increase scientific understanding. These activities can also play an important role in both science and history and philosophy of science education. In this paper I describe the implementation of an integrated learning project that I initiated, organized, and structured to complement a course in history and philosophy of the life sciences (HPLS). The project focuses on the study and use of descriptions, observations, experiments, and recording techniques used by early microscopists to classify various species of water flea. The first published illustrations and descriptions of the water flea were included in the Dutch naturalist Jan Swammerdam's, "Historia Insectorum Generalis" (1669) ("Algemeene verhandeling van de bloedeloose dierkens." t'Utrrecht, Meinardus van Dreunen, ordinaris Drucker van d'Academie). After studying these, we first used the descriptions, techniques, and nomenclature recovered to observe, record, and classify the specimens collected from our university ponds. We then used updated recording techniques and image-based keys to observe and identify the specimens. The implementation of these newer techniques was guided in part by the observations and records that resulted from our use of the recovered historical methods of investigation. The series of HPLS labs constructed as part of this interdisciplinary project provided a space for students to consider and wrestle with the many philosophical issues that arise in the process of identifying an unknown organism and offered unique learning opportunities that engaged students' curiosity and critical thinking skills.

AB  - This study aims to explore students' argumentation and decision-making relating to an authentic socioscientific issue (SSI)--the problem of environmental toxins in fish from the Baltic Sea. A multi-disciplinary instructional module, designed in order to develop students' skills to argue about complex SSI, was successfully tested. Seven science majors in the final year of their upper secondary studies participated in this study. Their argumentation and decision-making processes were followed closely, and data were collected during multiple stages of the instructional module: group discussions were audio recorded, the participants wrote reports on their decision making, and postexercise interviews were conducted with individual students. The analysis focused on the skill of evaluation demonstrated by the students during the exercise and the relationships between the knowledge, values, and experiences that they used in their argumentation. Even though all of the students had access to the same information and agreed on the factual aspects of the issue, they came to different decisions. All of the students took counter-arguments and the limitations of their claims into account and were able to extend their claims where appropriate. However, their decisions differed depending on their background knowledge, values, and experiences (i.e., their intellectual baggage). The implication to SSI teaching and learning is discussed.

AB  - Combining mathematics and environmental issues may be a valuable way not only to increase environmental awareness of students but also provide real life context to the mathematics lessons. In this study, it was aimed to explore changes in the views of 5th grade students toward sustainability with the help of the tasks integrating environmental education and mathematics education contents. Based on this aim, as convenient sample, a fifth-grade classroom in a private school in Tukey selected and students attending to this classroom participated in the study. Environmental education issues and mathematical contents were integrated in students' tasks and these developed tasks were applied as a regular part of the teaching processes of this classroom. Before and after applications, semi structured pre-interviews were carried out with nine students randomly selected from the classroom and the data obtained from these interviews and researcher teacher's observations were analyzed qualitatively. The findings as the changes in students' views were combined under 3 categories; students' views about environmental problems; students' own individualized role in environmental problems and students' views towards integration of environmental education and mathematics. This study may provide valuable contributions both to the mathematics education and science education fields in this regard.

AB  - Striking differences between physics and biology have important implications for interdisciplinary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. The author is a physicist with interdisciplinary connections. The research group in which he works, the Center for Nonlinear Dynamics at the University of Texas at Austin, is converting into the physics department home for biological physics. Many of his collaborations have been with faculty in engineering. For the past 15 years, he has been codirector of the program at the University of Texas at Austin that prepares secondary science and mathematics teachers (UTeach, 2012). The future teachers take a course on scientific research he developed and deliver together with colleagues from biology, astronomy, chemistry, and biochemistry (Marder, 2011). This background naturally makes him an enthusiastic advocate of interdisciplinary education at the secondary and undergraduate levels. Yet at the same time, the author is worried by some features of what may be coming. These worries have to do with what can happen as educators are all lumped together under the heading of STEM.

AB  - Many current curricula, in going beyond traditional goals, increasingly foster creativity in science classrooms, declaring creativity a core skill of the 21st century. For enhancing creativity in science classrooms, the subject Arts is considered to offer a potential way from STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) to STEAM (STEM with Arts)). The Horizont-2020 project Creations prepared more than 100 creativity-enhancing STEAM modules based on the 5E instructional model. STEM subjects were mathematics, biology, physics, chemistry or technology, and often interdisciplinary for different school and class levels between the ages of nine and nineteen. All modules provided a social environment fostering creativity where students imagine, explore, experiment, test, manipulate, and speculate. Exemplarily, five modules including physics, math, and biology, were selected, for monitoring motivation and creativity. The first was measured on the level of career-motivation and self-efficacy, the latter focused on two sub-constructs: active cognition such as idea processing (ACT), and a mental state of creative immersion (FLOW). Subjects were a sample of 995 students (9-18 years). In summary, no gender impact or age effect appeared in any of the monitored variables. Participation intervened with Self-Efficacy and ACT, while Career Motivation or FLOW did not. Act as a cognitive variable associated with creativity might be more sensitive to changes, whereas Flow as a parameter measuring a state of mind related to emotion appears more stable. Path analysis supported the role of creativity for Career-Motivation by promoting Self-Efficacy. Conclusions for appropriate educational settings to foster STEAM environments are discussed.

AB  - Although there is considerable activity in developing assessment protocols for undergraduate learning, there are few established models for assessment of student progress in multidisciplinary doctoral-level graduate education. To resolve this impediment in tracking graduate student development, we created a simple assessment tool based on the concept of T competency that allows graduate students to articulate explicit learning goals in disciplinary and multidisciplinary research. Our instrument allows quantitative measurement of a student's self-perception of his/her knowledge and interest in multidisciplinary inquiry. We use our T assessment tool to measure graduate student progress in an NSF IGERT-funded graduate program in coastal ecosystem management. The T model provides us a nomenclature to articulate learning goals, a quantitative means to evaluate current and future learning targets and progress in reaching those targets, and gives us another measure of assessing overall graduate program effectiveness. Our T tool is an instrument that should have considerable utility in measuring knowledge and interest in multidisciplinary research across a range of disciplines and graduate programs.

AB  - We present two simple, one-dimensional, stochastic models that lead to a qualitative understanding of very complex systems from biology, nanoscience and social sciences. The first model explains the complicated dynamics of microtubules, stochastic cellular highways. Using the theory of random walks in one dimension, we find analytical expressions for certain physical quantities, such as the time dependence of the length of the microtubules, and diffusion coefficients. The second one is a stochastic adsorption model with applications in surface deposition, epidemics and voter systems. We introduce the "empty interval method" and show sample calculations for the time-dependent particle density. These models can serve as an introduction to the field of non-equilibrium statistical physics, and can also be used as a pedagogical tool to exemplify standard statistical physics concepts, such as random walks or the kinetic approach of the master equation.

AB  - Interdisciplinary teaching is a teaching method that is not as easy as other teaching methods to integrate into the everyday school schedule. This paper serves as an example and gives explanations on how this didactic approach can be applied. The lessons described were conducted successfully with a Year 11 class at a secondary school in which the subjects of physical education and biology were combined. Based on the performance of three athletic disciplines, namely sprinting, javelin throwing, and high jumping, the biological background, such as the identity and relationships of the muscles involved was discussed and elaborated on. As the curriculum for biology requires, the students were introduced to systems that explore biological phenomena by studying the relationships between structure and function. By combining the biological background with physical education, the students were able to evaluate their movement skills and learn more about concepts and strategies to perform their physical activities competently (consistent with ACARA, 2017a).

AB  - Since 2009, the U.S. National Science Foundation Directorate for Biological Sciences has funded Research Coordination Networks (RCN) aimed at collaborative efforts to improve participation, learning, and assessment in undergraduate biology education (UBE). RCN-UBE projects focus on coordination and communication among scientists and educators who are fostering improved and innovative approaches to biology education. When faculty members collaborate with the overarching goal of advancing undergraduate biology education, there is a need to optimize collaboration between participants in order to deeply integrate the knowledge across disciplinary boundaries. In this essay we propose a novel guiding framework for bringing colleagues together to advance knowledge and its integration across disciplines, the "Five 'C's' of Collaboration: Commitment, Collegiality, Communication, Consensus, and Continuity." This guiding framework for professional network practice is informed by both relevant literature and empirical evidence from community-building experience within the RCN-UBE Advancing Competencies in Experimentation-Biology (ACE-Bio) Network. The framework is presented with practical examples to illustrate how it might be used to enhance collaboration between new and existing participants in the ACE-Bio Network as well as within other interdisciplinary networks.

AB  - This paper contributes to a nascent conversation in environmental education (EE) research by using ethnographic data and extant theory to develop a feminist posthumanist political ecology of education for theorizing human-animal relations/relationships. Specifically, I (1) engage feminist methodologies and theories; (2) give epistemological and theoretical attention to nonhuman animals; and (3) address the field of EE's minimal engagement with the interdisciplinary research agenda of political ecology. The paper begins with a literature review examining how feminist and/or posthumanist scholars have theorized human-animal (or human-nature) relations/relationships. Next, I outline the conceptual frameworks guiding the analyses of ethnographic data I collected at Long Beach, California's Aquarium of the Pacific and follow with a brief overview of the study. I conclude by outlining the major tenets of this article's conceptual framework, which contributes to a growing conversation in EE regarding human-animal relations/relationships and lays the groundwork for other political ecologies of education.

AB  - Interdisciplinary curriculum development is challenging in the sense that materials from more than one discipline have to be integrated in a seamless manner. A faculty member has to develop expertise in multiple disciplines in order to teach an interdisciplinary course, or the course has to be team-taught. Both approaches are difficult to implement. There are administrative issues, such as proportional posting of expenditures across departmental budgets for the courses taught collaboratively, or courses with students from multiple departments. This paper describes the development and teaching of a sequence of bioinformatics related interdisciplinary courses for incorporation into undergraduate biology curricula. Three courses were developed with collaboration between the Departments of Biology and Computer Science at Tuskegee University. Each course contains contents from different subjects, traditionally considered to be virtually independent of each other. The courses have contents from biology, computer science, statistics, mathematics and biochemistry. The first two courses, Introduction to Bioscience Computing and Biological Algorithms & Data Structures, cover the computing and computer science fundamentals necessary for the informed use of bioinformatics tools. The third is an introductory course in bioinformatics. The focus was on teaching the effective use of bioinformatics tools, as compared to development of bioinformatics tools which is more relevant at the graduate level. Administrative issues encountered are also discussed. This work was supported by a NSF HBCU-UP grant.

AB  - "Computing in the Humanities," an undergraduate course for Computer Science Department majors and minors and Web Programming minors at New York University, represents a unique collaboration between the Computer Science Department and the University Archives. The course's final assignment required students to select, digitize, and contextualize materials from the Archives' collections in an interactive Web site. The design and implementation of the course incorporates four current and important trends in both disciplines. First, the professor and archivist worked closely together before and during the course, which served to integrate the archival research component into the core mission of the course. Second, the students' projects provided increased subject access and dynamic Web content to the repository and meaningful work to the students. Third, this course produced students who "bridge" the needs of humanists with the capabilities of technology. Fourth, this course illustrated the growing importance of Web programming and project-based courses in undergraduate computer science education. (Contains 3 footnotes and 28 notes.)

AB  - We describe and analyze a professional development (PD) model that involved a partnership among science, mathematics and education university faculty, science and mathematics coordinators, and middle school administrators, teachers, and students. The overarching project goal involved the implementation of interdisciplinary STEM Design Challenges (DCs). The PD model targeted: (a) increasing teachers' content and pedagogical content knowledge in mathematics and science; (b) helping teachers integrate STEM practices into their lessons; and (c) addressing teachers' beliefs about engaging underperforming students in challenging problems. A unique aspect involved low-achieving students and their teachers learning alongside each other as they co-participated in STEM design challenges for one week in the summer. Our analysis focused on what teachers came to value about STEM DCs, and the challenges in and affordances for implementing DCs. Two significant areas of value for the teachers were students' use of scientific, mathematical, and engineering practices and motivation, engagement, and empowerment by all learners. Challenges associated with pedagogy, curriculum, and the traditional structures of the schools were identified. Finally, there were four key affordances: (a) opportunities to construct a vision of STEM education; (b) motivation to implement DCs; (c) ambitious pedagogical tools; and, (d) ongoing support for planning and implementation.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to explore the holistic picture of sustainability curricula in Asian higher education. Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis was conducted based on Asian management education for sustainability in higher education. Online courses arrangement, teaching methods, instructors' educational background and cross-referencing data between triple bottom line and sustainability courses have been investigated. Findings: The paper provides empirical insights about the current state of sustainability education in Asia. The results show that there is an opportunity for interdisciplinary integration, as there are imbalanced sustainability courses offered by business, science and engineering schools. It also suggests that Asian universities should add an international connection and active promotion of sustainability education on their Web sites. Research limitations/implications: Findings are based on web-based sustainability-related courses. Future research could apply method of case study to do a deeper study. Practical implications: The paper provides an overview of Asian management education for sustainability and curricula analysis through our research, and that this will further assist in the development of interdisciplinary integration in Asian management education for sustainability. Originality/value: This paper is the first attempt to gain better understanding of sustainability-related courses offered in leading business/management colleges in Asia.

AB  - Combining the interdisciplinary studies (primarily humanities) literature with the content analysis of 129 successful National Science Foundation proposals written predominantly by science and engineering faculty members, the authors identify five categories of learning outcomes for interdisciplinary graduate education: disciplinary grounding, integration, teamwork, communication, and critical awareness. They identify important parallels between humanities-based descriptions of interdisciplinary integration and implicit graduate learning outcomes hinted at by engineering and science faculty who more frequently work in teams. Applying the lens of interdisciplinary studies (humanities) to science and engineering provides important depth and focus to engineering and science interdisciplinary learning outcomes, particularly in detailing integration processes.

AB  - This paper argues that the nonkilling political scientist Glenn D. Paige could be seen as an extraordinary peace educator. It will be organized through three words -- reading, writing and talisman. It begins with a brief discussion of the method used in understanding political scientist Glenn D. Paige's life as a teacher. Then, the author's 'reading' and 'writing' experiences, from taking courses with him, and writing a PhD dissertation under him, will be examined. The way in which political science education could perhaps be considered a form of peace education will be discussed. The concluding section on 'talisman' advances Paige's central idea of politics in terms of making decisions, especially to choose alternatives which could mitigate the killing effects and enhance nonkilling possibilities.

AB  - Library and information science (LIS) is highly interdisciplinary by nature and is affected by the incessant evolution of technologies. A recent study surveying research trends in the years 2002-6 at various information science departments worldwide has found that a clear trend was identified in Masters theses and doctoral dissertations of social aspects of information moving into the spotlight. The study found that only a third of the research that was tagged on the ProQuest Digital Dissertations database under either or both "Library Science" and "Information Science" was actually conducted at LIS departments. The current study aims to examine the remaining two thirds of these papers, conducted in non-LIS departments. This will contribute toward our understanding of the field and its future development. The research findings indicate that there is a relatively clear division of research topics between the studies conducted in various information studies departments and those conducted in other departments that study information. The main difference found is the opposite foci of LIS and non-LIS studies. While LIS scholars focus on the information user, other fields, headed by business administration, computer science, education and communication, focus on the system, on information technology, the information industry and the management of information.

The magazine is addressed to teachers of physics and, consequently, to grammar-school pupils/students. Its articles ranged, in general, from short texts taken from physical sciences to more specialized articles. During the period under consideration (1975-1977), i.e., after the fall (1974) of the military government (1967-1974) and the outset of the educational reform, the magazine's subjects changed, comprising interdisciplinary proposals in relation to the philosophy of physical and natural sciences, their history, their social usefulness, and their connections with non-scientific culture. Some new approaches concerned particularly school geography as a multidisciplinary field.

AB  - The development of problem solving skills is a shared goal in science, engineering, mathematics and technology education. In the applied sciences, problems are often open-ended and complex, requiring a multidisciplinary approach as well as new designs. In such cases, problem solving requires not only analytical capabilities, but also creativity and the ability to innovate. The development of an information system entails problem solving by means of design, hence creativity is integral to the task of an information systems (IS) professional. However, it appears that the teaching of creativity in IS programmes is under-researched and possibly neglected. This study investigates what is being done to foster creative ability of South African undergraduate IS students. At the same time, a theoretical framework for creativity teaching is developed. We find that the fostering of creative ability involves more than just the teaching of creativity techniques, and that creativity can be indirectly nurtured in multiple ways.

AB  - E-Learning is becoming an integral part of undergraduate medicine, with many curricula incorporating a number of online activities and resources, in addition to more traditional teaching methods. This study examines physical attendance, online activity, and examination outcomes in a first-year undergraduate medical program. All 358 students who completed the Alimentary System module within the first semester of the program were included, 30 of whom were repeating the year, and thus the module. This systems-based, multidisciplinary module incorporated didactic lectures, cadaveric small group tutorials and additional e-Learning resources such as online histology tutorials. Significant differences were demonstrated in physical attendance and utilization of online resources between repeating students and those participating in the module for the first time. Subsequent analyses confirmed that physical attendance, access of online lecture resources, and utilization of online histology tutorials were all significantly correlated. In addition, both physical attendance and utilization of online resources significantly correlated with summative examination performance. While nonattendance may be due to a variety of factors, our data confirm that significant differences exist in both physical attendance and online activity between new entrants and repeating students, such that all students repeating a module or academic year should be routinely interviewed and offered appropriate supports to ensure that they continue to engage with the program. While the development of complex algorithmic models may be resource intensive, using readily available indices from virtual learning environments is a straightforward, albeit less powerful, means to identify struggling students prior to summative examinations.

AB  - Today's children grow up surrounded by computers. They observe them, interact with them and, as a consequence, start forming conceptions of how they work and what they can do. Any constructivist approach to learning requires that we gain an understanding of such preconceived ideas and beliefs in order to use computers as learning tools in an effective and informed manner. In this paper, we present five such conceptions that children reportedly form about computers, based on an interdisciplinary literature review. We then evaluate how persistent these conceptions appear to be over time and in light of new technological developments. Finally, we discuss the relevance and implications of our findings for education in the contexts of conceptual pluralism and conceptual categorisation.

AB  - This paper draws on an initiative where we experienced being new, radical, and, from some viewpoints, dangerously progressive at Unitec--a Polytechnic/Institute of Technology in Aotearoa, New Zealand. The initiative was driven by a need to improve student experiences of interdisciplinary learning and teaching, and to develop a common semester for students transitioning to a bachelor degree programme, as well as a new suite of interdisciplinary qualifications at postgraduate level. This discussion paper is situated within a self-study paradigm befitting educational contexts, by drawing on the reflective narratives of three participants who held a range of different roles--and, hence, perspectives within the change process. Interpretations and implications are discussed using the lens of the "Inclusive Framework," to illustrate personal, professional, and political elements. Our overall aim is to add to current understandings of change within the higher education sector. However, this is a study of our own experiences and we are not making claims that we are in the possession of "truth", but, rather, we seek to identify aspects that may have relevance in other contexts. We conclude that navigating the next phase of transformative change in our context will involve seeking resolutions to key emerging questions. This includes exploring notions of multiple innovators, creating agile development environments in education and exploring the concept of time as multifaceted.

AB  - The primary objective of this study was to determine how experience in learning to teach scientific inquiry using a practical approach affected teacher's attitudes, evaluations of use of inquiry and their actual design of inquiry based instruction. The methodology included the use an approach incorporating inquiry methodology combined with a technology-infused and engineering rich approach called "Intelligent Robotics" to help teachers learn and use a new approach to teaching scientific inquiry. The findings showed that these teachers progressively moved from more teacher-centered thinking about teaching to student-centered thinking and actions incorporating scientific inquiry. They also worked together in designing an interdisciplinary inquiry curriculum, providing an effective alternative to traditional rigid standards based curriculum and teacher directed instruction.

AB  - Research concerning the basic course known as Foundations of Art and Design strengthens the pedagogical approach for K-16 art and design education. The version of Foundations introduced to America by Josef Albers, although hardly changed, is shown to have continued, timeless relevance. Next, a sequential, implicit logic is revealed in linking the literature of the originators' old intentions for the course, reflections by their students, and directions taken by later colleagues (particularly design scientists and the theorists addressing the current paradigm combining aspects of art, design, mathematics and science education), revealing some limitless, possible new dimensions. The first focus of this article points to the foundations course as a common denominator for the assimilation of complex new material through aesthetic play, paving the way for new cultural forms. A second theme begins to intertwine literature from many interdisciplinary fields, revealing a profound and deeply rooted pedagogical underpinning, accessible to art and design researchers and educators to aid with their move toward future transformation.

AB  - Langara College, as one of the leading undergraduate institutions in the province of British Columbia (BC), offers the "Applied Science for Engineering" two-year diploma program as well as the "Engineering Transfer" two-semester certificate program. Three project-based courses are offered as part of the two-year diploma program in Applied Science (APSC) and Computer Science (CPSC) departments: "APSC 1010--Engineering and Technology in Society", "CPSC 1090--Engineering Graphics", and "CPSC 1490--Applications of Microcontrollers", with CPSC 1090 and CPSC 1490 also part of the Engineering Transfer curriculum. Although the goals, scopes, objectives, and evaluation criteria of these courses are different, the main component of all three courses is a group-based technical project. Engineering students have access to Langara College's Makerspace for the hands-on component of their project. Makerspaces expand experiential learning opportunities and allows students to gain a skillset outside the traditional classroom. This paper begins with a detailed review of the maker movement and the impact of makerspace in higher education. Different forms of makerspace and the benefits of incorporating them on first-year students' creativity, sense of community, self-confidence, and entrepreneurial skills are discussed. This paper introduces Langara's engineering program and its project-based design courses. Langara's interdisciplinary makerspace, its goals and objectives, equipment, and some sample projects are introduced in this paper in detail. We then explain how the group-project component of APSC 1010, CPSC 1090, and CPSC 1490 are managed and how using makerspace improves students' performance in such projects. In conclusion, the paper describes the evaluation of learning outcomes via an anonymous student survey.
