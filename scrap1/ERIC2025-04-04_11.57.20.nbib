AB  - This paper relates the story of two professors that have made a bridge between the two cultures, science and humanities. They teach a humanities course together in which they explore the nature of the two cultures, their differences and their commonalities. The processes of team-building and planning produced five heuristic questions for the course around which the paper is organized: (1) Have science and the humanities always been separate cultures?; (2) What are the respective worldviews out of which scientists and humanists work?; (3) Can the two cultures be bridged?; (4) What sort of dialogue can bring about that connection?; and (5) Can students understand and become participants in that dialogue? The paper describes this team teaching experience from its conceptual beginnings through the actualization of those concepts. In it, the authors will talk about "doing" the course, what they have learned from teaching it, and how they have changed from the experience.

AB  - While some textbooks still teach students that there is one scientific process that must be rigidly followed, this stagnant portrayal of the process of science can lead students to think that science and scientists are quite boring. Through integrating visual art and microscopy, students learn about the creativity of scientists and begin to appreciate the role of intuition, creativity, and culture in the science field. This article presents the photomicrographic works of art of two marine scientists, Martina Doblin and Lisa Drake, from their microscopy work. It also discusses the things that science teachers should do in teaching integrated visual art and microscopy to their students and motivating them to learn more about their microworld. By sharing the photomicrographic images created by two research scientists, students experience a realistic portrayal of creative individuals who collect and interpret evidence, communicate findings, and collaborate with each other to create consensus. Teachers can reenergize their students' interest in studying the microworld while exposing them to the nature of science, the variety of ways science can be applied, and the diversity of scientists in the workplace.

AB  - In this article, the authors show how oceanography can enlighten and energize the teaching of middle- and high-school social studies on a grade-by-grade basis, and they describe "hooks" from oceanography that will heighten students' interest in various social studies topics. They base the article on their own experiences--as a university-level geography professor who teaches oceanography and world regional geography and as a middle- and high-school social studies teacher who is pursuing a Ph.D. in geography education. They focus on factors associated with the changing role of geography in U.S. schools. They review the professional literature to determine the amount of cross-over between oceanography and social studies and use the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) from the Texas Education Agency (2001), which is similar in many respects to other state standards, as a means to analyze social studies instruction and learning objectives on a grade-by-grade basis. They provide examples from each grade's curriculum to show how oceanography can enliven and complement instruction. They also show how such an approach can help students understand that local problems are often a part of larger world problems and how an understanding of science can help them better understand social science issues, such as environmental problems, which may be local or global in scale.

AB  - There is growing awareness of the need to equip students to think through the ethical implications of developments in biology. We describe an exercise in which students work in teams to produce websites about current controversial issues within the subject. Participants report a significant improvement in their knowledge of bioethics and acquisition of new generic skills. Additionally, we note not only a broadening of their consciousness about such issues, but also an increase in their use of appropriate scientific terminology. This web-authoring activity could readily be adapted for use with students in a broader range of disciplines at both tertiary and secondary level. (Contains 4 tables and 1 box.)

AB  - The need for a borderless learning experience is apparent for many subjects, but is particularly important for the science major. We are living in an era when a strand of hair or piece of gum can identify a criminal, and the blueprint of our genes has been mapped out completely. Continuing to educate students merely in the "how to" of science technique--rather than the "what for" or "consequences of" the science--is not providing the whole picture. Instead of merely extending the content of each topic, science classes should incorporate any and all information needed to completely understand how each subject works in real-world terms. Support for the concept of an "integrated science" philosophy may be drawn from four main observations: (1) statistics show that most science graduates come from liberal arts institutions; (2) much of the subject matter of science is poorly understood without recourse to a discussion of social policy, economics, and cultural disparities; (3) the loss of many otherwise capable science majors may be linked to an inability to connect with the rigid practice of science; and (4) continuing to divide the curriculum sharply between science and non-science issues may help make students less civically minded in the long term. This article describes the inspiration behind the authors' teaching methods in upper-level science courses, and the strategies she has implemented to make her science courses borderless.

AB  - This paper illustrates an approach used to enhance student learning outcomes in a combined cross-listed Systems Analysis and Design (SA&D) course and examines benefits perceived by students through analysis of assessment and students feedback. The SA&D course is a required course in both the Management Information Systems (MIS) major and the Applied Computer Science (ACS) major. The SA&D course was taught to a combined cross-listed class of MIS and ACS students over a period of two years. Two strategies were adopted to make the course a worthwhile learning experience for students in both majors. The first was to extend the scope of the course within the System Development Life Cycle spectrum to include planning before analysis and implementation (prototype) after the design. The second strategy was to have a running group project as the main assessment (accounting for 50% of the course grade) where each group had at least one student from each of the two majors. These groups carried out a system development project with four phased deliverables: system proposal, requirements specifications, design specifications and a working prototype with emphasis on user interfaces. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of how the combined cross-listed course was designed, delivered and refined for future offerings. It also examines the value of teamwork using students' feedback. The students' experiences were studied over a two-year period. Two different instruments were used to gather feedback and to analyze the effectiveness of the combined cross-listed strategy: a qualitative study and a quantitative study concerning student perception on learning enhancement. Initially a qualitative study with open-ended questions was carried out to identify areas for improvement and to examine how well these strategies had worked. The three problems identified were lack of sufficient time for the last phase (working prototype), lack of time for team meetings, and lack of a comprehensive example case. These problems were addressed in subsequent course offerings. The study also revealed that about 80 percent of the students liked working in a mixed group setting on the extended course project, and 75 percent of the students indicated that working on the mixed group project offered them real-world experience. Encouraged by such positive observations, a quantitative study was conducted on students' perceptions concerning specific learning outcomes for carrying out the various system development tasks and the development of skills (including soft skills) among and between the two majors. The results indicated that the students from both majors perceived more than average learning outcomes and skills development. It also indicated that while the ACS students claimed to have learned relatively more on feasibility analysis and information gathering, the MIS students claimed to have learned relatively more on user interface design and architectural design. However, the results indicated that the perceived differences in the learning outcomes between the two majors were not significant. The analysis confirms an enhanced learning outcome for both the ACS and the MIS majors due to knowledge sharing made available through teamwork. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - This article describes a one-year study of 120 fifth grade students whose teachers participated in a program entitled Project SMILE (Science and Mathematics Integrated with Literary Experiences). The purpose of the study was to determine the extent to which the classroom implementation of Project SMILE positively influenced the classroom environment and student attitudes toward reading, writing and mathematics. This was accomplished by, first, facilitating a series of professional development workshops with the teachers and, subsequently, asking these teachers to use the strategies with their students in their elementary school classrooms. The research represents one of the relatively few studies that have employed learning environment dimensions as criteria of effectiveness in the evaluation of educational innovations. Methodologically, our study supported previous research that successfully combined qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection. The learning environment and attitude scales exhibited satisfactory internal consistency reliability and discriminant validity and, additionally, the actual form of most learning environment scales was capable of differentiating between the perceptions of students in different classrooms. The implementation of SMILE was found to have a positive impact on the students of the teachers who participated in the inservice program in that students' attitudes to mathematics and reading improved and there was congruence between students' actual and preferred classroom environment on the scales of satisfaction and difficulty. As well, prior research was replicated in that students' satisfaction was greater in classrooms with a more positive learning environment, especially in terms of student cohesiveness. Finally, qualitative data-gathering methods were used to construct a case study of the mathematics classes of a teacher who attended the SMILE professional development. This case study supported and illuminated the results from the questionnaire survey concerning the effectiveness of Project SMILE in terms of student attitudes and classroom environment.
