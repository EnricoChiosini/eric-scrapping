AB  - Art provides students a way to visually represent their scientific knowledge and at the same time helps teachers assess student understanding. Examining a drawing allows teachers to scrutinize students' mental model of a science concept. Science can be described as a continuing process of discovering the order and recurring patterns in nature; therefore, science that involves action and the act of creating artistic representations models the very nature of the scientific enterprise. Curriculum integration of art and science makes the connection not only between the disciplines but also more importantly between students and the concepts of science. In this article, the author emphasizes the important role that art plays in the science classroom, and presents examples of science/art activities. (Contains 2 figures.)

AB  - Forestry and agricultural education programs need to increase their public communication and cross-disciplinary activities. In this article we present a technique, Cross-Disciplinary Peer Education (CDPE), which allowed forestry students to teach student peers from other disciplines about basic forestry principles. Cross-Disciplinary Peer Education is an innovative way to give natural resource and agriculture students (peer educators) the opportunity to educate students from other disciplines (peer learners). In our exploration of CDPE we found (i) peer learners gained exposure to different disciplines and perspectives of the world, and (ii) peer educators improved their communication skills. The primary challenge of CDPE is the additional time required by faculty instructors to prepare for the CDPE experience. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - The role of motivation and collaboration in STEM learning and performance is paramount. A learning community represents an educational approach that can engage students in learning in a motivated, thoughtful, active, and collaborative way. The focus of this article is on the nature of students' interest, attitudes, learning experiences and motivation in STEM as a result of participating in linked classes as part of the Learning Communities for STEM Academic Achievement (LCSAA) initiative at two historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Quantitative and qualitative data demonstrate a positive influence of learning communities on students' attitudes, learning experiences and intrinsic motivation in STEM.

AB  - The history of mathematics and science integration in American schools is a continuum which runs from math for math's sake to science for science's sake. While examples of the integration of process skills are common, integration of content is not. Presents two lessons developed around radioactive decay and efficiency. Suggests that changes in preservice and in-service teacher training must occur for content integration. (Author/SJR)

AB  - Traditionally, universities focus primarily on instructionist teaching. Such an understanding has been criticized from theoretical and practical points of view. We believe that "socio-cultural theories of learning" and the concepts of "social capital" and "social creativity" hold considerable promise as a theoretical base for the repositioning of universities in the knowledge society. To illustrate our assumption, we provide case studies from the University of Colorado and the University of Siegen. These cases indicate how approaches to community-based learning can be integrated into a curriculum of applied computer science. We also discuss the role these didactical concepts can play within a practice-oriented strategy of regional innovation.

AB  - Constructivist, hands-on, inquiry-based, science activities may have a curative potential that could be valuable in a psychological assistance programme for child victims of violence and war. To investigate this idea, pilot sessions were performed in an orphanage located in Ruhengeri, Rwanda, with seven young adults and two groups of 11 children aged from 9 to 16 years. Despite a number of imperfections in this attempt, significant observations have been made. First, a sound communication was established with all, even with the young adults who at the beginning were not as enthusiastic as the children. Furthermore, some children, originally isolated, silent and sad, displayed a high degree of happiness during the activities, and an overall increasing positive change of attitude. In addition, they appropriated well some principles of experimental science. This suggests that a joint development of science literacy and joy may be an interesting approach, both in education and therapy. (Contains 1 table.)
