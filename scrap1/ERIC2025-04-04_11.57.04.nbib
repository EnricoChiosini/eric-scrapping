AB  - The purpose of this investigation is to examine how teacher candidates create and teach lesson plans that include trade books and the 5E model of inquiry science. Specifically, this study examines how elementary school teacher candidates, enrolled in a science methods course, intended to use trade books to teach interdisciplinary science and English/Language Arts lessons using the 5E Model of Instruction (Bybee, 1997). Inductive qualitative analysis reveals that science trade books can be used to increase the amount of class time spent on science. Implications for elementary pre-service teacher preparation programs are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to present theory, practice and original research findings to support the proposition that broad enquiry and problem-based learning (EPBL) approaches provide an appropriate pedagogical lens for sustainability educators to develop the knowledge and skills needed to work effectively within mission-oriented innovation policy (MIP) environments. Design/methodology/approach: The research study comprised four elements, each of which used different research methods. The first element involved a literature review mapping the synergies between MIP and EPBL; the second element piloted the use of EPBL for undergraduate modules related to sustainability challenges; the third element involved external stakeholders in the co-creation of a postgraduate programme that brought together innovation and sustainability, with EPBL fundamental to the design and development; the fourth element curated and comparatively analysed international cases of EPBL in the context of MIP, and sustainability challenges in particular, highlighting the versatility of EPBL and the importance of creativity in EPBL design and implementation. Findings: The systematic literature review reveals synergies between the key features of EPBL and defining characteristics of MIP, indicating the relevance of applying EPBL to support MIP. Two in situ pilots generated 13 recommendations on the benefits and operational challenges of applying EPBL. These recommendations informed the design and development of a postgraduate programme, involving a transdisciplinary consultation process with key industrial and societal stakeholders. Comparative analysis of four international case studies describing EPBL applied in practice in different international settings show there is no "one size fits all". Instead, the application of EPBL to different sustainability challenges and for different learner groups demonstrates the versatility of the pedagogical approach and the creativity of the sustainability educators. Originality/value: A discourse around the appropriate pedagogical methods and teaching/learning practice to equip the current and future workforce with the knowledge and skills to respond to MIP and global sustainability challenges is nascent but emerging. This paper makes a scientific and practical contribution to the discourse. The authors show how EPBL can underpin the design of programmes to provide learners with the knowledge and skills to support organisations working effectively within an MIP context, especially addressing sustainability challenges. The authors provide recommendations for educators seeking to embed EPBL within their curriculum and call for external stakeholders to proactively engage with educators to co-create programmes with context-specific outcomes.

AB  - Adolescents are considered as a nutritionally vulnerable subgroup because of their alimentary behaviours. Considering that alimentary habits are strongly influenced by knowledge about digestion, an experiment was conducted with aim to determine whether conceptual understanding and functionalization of this knowledge can be improved by the interdisciplinary teaching approach. The experiment encompassed 258 students attending the fourth year of high school. No statistically significant difference in the level of the previously acquired chemistry, biology and physics knowledge concerning digestion between the two groups was determined on the pre-test. Conversely, the students in the experimental group significantly outperformed those in the control group on the post-test that required a deep understanding and the application of knowledge about digestion in solving real-life problems. Therefore, it was concluded that high-school teachers can be advised to apply the interdisciplinary teaching approach in order to improve their students' knowledge about this process.

AB  - Learning goals and objectives are a key part of instruction, informing curricular design, assessment, and learning. These goals and objectives are also applied at the programmatic level, with program learning outcomes (PLOs) providing insight into the skills that undergraduate biology programs intend for their students to master. PLOs are mandated by all major higher education accreditation agencies and play integral roles in programmatic assessment. Despite their importance, however, there have not been any prior attempts to characterize PLOs across undergraduate biology programs in the United States. Our study reveals that many programs may not be using PLOs to communicate learning goals with students. We also identify key themes across these PLOs and differences in skills listed between institution types. For example, some "Vision & Change" core competencies (e.g., interdisciplinary nature of science; connecting science to society; quantitative reasoning) are highlighted by a low percentage of programs, while others are shared more frequently between programs. Similarly, we find that biology programs at 4-year institutions likely emphasize PLOs relating to computational skills and research more than at 2-year institutions. We conclude by discussing implications for how to best use PLOs to support student learning, assessment, and curricular improvements.

AB  - Purpose: This article contributes to the discussion of teaching migration in upper primary school by examining teachers' didactical choices concerning specialized knowledge and pupils' previous knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: The approach is practice-based design research, in which meetings with teachers and focus group interviews with ten- to twelve-year-old pupils are analysed in relation to educational practice and exemplary teaching. Findings: Teachers expanded concept of migration developed through discussions of specialized knowledge in relation to pupils' previous knowledge contributes to a more qualified migration education. Migration can be taught from a perspective or in thematic interdisciplinary projects. Migration biographies as well as using stories, pictures, and affective dimensions, can make the abstract concepts become concrete when reconstruction of migration in teaching. Practical implications: This addresses issues of continuous education in social studies for teachers and the need for collaborative platforms.

AB  - Cheminformatics is a widely used interdisciplinary field that is important for many chemistry areas. Cheminformatics skills are necessary for dealing with a large amount of chemical information and are considered essential for various tasks such as data analysis, visualization, storage, etc. This paper presents the basic cheminformatics chemistry semester-length course for first-year chemistry students, organized at the Novosibirsk State University. Students in the course learn literature and structural databases, search engines, chemical structure drawing and representation, graphing software, text formatting, scientific writing, and report representation. The course could be replicated as an entire course in chemical informatics or could be used as separate modules in other courses. We describe the face-to-face course and the adaptation to an online teaching model during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The students' and lecturers' feedback about the course program and results are also presented. We hope that this work can assist faculty members in teaching cheminformatics.

AB  - Although Machine Learning (ML) is found practically everywhere, few understand the technology behind it. This presents new challenges to extend computing education by including ML concepts in order to help students to understand its potential and limits and empowering them to become creators of intelligent solutions. Therefore, we developed an introductory course to teach basic ML concepts, such as fundamentals of neural networks as well as limitations and ethical concerns in alignment with the K-12 Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence. It also teaches the application of these concepts, by guiding the students to develop a first classification model of recycling trash images using Google Teachable Machine. In order to promote ML education, the interactive course is available online in Brazilian Portuguese to be used as an extracurricular course or in an interdisciplinary way as part of science classes covering recycling topics. The course was applied and evaluated through a series of exploratory case studies with a total of 108 middle and high school students. The results of the evaluation show that middle and high school students were able to understand ML concepts and develop an image classification model. No substantial difference with regard to the educational stage, gender and instructional mode was observed. The course was also perceived as an enjoyable learning experience motivating students to learn more about ML.

AB  - This activity report describes two cases of Language teaching for degree students in the University of Oulu with new pedagogical approaches aiming towards authentic working life skills. Co-creation, collaborative learning and cooperation across borders are the building blocks for these innovative language teaching projects. Case 1 describes Entrepreneurial Language Studies in English and Swedish courses, co-created with the Ministry of Culture and Education Key Projects, which aim for fostering entrepreneurial culture and creating entrepreneurial learning environments at universities. Case 2 is about Teaching English and Course Cooperation in English language between the students of Information Processing Science in Finland and Russia. In both of these cases, students have been challenging themselves with new ways to learn the language and at the same time acquire important skills for working life, virtual learning, presentations, communication, problem solving and business idea creation. What unites these cases is the emphasis on authentic language learning, creativity and self-efficacy. Because career paths today are increasingly complex, multidisciplinary and diverse, the ability to adapt, innovate and be flexible is vital in evolving and collaborative working environments.

AB  - Although researchers have argued that textbooks should be customized to local cultures and experiences, they rarely are. Ciencia Puerto Rico, a non-profit group interested in promoting science literacy and education among Latino(a)s/Hispanics, identified a need to provide schools with culturally relevant materials. The result was the publication of the book "¡Ciencia Boricua! Ensayos y anécdotas del científico puertorro," an anthology of short, multidisciplinary science essays written by Puerto Rican scientists to develop awareness of Puerto Rican science and scientists. The purposes of this manuscript are (a) to provide evidence of instances of contextualization and cultural relevance in "¡Ciencia Boricua!," and (b) to determine the extent to which the use of "¡Ciencia Boricua!" and related activities changed the perception toward science of 57 elementary and middle school students enrolled in a public school in Puerto Rico, and which contextualized science activities students preferred. The results showed that the contextualized activities improved the perception about science in many children, particularly boys. Students preferred activities with more interactivity, like presenting their science posters during Closing Night, visiting a science laboratory, and receiving guest scientists at the school. Results showcase a successful strategy for developing culturally relevant and contextualized science education resources.

AB  - Contribution: Using threshold concepts as the framework for curriculum design, a project on neural network methods for solving differential equations is presented, with a rich set of transformative concepts from mathematics and computer science. Projects of this kind complement a typical curriculum with expertise that is crucial for critique and fundamental development of modern machine learning. Background: The curricula of many schools of mathematics and computer science present a relatively shallow introduction to the other subject. Student projects, on the other hand, provide an effective environment for interdisciplinary research between the two disciplines. Intended Outcomes: Providing students from computer science and mathematics the opportunity to obtain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the other subject, beyond the confines of the school curriculum. Application Design: The project contains tasks that require acquisition, not just of knowledge, but also of effective strategies and mental models, relevant to a set of transformative concepts from both disciplines. The tasks require a spectrum of activities, ranging from rigorous theoretical work to coding. Findings: Although the theory of threshold concepts needs further development, the existing paradigms provide a helpful framework for curriculum design. The continuous formative assessment proved effective in monitoring the participants' journeys through the liminal state.

AB  - Twenty-five years ago, the aspirational vision of a newly formed national SENCER initiative led one of the authors (Wood) to initiate a long-term relationship between the Smithsonian Institution and George Mason University, involving a residential, immersive approach to education focused on biodiversity conservation. In the Smithsonian-Mason Semesters, the authors made progress by transforming the curriculum and incorporating active learning around real-world problems with an interdisciplinary focus. Mason students began discovering ways to become knowledgeable about societies and, consequently, the Earth's capacious problems, through immersion in the complex realities of living in the Anthropocene. At Mason, the authors have grown wiser about incorporating TEK (Traditional Ecological Knowledge) and Indigenous thinking and values into education for all students. Using a holistic approach, the authors have hired Indigenous faculty, built an interactive community with students and local tribes, and collaboratively developed research and education opportunities. To date, nine deliverables have been produced and presented to the Chickahominy Tribal Council. These include biodiversity surveys, GIS maps important for planning related to food insecurity and environmental contamination, and cultural information useful for repairing eco-kinship relationships to promote universal healing.

AB  - This study explored teachers' conceptualizations of integrated computational modeling in secondary physics by exposing twelve experienced physics teachers to programming and then analyzing interview responses. Responses revealed that teachers fell along a spectrum of disciplinary boundary-stretching mentalities. This paper presents a preliminary conceptual framework for exploring both horizontal (interdisciplinary) and vertical (intradisciplinary) boundary stretching, as well as for identifying bounded mentalities as teachers consider integration. Horizontal boundary stretchers envisioned opportunities to use computational modeling to shift their curriculum or pedagogical approaches in physics to help students enhance skills underlying multiple fields, while vertical boundary stretchers considered how computing might allow students to explore physics concepts more deeply. Teachers with more boundary-stretching indicators at the outset of an integrated curriculum development workshop were more likely to persist in the implementation of computational modeling-integrated materials in their physics classrooms than those who expressed more bounded thinking. These findings emphasize the importance of considering teachers' perceptions about how their own science discipline is connected to similar fields and provide implications about how to identify potential adopters of innovative teaching approaches.

AB  - Introducing students to a multidisciplinary research laboratory presents challenges in terms of learning specific technical skills and concepts but also with respect to integrating different technical elements to form a coherent picture of the research. Here we present a multidisciplinary series of experiments we have developed in the Electronic, Optical, and Nano Materials group at Sandia National Laboratories to introduce students to essential experimental methods and concepts spanning thin film synthesis, crystallography, electrochemistry, and optical spectroscopy. With minimal assistance from a qualified instructor, students apply a sol-gel method to synthesize electrochromic tungsten oxide (WO[subscript3]) thin films and evaluate their performance with electrochemistry, UV-vis spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. We find that the color changing WO[subscript3] films capture the students' attention, are technologically relevant, and make excellent materials platforms for multidisciplinary research as they invite investigation with a range of laboratory techniques. The variety of experimental methods combined here challenges the students to correlate the interplay between structure, processing, and properties central to materials science. The modular nature of this experiment set permits it to be tailored to the time constraints of individual students and also allows it to be applied to upper-level materials science or chemistry laboratories.

AB  - The underrepresentation of Black Americans in physics has been persistent for so long that it seems to have constrained physics educators' collective imagination when it comes to conceptualizing and pursuing equity in physics teaching and learning. Drawing on a teacher research study that foregrounds justice-centered physics teaching, this article pushes past the "equity as access" narrative toward more expansive visions of equity and justice by reimagining physics education as a liberatory praxis. Accordingly, this study explores the complexities that emerged while expanding the boundaries of physics learning to embrace a justice-centered curriculum through a Youth Participatory Science (YPS) project. Taught in the context of a freshman physics course at an urban public high school, this YPS project engaged students in designing solar energy systems for an African-American community historically harmed by environmental racism. Critically evaluating curricular documents, I juxtaposed the traditional goals of physics learning with respect to definitions of community needs and assets. Simultaneously, I investigated the ways in which canonical physics knowledge dialectically interacts with interdisciplinary knowledge throughout the defining, investigating, and intervening phases of the YPS cycle. Throughout this process, I considered how physics learning provides opportunities to either reproduce or transform existing power relations within the sociopolitical and environmental schema of the community. The critical understandings constructed from this study frame what it takes to repurpose physics teaching and learning for environmental justice, specifically emphasizing the agentic pedagogical and curricular decisions teachers must negotiate to transform physics education for liberatory purposes.

AB  - This article details the aim, development, and implementation of the Chemistry-Genetics Course Collaborative (CGCC), a cotaught offering of a human genetics course with an honors introductory chemistry course. The CGCC was formed to fully integrate the two courses, along with the associated chemistry lab, to create an interdisciplinary scientific community among the students and their professors. The design of the courses was purposefully aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards, incorporating its interwoven strands of disciplinary core ideas, scientific practices, and crosscutting concepts. This article represents Part I of the research and contains the original interdisciplinary plan for the semester, along with the revised schedule after repeated, unified, and purposeful attempts by both faculty members to encourage students to buy into the course design were largely unsuccessful. Detailed descriptions of course assessments and rubrics, issues to be considered in designing such a nontraditional course structure, and reflections on the experience of implementing one are also included. Part II of the research, to be published separately, will focus on the analysis of assessment, attitude, and interview data.

AB  - Practitioners in the field of pharmacy are often confronted with ill-structured problems. Specifically, pharmacists are tasked with making patient-specific recommendations that are both safe and effective, which requires combining knowledge from the biomedical, behavioral, and pharmaceutical sciences. Given the dynamic nature of pharmacy as a profession, the field has begun to explore learning strategies that go beyond mere content coverage to strategies that better support higher-order learning outcomes. One of these approaches is problem-based learning (PBL). While studies have focused on how to support PBL to improve learning outcomes, the role of assessment is often overlooked. Further exploration is thus needed since assessment plays a pivotal role in teaching and learning. This Voices paper will explore this idea within a larger context; we will also share the experience of how a subject matter expert (SME) worked with a team of instructional designers (IDs) to revise an existing course to more explicitly employ PBL and thus adopt an inquiry-based mindset needed for complex clinical decision making. Given the inherent challenges of assessment in PBL, further discussion will be focused on how to (a) design ill-structured problems, (b) align assessments to the PBL curriculum, and (c) how to hold students accountable in cases where a traditional grade is not attached.

AB  - In response to a desire to strengthen the economy, educational settings are emphasizing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curriculum and programs. Yet, because of the narrow approach to STEM, educational leaders continue to call for a more balanced approach to teaching and learning, which includes the arts, design, and humanities. This desire created space for science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education, a transdisciplinary approach that focuses on problem-solving. STEAM-based curricula and STEAM-themed schools are appearing all over the globe. This growing national and global attention to STEAM provides an opportunity for teacher education to explore the ways in which teachers implement STEAM practices, examining the successes and challenges, and how teachers are beginning to make sense of this innovative teaching practice. The purpose of this paper is to examine the implementation of STEAM teaching practices in science and math middle school classrooms, in hopes to provide research-based evidence on this emerging topic to guide teacher educators.

AB  - The acquisition of both transversal and specific competences cannot be achieved using conventional methodologies. New methodologies must be applied that promote the necessary competences for proper professional development. Interdisciplinary projects can be a suitable tool for competence-based learning. A priori, this might be complicated, as subjects are traditionally studied at the university level in isolated compartments, with a fragmented structure. Taking advantage of the creation of new degree programs in Mechanical Engineering and Electronic Engineering and Industrial Automaton, in the 2010-11 academic year we decided to add an interdisciplinary project (IP) to our teaching methodology. The importance of this project lies in the fact that it requires the participation of all the courses in all the academic years in the degree program. The present article explains the methodology used in the interdisciplinary project and how it was implemented in the first year of the Mechanical Engineering and Electronic Engineering and Industrial Automaton degree programs. Furthermore, an evaluation is conducted of all four years of the interdisciplinary project, revealing the main problems with its execution and how they have been addressed.

AB  - Data science is a highly interdisciplinary field that comprises various principles, methodologies, and guidelines for the analysis of data. The creation of appropriate curricula that use computational tools and teaching activities is necessary for building skills and knowledge in data science. However, much of the literature about data science curricula focuses on the undergraduate university level. In this study, we developed an introductory data science curriculum for an out of school enrichment program aimed at middle grade learners (ages 11-13). We observed how the participants in the program (n = 11) learned data science practices through the combination of nonprogramming activities and programming activities using the language R. The results revealed that participants in the program were able to investigate statistical questions of their creation, perform data analysis using statistics and the creation of data visuals, make meaning from their results, and communicate their findings. These results suggest that a series of learner-centered nonprogramming and programming activities using R can facilitate the learning of data science skills for middle-school age students.

AB  - Aesthetic education can be integrated into students' everyday lives and into different learning areas. Its integration into science education is also valued in schools. Using mixed methods, this study investigated young children's science and aesthetic learning in a science aesthetic thematic curriculum in a preschool classroom in Taiwan. The participants were two preschool teachers and 24 five-year-old children. Data sources included the children's pre-test and post-test assessments, observations, interviews, children's worksheets and artwork, and teaching reflection notes. The preschool teachers applied Dewey's aesthetic experience to organise the thematic curriculum. The results showed that the curriculum had significant positive influences on the children's science cognitive abilities and aesthetic abilities. Most of the children increased their interest in science learning. This study provides a lens through which to examine children's science and aesthetic learning in a thematic curriculum, and also a reference for early childhood science education.

AB  - Dissection of bodies provided by donors continues to be utilized as a critical part of medical education. It also represents a rite of passage that socializes students to prepare them for the stress that comes with working in a clinical environment as a medical professional. Just as proper guidance in acquiring technical skills is critical in anatomy education, there is an important need for proper emotional guidance throughout the human dissection process. A pilot curriculum was developed by an interdisciplinary faculty team to emotionally prepare students for their first visit to the anatomy laboratory. Students were first-year foundation premedical students who had expressed an interest in visiting the laboratory. Pre- and post-visit surveys were conducted to explore students' emotional responses to a first visit to the anatomy laboratory and their utilization of coping strategies. The survey findings show an overwhelming favorable feeling in anticipation of the human gross anatomy laboratory visit. About 20% of the students experienced anxiety at the anticipation of the laboratory visit, but only 5.3% experienced anxiety during the visit. The decrease in the number of students experiencing anxiety may be attributed to the interventions introduced before and during the visit. Talking with a close friend was the main coping strategy utilized by 63% of students experiencing fear or anxiety during and after the laboratory visit. The findings from this program evaluation provide a better understanding of student emotional preparedness and utilization of coping strategies, which may help prepare and guide future students for the dissection experience.

AB  - This article presents the Data Science Ethos Lifecycle, a tool for engaging responsible workflow developed by an interdisciplinary team of social scientists and data scientists working with the Academic Data Science Alliance. The tool uses a data science lifecycle framework to engage data science students and practitioners with the ethical dimensions of their practice. The lifecycle supports practitioners to increase awareness of how their practice shapes and is shaped by the social world and to articulate their responsibility to public stakeholders. We discuss the theoretical foundations from the fields of Science, Technology and Society, feminist theory, and critical race theory that animate the Ethos Lifecycle and show how these orient the tool toward a normative commitment to justice and what we call the "world-making" view of data science. We introduce four conceptual lenses--positionality, power, sociotechnical systems, and narratives--that are at work in the Ethos Lifecycle and show how they can bring to light ethical and human issues in a real-world data science project.

AB  - Ethnomathematics, STEAM Education, and the Globalized Approach are articulated to analyze mathematical connections in daily practices. For this, the networking strategies were considered (understand the theoretical approaches; contrast-compare; coordinate-combine; synthesize-local integration). In the coordination and comparison, the complementarities between the approaches were evidenced and based on these, an empirical phenomenon was analyzed on the connections in daily practices carried out by five artisans who worked in the elaboration of kites, cabinets, masks, and drawers, agriculture, and masonry. From the integration strategy, three results were identified: (i) intra-disciplinary connections, which make it possible to present mathematics as an integrated whole, rather than as a set of isolated knowledge; (ii) interdisciplinary connections, between knowledge from different disciplines that feed into each other; and (iii) connections between the mathematics practiced by cultural groups with institutionalised mathematics that are, at the same time, globalized because they relate mathematics to the socio-cultural context.

AB  - The combination of education and robots is becoming an increasingly important issue. Although researchers have conducted some studies on educational robotics in STEM education at the undergraduate level, no research examined the effects of gamified educational robotics on participants' motivation and creativity. Therefore, this study examines the effects of gamified educational robots on participants' learning motivation and creativity in STEM. A quasi-experimental research design was used in this study. A total of 108 students from two classes enrolled in the information technology course were involved as participants. Learning motivation and creativity scales were used to collect data. The participants were introduced to a gamified educational robot as the course objective, learning content, and game mechanism to increase motivation and help students solve problems. In contrast, students in the control group received conventional instruction consisting of group discussions and lectures. Activities in both groups were held for eighteen weeks in three phases. The results showed that gamified educational robots could enhance learning motivation and positively influence learners' creativity. The results also indicate that learning motivation has significant effects on creativity, and students with high motivation perform better in terms of creativity. The results strengthen interdisciplinary STEM teaching and promote students' learning outcomes.

AB  - In this nascent age of massive online education, it is important to recognize that the goals and successes of a liberal arts education have been to provide an intellectual array of ideas that build critical thinking skills and to engage a new generation of students with society's great challenges and vast opportunities. Nowhere are these opportunities richer than in the basic research questions being posed every day at a research university. In this paper, we argue that the goals of a liberal arts education and undergraduate research are remarkably similar and that by incorporating an undergraduate research focus with a liberal arts approach in the classroom, instructors can more effectively achieve the goals of both. We present the example of ORDER (On Recent Discoveries by Emory Researchers), a series of multidisciplinary, team-taught seminar courses for freshmen and seniors. We argue that ORDER's unique structure provides students with effective opportunities to achieve the core goals of a liberal arts education and a research education, namely to enhance the ability to think critically and draw connections, engage in research as a process, pursue authentic investigation of real-world problems, develop interdisciplinary and collaborative skills, and present ideas creatively.

AB  - Learning Management Systems are instructional platforms that offer opportunities to address the development of core competencies across disciplines. The emergence of instructional models which place greater emphasis on core skill development in science education help to build interdisciplinary communities through curricular connectivity and complementary contextual learning applications. Herein we report on an interconnected core concept and skills approach combining the blended structured use of the Learning Management System (LMS) with a core curricular context for biology and chemistry content. This hybrid was applied to the entry chemistry course for science majors. The threefold interconnected biology-chemistry core concept umbrella areas are Chemical Identity/Matter Classification, the Mole Concept, and Energy. A web-facilitated pedagogy was utilized for the complementary entry-level biological science course. The results provide preliminary evidence of the potential of this instructional approach as a means to both build interdisciplinary community in STEM education and innovate instruction for improved learning outcomes.

AB  - The aim of this study is to provide more knowledge on how outdoor time in Norwegian kindergartens is used as a resource for educational activities regarding science education and physical education. Through a questionnaire and a focus group interview, the study investigated early childhood teachers' perceptions of their work with these subjects and included twelve teachers representing nine kindergartens. According to the teachers, they work more often with these subjects by following up spontaneous situations than through planned activities. They emphasize different science themes and movement experiences depending on the environment they are in and highlight nature as an environment with many opportunities for spontaneous activities. A matter of concern is that one-fourth of the teachers reported that they work only occasionally with these subjects. In addition, the teachers seem to regard themselves less knowledgeable and less prepared to work with science education than physical education.

AB  - Scientific modeling and coding are critical skills to be integrated into K-12 instruction. Research has shown that preservice teachers are often ill-prepared for teaching scientific modeling, and lack opportunities to learn coding within teacher education programs. The present study reports the implementation of an instructional module and online system, called Coding in Scientific Modeling Lessons (CS-ModeL), which was designed to scaffold preservice science teachers' learning to code simulations and design scientific modeling lessons that feature simulation coding. In this study, we examined preservice teachers' epistemic discourse during simulation coding, perceptions of coding for future teaching, and coding-enhanced scientific modeling lessons. This was a qualitative single case study that involved six participants enrolled in a science teacher education course. Participants worked in pairs during scientific modeling activities, and each pair was considered an embedded unit within the single case. Data sources included transcripts of screen recordings captured during simulation coding, transcripts of individual semi-structured interviews, and lessons in which participants used simulation coding as part of scientific modeling activities. Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted. Findings revealed that participants' epistemic discourse led to correction of science misconceptions. However, lack of debugging and conflict argumentation skills detracted from their epistemic discourse quality. Participants perceived coding as a beneficial skill for K-12 students though they voiced concerns about teaching with coding unassisted. Participants failed to design truly interdisciplinary and authentic scientific modeling activities including simulation coding. Study limitations and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - There has been a focus on improving teachers' views of nature of science for decades. The method in which researchers improve views of nature of science, however, varies greatly. This study aimed to improve elementary preservice teachers' views of nature of science and nature of science instruction through a course assignment that required the preservice teachers to use speaking, listening, and writing skills through an interview with young children. They were then asked to write an analysis paper explaining their students' views of nature of science and implications for their future practice. After engaging with the interdisciplinary work of a scientist through nature of science modules and the interview during field experiences, the elementary preservice teachers developed more informed views of science and gained an understanding of the importance of nature of science instruction.

AB  - Students engaged in systems engineering education typically lack experience and understanding of the multidisciplinary complexity of systems engineering projects. Consequently, students struggle to understand the value, rationale, and usefulness of established systems engineering methods, often perceiving them as banal or trivial. The paper presents a learning activity based on a three-stage reverse engineering role-play developed to increase students' awareness of the importance of correctly using systems engineering methods. The activity was developed and integrated in the Systems Engineering course given at Blekinge Institute of Technology. Its effectiveness was analyzed through semistructured self-reflection reports along with two editions of the course. The results showed the development of students' understanding of how to use systems engineering methods. In particular, the students realized the need to deliver detailed and easy-to-read models to the decision makers. This result was in line with the achievement of some of the intended learning outcomes of the course.

AB  - This study explores the influence of an afterschool program involving high needs elementary-aged students at community-based sites and elementary preservice teachers (EPSTs) enrolled in a final sequence of methods courses at a local university. Data collection involved surveys, interviews, and reflections with EPSTs and interviews with elementary-aged children. Results indicated a significant positive correlation between EPTSs' science perceptions and science teaching self-efficacy. A series of Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests indicate significant growth from pre to post in participating EPSTs' self-efficacy with the NGSS and the Engineering Standards within the NGSS. Interviews and reflections provided evidence that EPSTs benefited from the program by teaching in an unfamiliar setting that changed their beliefs and helped strengthen their teaching skills. Interview results for elementary-aged children revealed a hands-on, although somewhat limited, perspective of science, technology, and engineering. Perceptions of mathematics were primarily focused on computation.

AB  - This paper focuses on a design based research study about STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) learning by making through collaboration and production. This study examines learning by making by students to explore STEM using a constructionist approach with a particular focus on computer science and engineering. The use of IoT as a technology enhanced learning (TEL) tool created the learning conditions to be studied: (a) collaborative: no one person had the knowledge to complete the project alone, (b) problem-based: no off the shelf solution was used, and (c) multidisciplinary: the learning context pushed the boundaries across the subjects. The study investigated the learning conditions and indicators of collaboration and production taking place when learning about STEM. The results were used to inform the design of effective data analytics and visualization tools for the PELARS project to advance practice-based learning activities in STEM teaching. However, more specifically, the findings provide insight into the knowledge construction process when learning through making in complex environments. These insights illustrate the combined pedagogical value of collaboration and production supporting the multidisciplinary learning opportunities. The importance of community knowledge construction and its relationship to the pedagogical approach is examined. The significance of these findings in the context of IoT TEL tools in education is explored.

AB  - With an increased emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, educators have often adopted engineering projects for integrating interdisciplinary knowledge through engineering design process. However, there is scant research that has empirically documented the relationships among students' understanding of the knowledge and their characteristics on the design product. This study uses structural equation modeling to examine the influence of students' scientific knowledge, design process, and critical thinking on their design product of the engineering project. A theoretical model was constructed to identify the factors that affected the design product. Study data were collected from 613 high school students, aged 16-17 years, regarding their scientific knowledge, design processes, and critical thinking. The results showed that design process played a mediating role in the effects of knowledge and critical thinking on the final design product. Students who could deduce, explain, and evaluate had an increased ability to apply scientific knowledge during the design process. These results indicate that scientific knowledge has an effect on the process and products of engineering projects completed by high school students. This study also suggested that the science and technology education community should consider offering high school students learning opportunities to promote their cognitive skills and facilitate connections between knowledge and practice.

AB  - This book contains the full text of papers and posters presented at the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2022), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (WIARS). Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2022 received 790 submissions, from more than 45 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. The conference accepted for presentation 263 submissions (33% acceptance rate), from which, 233 submissions are published in full text in these volumes. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. This is the Volume 1 of the book Education and New Developments 2022 and it contains the results of the research and developments conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to promote growth in research methods intimately related to teaching, learning and applications in Education nowadays. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, who will extend our view in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues, by sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This first volume focus in the main areas of Teachers and Students and Teaching and Learning. [For Volume 2, see ED622190. This document contains the proceedings of END 2022: International Conference on Education and New Developments (Madeira, Portugal, June 18-20, 2022).]

AB  - Students' critical thinking is often researched using quantitative tests designed to measure critical thinking. In contrast, this study qualitatively analyses group and whole-class dialogues in an interdisciplinary SSI project by focusing on students' critical thinking practices. As such, the study provides an in-depth example of an immersion approach to teaching critical thinking in an SSI classroom. The SSI project, called the Climate project, lasted 18 lessons and involved an 8th-grade mixed-ability class in a suburb on the west coast of Norway. The data consist of field notes, full-class video recordings and audio recordings of student talk in groups. Based on an interactive ethnographic perspective, patterns in the data were identified using open coding informed by conceptualizations of critical thinking followed by identification and holistic analysis of episodes characteristic of the critical thinking practices in the classroom. The study offers insight into the characteristics of young students' critical thinking in dialogic settings. The students' interpretations, analyses, evaluations, and inferences are based on a mix of knowledge and guesswork. The analysis reveals that the two teachers involved challenged students to, for example, interpret and evaluate information, make inferences, and to suggest alternative views. Explicit teaching of critical thinking was limited. The study demonstrates that it is possible, by employing appropriate teaching strategies, to support students across all levels of abilities in actively participating in critical thinking. Additionally, it shows how specific student centered teaching strategies and students' responses to these strategies contribute to a classroom culture permeated with critical thinking practices.

AB  - Teaching robotics courses online is challenging due to the complexity of the interdisciplinary topics involved. One of the most challenging topics is 3D coordinate transformations. Students often struggle to grasp the concept of 3D coordinate transformations and their relevance to real-world robotic applications. This paper applies the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning methodology to address this challenge and shares the self-evaluation assignments given to students to gradually enhance their ability to solve a real-world robotic navigation problem -- a crucial skill required in almost all robotic applications. Each assignment includes an informative description that explains the purpose of the task and its connection to the next assignment. Manageable MATLAB resources are provided in each assignment, allowing students to study fundamental Matlab scripts and use MATLAB Grader for self-evaluation before submission. The instructor provides feedback on incorrect answers through MATLAB Grader. The assignments focus on problem-solving and can be automatically graded, building upon prior work done by the instructor. The paper will also detail strategies for motivating students to engage with these challenging assignments and how the instructor assists distracted students in catching up with any missing assignments.

AB  - A multidisciplinary science experiment was performed in K-12 classrooms focusing on the interconnection between technology with geology and chemistry. The engagement and passion for science of over eight hundred students across twenty-one classrooms, utilizing a combination of hands-on activities using relationships between Earth and space rock studies, followed by a remote access session wherein students remotely employed the use of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to validate their findings was investigated. Participants represent predominantly low-income minority communities, with little exposure to the themes and equipment used, despite being freely available resources. Students indicated greatly increased interest in scientific practices and careers, as well as a better grasp of the content as a result of the lab and remote access coupling format.

AB  - This paper attempts to add to the multifaceted discussion concerning neoliberalism and globalization out of two Cultural Studies of Science Education journal issues along with the recent Journal of Research in Science Teaching devoted to these topics. However, confronting the phenomena of globalization and neoliberalism will demand greater engagement with relevant sociopolitical thought in fields typically outside the purview of science education. Drawing from thinkers Michel Foucault, Jean Baudrillard, Judith Butler, and Louis Althusser this paper attempts to extend some key ideas coming from Ken Tobin, Larry Bencze, and Lyn Carter and advocates science educators taking up notions of ideology, discourse, and subjectivity to engage globalization and neoliberalism. Subjectivity (and its constitution in science education) is considered alongside two relevant textbook examples and also in terms of its importance in formulating political and culturally relevant questions in science education.

AB  - In the research, the purpose was to implement and evaluate an interdisciplinary curriculum that aimed at developing social sciences pre-service teachers' understanding and knowledge about the nature of science. This research was based on case study design. In order to collect the research data, the methods of observation, interview and document analysis were used. For the analysis of the data, the inductive content analysis approach was applied. The results of the analysis demonstrated that the curriculum implemented had positive influence on the pre-service teachers' understanding and knowledge about the nature of science. In this respect, it was found that the curriculum helped develop the participants' lack of skills and knowledge about the subjects related to "nature of scientific models, nature of observations and values guiding scientists in their work and social lives" included in the content of nature of science. In addition, it was revealed that the pre-service teachers' lack of readiness made the implementation process difficult.

AB  - This article explores the recontextualization of science in the Malawi Standard 6 syllabus for science and technology. It illustrates how relations of power and social control are enacted, using Bernstein's concepts of classification and vertical and horizontal discourse. The syllabus incorporates five 'disciplines': science, technology, health, housecraft and marketing. Integration of science and non-science content weakens inter-disciplinary boundaries. Horizontal discourse is more prevalent than vertical discourse, further weakening access to powerful knowledge inherent in science. Horizontal discourse is particularly evident in housecraft, much of which appears more relevant to future employment than to everyday life in Malawi. Indigenous or local knowledge is validated through its inclusion in the syllabus. The syllabus illustrates Bernstein's concerns about the adverse effects of including horizontal discourse into vertical discourse, thereby limiting opportunities for social mobility. The article ends by questioning the relevance of Bernstein's theory of the pedagogic device for developing countries.

AB  - Interprofessional anatomy dissection (IAD) courses increase students' readiness for interprofessional education (IPE) both in-person and online. During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual environments for anatomy learning were perceived as less effective. Hybrid instruction approaches emerged but have been scarcely evaluated. This study assessed students' experiences with a hybrid IAD course's virtual and in-person components. A hybrid IAD course consisting of virtual and in-person anatomy laboratory-based instruction was offered to 32 students from different health sciences programs. Before and after the full course, students completed the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) and the Interdisciplinary Education Perception Scale (IEPS). After the virtual and the in-person course components, students completed a Q-methodology survey to assess their perceptions of the course. Twenty-eight students (20 females; 24.8 ± 6.3 years old) from different programs (4 Physician Assistant; 2 Midwifery; 3 Speech-Language Pathology; 4 Physiotherapy; 3 Occupational therapy; 4 Nursing; 8 Medicine) participated. The total RIPLS score improved after the 8-week course (Median 84 interquartile range [78-87] vs. 87 [8-90]; p = 0.0145). The Q-methodology identified three factors: IPE & Virtual Enthusiasts, Introspective Learners, and IPE & Virtual Skeptics. Factors represented different levels of students' engagement with the IPE and virtual environment. The transition to in-person resulted in all factors praising the experience. Health science students showed improvements in their readiness for IPE after an 8-week hybrid IAD course. The main differences in the evaluations of the virtual and in-person components were related to engagement and the ability to learn anatomy; no differences were noted between settings regarding engagement in IPE.

AB  - This essay introduces and analyzes a one-class role-play simulation during which students engage in stakeholder negotiations on how to respond to a large flow of refugees between two fictional African countries. Participants acquire an in-depth knowledge of arguments regarding granting and restricting refugees' freedom of movement and civil and economic rights. Contributing to the expanding literature on active and interdisciplinary teaching strategies, this content-oriented simulation teaches public policy, as well as humanitarian and development responses in the wake of a large influx of forced migrants in a developing country. The simulation thus addresses questions related to courses on development, conflict and refugee studies, international organizations, human rights, and international relations. Based on six iterations of the simulation, the essay discusses specific design decisions in the preparation, interaction, and debriefing stage and their impact on the simulation, as well as principal learning outcomes. This includes detailed discussions of briefing memos, role sheets, role selection, and key questions during the debriefing session.

AB  - This paper describes a research project into heritage education. Taking an interdisciplinary perspective from within the field of Experimental and Social Science Education, it presents an analysis of teachers' and administrators' conceptions of heritage, its teaching and its dissemination in Spain. A statistical description is provided of the results of a questionnaire. A factor analysis (FA) was applied to explore possible conjectures accounting for the correlations between the variables with respect to both the conceptualisation of heritage and its teaching and dissemination. The results emphasise the relevance of academic background, initial training and professional context with regard to the conceptualisations of heritage held by the different groups.

AB  - How can we engage new engineering and computer science graduate students in meaningful conversations about research and publication ethics without establishing a common understanding of the issues and expectations? Most universities offer extensive responsible conduct of research (RCR) training programs, which are usually a semester-long. Absent a requirement, it is unlikely that engineering and computer graduate students and their advisors would prioritize a lengthy training during the student's first semester. Recognizing this, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas' Howard R. Hughes College of Engineering designed and implemented an introductory research ethics workshop for all graduate students entering engineering and computer science. We engaged an interdisciplinary team of faculty and staff in the workshop's design and implementation, and approached our design within the sensemaking framework for ethical decision-making. Each workshop included lecture content in four priority topic areas identified by the college faculty: research design and data ethics, publication ethics, computer coding ethics, and intellectual property. The workshops also included a face-to-face panel discussion with experts including engineering, computer science, and law professors; librarians; and technical writers. Our assessment showed that after completing the workshop, students demonstrated increased content knowledge, and their self-assessed expertise ratings were better aligned with their content knowledge.

AB  - Promoting health equity necessitates the diversification of healthcare workforces. Disability is one aspect of diversity that is increasing in healthcare. While the number of Disabled students in health professions increases, barriers in their work integrated learning (WIL), such as placements in hospitals or clinics, persist. While literature has addressed some of these barriers, there is less known about the social processes that enable access in work integrated learning when it does occur. Therefore, an interdisciplinary team from design, geography, occupational science, nursing, occupational therapy, critical disability studies, and knowledge mobilization explored questions regarding social processes involved in WIL accessibility in clinical settings. The team conducted twenty-five in-depth interviews with 4 placement coordinators, 8 placement supervisors, 6 access professionals, 4 education leaders (e.g. Deans) and 3 healthcare leaders (e.g. site education leaders) from two hospitals and two universities in eastern Canada. The team's collaborative thematic analysis of participant narratives constructed four themes regarding the invisible work clinical and academic educators engage in to create access: putting in extra time, doing emotional labour, engaging in relational work, and navigating complexities. This labour is unrecognized and optional, and therefore its result--access to education--is inequitably distributed. Educators, policy makers, and institutions need to know how access is created in WIL to promote diversity within health professions and systems.

AB  - This paper aims at shedding light on what students can "construct" when they learn science and how this construction process may be supported. Constructivism is a pluralist theory of science education. As a consequence, I support, there are several points of view concerning this construction process. Firstly, I stress that constructivism is rooted in two fields, psychology of cognitive development and epistemology, which leads to two ways of describing the construction process: either as a process of enrichment and/or reorganization of the cognitive structures at the mental level, or as a process of building or development of models or theories at the symbolic level. Secondly, I argue that the usual distinction between "personal constructivism" (PC) and "social constructivism" (SC) originates in a difference of model of reference: the one of PC is Piaget's description of "spontaneous" concepts, assumed to be constructed by students on their own when interacting with their material environment, the one of SC is Vygotsky's description of scientific concepts, assumed to be introduced by the teacher by means of verbal communication. Thirdly, I support the idea that, within SC, there are in fact two trends: one, in line with Piaget's work, demonstrates how cooperation among students affects the development of each individual's cognitive structures; the other, in line with Vygotsky's work, claims that students can understand and master new models only if they are introduced to the scientific culture by their teacher. Fourthly, I draw attention to the process of "problem construction" identified by some French authors. Finally, I advocate for an integrated approach in science education, taking into account all the facets of science learning and teaching mentioned above and emphasizing their differences as well as their interrelations. Some suggestions intended to improve the efficiency of science teaching are made.

AB  - Successful integration of digital technologies in the education of young children still needs to be solved. Despite a growing body of research focusing on learning through digital technologies in childhood, there are areas of knowledge where the impact of digital technologies has yet to be explored. A prominent example is nanoscience and nanotechnology (NST), a new interdisciplinary field that promises to solve long-standing global challenges. Considering that NST concerns elements that cannot be observed with the naked eye, their understanding by young children requires appropriate teaching methods. These distinctive aspects of NST align well with the capabilities of smart mobile devices, the critical feature of which is their ability to display interactive simulations and playful visualizations. This study investigates and compares the effect of using tablets and alternative experiential teaching on developing the ability to understand nanoscale elements. To implement the research, we conducted a week-long intervention, including experimental and control groups. Children in the experimental group participated in a nanoteaching session during the school curriculum, using educational software on tablets. The children in the control group participated in a precisely similar instruction but without using technology. To assess the children's performance, the Nanoscale Elementary Knowledge Comprehension Test (TENANO) created for the needs of this study was used. The sample consisted of 101 s-grade primary school children in Greece. The results showed that teaching with tablets compared to alternative experiential teaching contributed significantly to developing young children's nanoliteracy level. Moreover, gender and non-verbal cognitive ability did not seem to differentiate the development of children's ability to understand nanoscale entities.

AB  - This article is about an intervention introducing prehistoric life in primary education. Its objectives were to foster openness and interest for prehistory and archaeology, as well as content knowledge and conceptual learning with a focus on four main facets: basic knowledge about prehistoric life; conceptual learning/change regarding prehistory; learning about archaeologists and archaeology as a scientific discipline; and learning about interactions of archaeology and other disciplines (interdisciplinarity). Students participated in two workshops about the creation of a prehistoric object, highlighting the close interaction between the natural sciences and humanities within archaeology. The workshop emphasised dialogue between students, teachers and researchers, as well as active participation by the students. The educational effects of the workshops were studied using a pre-post design (N = 439, ages 8-10 years). Results show that the workshops had sizeable positive effects on both affective and cognitive variables. The appreciation of the workshops ranged from ˜ 70 to 90% (of maximum value) for interest, perceived educational value and further aspects. We also found a positive impact of the intervention on cognitive variables, e.g. for several elements of key knowledge about prehistory (such as where prehistoric people lived and with what resources; medium to large effect sizes: d > 0.9 and d = 0.46, respectively). Regarding conceptual learning, we found improved understanding of the link between climate change and long-term changes in wildlife in a given area (medium to large effect sizes, d = 0.5-0.8). A positive impact was also found for the understanding of archaeology encompassing both humanities and the natural sciences (e.g. understanding of climate change as inferred from archaeological knowledge, d = 0.3-0.5). No differences of the various outcomes were found between girls and boys; the workshops appear suitable for both genders. We conclude with a discussion of the interpretation of our findings, of some limitations and possible improvements, and of future perspectives, in particular for further classroom implementation.

AB  - Interprofessional learning improves students' clinical and interprofessional competencies. COVID-19 prevented delivering in-person education and motivated the development of a virtual interprofessional cadaveric dissection (ICD) course. This study reports on the effects of a virtual ICD course compared to a previously delivered in-person course, on students' readiness for, and perceptions about, interprofessional learning. Students attending the ICD course in-person (2019-2020) or virtually (2020-2021) completed the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) and the Interdisciplinary Education Perception Scale (IEPS). Students in the virtual course also provided written feedback. Thirty-two (24 women; Median: 24 [Q1-Q3: 22-25] years) and 23 students (18 women; 22 [21-23] years) attended the in-person and virtual courses, respectively. In the virtual cohort, the RIPLS total score (82 [76-87] vs. 85 [78-90]; p = 0.034) and the roles and responsibilities sub-score (11 [9-12] vs. 12 [11-13]; p = 0.001) improved significantly. In the in-person cohort, the roles and responsibilities sub-score improved significantly (12 [10-14] vs. 13 [11-14]; p = 0.017). No significant differences were observed between cohorts (p < 0.05). Themes identified in the qualitative analysis were advantages and positive experiences, competencies acquired, disadvantages and challenges, and preferences and suggestions. In-person and virtual ICD courses seem to have similar effects on students' interprofessional learning. However, students reported preferring the in-person setting for learning anatomy-dissection skills.

AB  - Contribution: Although engineering hackathon events are common, this is one of the first reports of such an event used for the purpose of teaching engineering students about public health concepts. Results from this study suggest that hackathons are an effective format for teaching topics that are not core to the engineering discipline in a short period of time. Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the essential role that computer scientists and engineers have in controlling disease outbreaks. However, engineering programs generally do not provide training on public health issues. Thus, there is a critical need to develop innovative and engaging ways to educate engineering students about public health without interfering with required discipline-specific content. Intended Outcomes: Hackathons, short-term events, held outside of the classroom, can provide an engaging and effective method for increasing the interest and knowledge of engineering students in disease outbreaks. In this article, the effectiveness of a hack day in increasing the interest and knowledge of engineering students in disease outbreaks is assessed. Application Design: One-hundred-six undergraduate students, 30 of whom were engineering majors, participated in a multidisciplinary disease focused hackathon. Student learning and engagement during the hackathon was assessed for the 30 engineering students that participated through pre- and post-event surveys. Findings: The results indicated that the hackathon increased both content knowledge and engagement of engineering students in public health issues. Additionally, students gained an increased understanding of public health professions and how they can contribute to disease tracking, prevention, and treatment. Therefore, hackathons are an effective and efficient tool for teaching engineering students about topics outside of their discipline.

AB  - This research deals with a possible use of history of mathematics in mathematics education. In particular, history can be a fundamental element for the introduction of the concept of integral through a problem-centred and intuitive approach. Therefore, what follows is dedicated to the teaching of mathematics in the last years of secondary schools, where infinitesimal calculus is addressed. The thesis here proposed is that the resort to Archimedes' use of exhaustion method and to Newton's initial lemmas expounded in his Principia Mathematica are useful means to reach a genetic comprehension of the concept of integral. Hence, two demonstrations by Archimedes and two lemmas by Newton are used to prove such thesis. A further idea here proposed is that history of mathematics can be of help for an interdisciplinary education. [For the full proceedings, see ED620289.]

AB  - This literature review offers compelling evidence for the significant role music and song can play in cultivating student engagement in elementary school science lessons. With students disengaging from science education, there is concern about the lack of necessary scientific literacy skills required in today's world. To explore whether music and song could be used engage students in science we conducted a thorough search of composite education databases for relevant scholarly articles published 1993-2021. Synthesis of the resulting 26 articles revealed four themes: the common goal of engagement, evidence of learning improvement, broad utility of music and songs as pedagogical tools, and limited long-term studies. While acknowledging the limited evidence presented in these articles, we emphasize that incorporating music and song into science lessons not only enriches the educational environment but also contributes to an arts-infused education known to enhance student performance across a wide range of curriculum domains. We recommend further research with a particular focus on investigating the impact of music and song on science engagement and learning over the long-term in elementary school science classrooms.

AB  - Evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-devo) is a vibrant area of contemporary life science that should be (and is) increasingly incorporated into teaching curricula. Although the inclusion of this content is important for biological pedagogy at multiple levels of instruction, there are also philosophical lessons that can be drawn from the scientific practices found in Evo-devo. One feature of particular significance is the interdisciplinary nature of Evo-devo investigations and their resulting explanations. Instead of a single disciplinary approach being the most explanatory or fundamental, different methodologies from biological disciplines must be synthesized to generate empirically adequate explanations. Thus, Evo-devo points toward a non-reductionist epistemology in biology. I review three areas where these synthetic efforts become manifest as a result of Evo-devo's practices (form versus function reasoning styles; problem-structured investigations; idealizations related to studying model organisms), and then sketch some possible applications to teaching biology. These philosophical considerations provide resources for life science educators to address (and challenge) key aspects of the "National Science Education Standards" and "Benchmarks for Scientific Literacy."

AB  - Offering core academic credits (e.g., math, science) for completing agriculture, food, and natural resources (AFNR) coursework at the secondary school level has the potential to increase the strength of the AFNR program as well as student interdisciplinary learning. Informed by the Career and Technical Education Student Typology, we explored the scope of core academic offerings in Michigan AFNR programs, including the frequency of core academic offerings, AFNR course types in which core academics are offered, and types of core academic credit obtained. Findings indicate 95.00% of Michigan teachers responding to the survey offered some form of core academic credit through their AFNR coursework. Additionally, findings suggest science is the most obtained core academic credit and the predominance of core academic credit is being offered in introductory course types within AFNR programs. These findings, among others, were synthesized into three conclusions which focus on the frequency of core academic offerings, strength of science as an integrated discipline, and identified opportunities to expand core academic offerings. The paper concludes with a roadmap for continued efforts to enhance core academic offerings and AFNR programs via a combination of research and practice.

AB  - This article sets out to look critically at the use of systematic reviews in the cross-disciplinary field of early childhood and international development. Systematic reviews--a specialist methodology involving the secondary analysis of existing knowledge on a particular topic--is prevalently used to address complex questions in social and health-related policy and is an established tradition in the life and health sciences. In education and the social sciences, there is burgeoning interest in systematic methodological approaches, although its usage remains comparatively lagging compared to the medical field. Drawing on an interdisciplinary systematic review of empirical research on early childhood development and peacebuilding in the Asia Pacific region, this article reflects on the use of the methodology and its potential to inform new conceptual and methodological developments. The article argues that our knowledge of children and the early years can be significantly advanced by furthering debates on systematic reviews particularly in cross-disciplinary fields and its application, as well as relevance for how evidence is evaluated and applied. This is especially pertinent in a sector driven by increasing calls for more reliable and timely information to influence practice and policy decision-making.

AB  - Empirical social science research increasingly involves working collaboratively with organisations beyond the university. This paper contributes to the growing international literature on doctoral collaboration by exploring how UK doctoral students in the social sciences negotiate organisational collaborations. We draw on narrative interviews and administrative data to create a series of case-study vignettes. We juxtapose these with a theorisation of disciplinary knowledge practices to show how such collaborations are at once demanding and unpredictable, but also generative of new understanding and insights. We suggest that Burawoy's ("American Sociological Review," 70(1), 4-28, 2005) model of the 'antagonistic interdependence' of public, critical, professional and policy sociologies is helpful as a heuristic for conceptualising doctoral student experiences of a range of different (and often contradictory) forms of social scientific knowledge. Our analysis demonstrates that both instrumental and critical forms of social knowledge can emerge from organisational partnerships and placements. We call for further attention to the 'generative paradoxes' (Bartunek and Rynes "Journal of Management," 40(5), 1181-1201, 2014) and 'reflective entanglements' (Jagoda 2016) that result from doctoral collaborations, and for doctoral pedagogies that help students use these experiences to develop criticality and see it as a key skill in social research.

AB  - Long before "fake news" became a catchphrase, misguided beliefs about scientific truths undermined the free exercise of democracy and personal decision-making. Journalistic norms such as providing false balance in the name of "objectivity," deliberate manipulation by vested interests, and the human tendency toward confirmation bias combined to enable the dissemination of damaging misinformation about tobacco, climate change, vaccines, nuclear power, genetically modified foods, and other topics critical to the health and welfare of the modern world. This article examines an innovative new course designed to teach a mixed group of journalism and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) majors to evaluate expertise and bias, examine data and misrepresentation, and develop evidence-based communication on complex scientific topics. The course covered concepts such as fact-checking, validation, fraud, the "backfire effect," confirmation bias, limitations of the scientific method, conspiracy theories, misuse of statistics, and the role of journalists and scientists as truth-tellers in society. Journalism and science students learned to communicate with each other and with their respective audiences. A series of critical thinking assignments culminated in a final project where students, working in mixed teams, developed an interactive multimedia project communicating a controversial science topic to the public. This interdisciplinary course is offered as one model for teaching science literacy and information literacy to journalism and STEM students.

AB  - Augmented Reality (AR) technology and games can enhance motivation for learning. When combined with mobile devices, AR technology can promote authentic learning in outdoor environments, such as urban parks. These spaces can be used for Science Education, particularly, for environmental education and nature conservation. The EduPARK project combines these elements and follows a design-based research approach to develop an interactive mobile AR game to be explored by students, teachers and the general public, as visitors, in a specific urban park, integrating four interdisciplinary educational guides. The app development involved four cycles of user testing and evaluation for progressive refinement, according to the users' feedback in each cycle. The focus of this paper is to analyze the users' perceptions in the two last cycles of the app refinement, regarding its learning value and usability. The users were students of different school levels (24 of Basic Education; and 46 of Higher Education). Data collection involved a focus group interview, a questionnaire and the app's usage data. Content analysis, descriptive statistics, and System Usability Scale (SUS) computing were conducted. Results revealed that the EduPARK app promotes learning, enjoyment and is easy to use. It achieved an excellent usability, according to younger students (85.8 of average SUS) and a good usability according to older students (70.9). From the last refinement cycle, the app's final version has emerged, which is freely available to the public in the Google Store. In the future, more evaluation experiences are needed to better understand the benefits of this mobile AR game for learning in urban parks. [For the complete proceedings, see ED590271.]

AB  - The focus of this research was to test the impact of an authentic science experience on preservice teachers' self-efficacy and their beliefs about their perceived outcomes with middle level students. Data show that there was a statistically significant decrease in the levels of self-efficacy towards teaching science and no significant change in their beliefs about having positive outcomes. Three institutions (a university, a local park district and a school district) formed a partnership with the mission of enhancing science learning for middle school students. The pre-service teachers examined artifacts discovered during an archeological dig of a chair factory and created inter-disciplinary units based on the artifacts during science methods courses. Pre-service teachers then taught these units to 4th graders, when they visited the park.

AB  - Growing research evidence indicates student learning gains from guided representation construction/invention in school science and mathematics. In this inquiry approach, students address challenges around what features of a phenomenon/problem to attend to, what data to collect, how and why, and make collective judgments about multimodal accounts of phenomena. However, researchers to date have tended to focus on student learning rather than on the teacher's role in guiding various phases of inquiry. In this paper we report on (a) analysis of Grade 1 students' engagement in interdisciplinary mathematics and science inquiry practices in a classroom sequence in ecology; (b) the teacher's role in guiding such inquiry; and (c) interpretation of these practices in terms of support of student transduction (connecting and remaking meanings across representations in different modes). Data from our study included video capture of two case study teachers' guidance of tasks and classroom discussion and student artefacts. We examine the classroom processes through which the teachers used students' invention and revision of data displays to teach the concepts of living things, diversity, distribution and adaptive features related to habitat in science. Mathematical processes included constructing and interpreting mapping, measurement and data modelling, sampling and using a scale. The analysis offers fresh insights into how teachers support student learning in these two subjects, through discrete stages of orienting, representation challenge, building consensus and applying and extending representational systems.

AB  - This case study presents the results of an interdisciplinary Virtual Exchange (VE) that was arranged between Finnish and Polish students in 2019. During their six-week collaboration, the students of language studies at the University of Jyväskylä, Finland, worked in teams together with their Polish peers specialising in information and communications technology and management in tourism at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, Poland. The international teams combined their linguistic and tourism-promotion expertise, and, using collaborative digital tools, grappled with the tasks of analysing the official municipal city websites and promoting the lesser-known aspects of their sister cities (Jyväskylä and Poznan) in jointly created videos.

AB  - Despite the number of university students who take courses in multiple science disciplines, little is known about how they connect concepts between disciplines. Energy is a concept that underlies all scientific phenomena and, as such, provides an appropriate context in which to investigate student connections and misconnections across disciplines. In this study, university students concurrently enrolled in introductory chemistry and biology were interviewed to explore their perceptions of the integration of energy both within and across the disciplines, and how they attempted to accommodate and reconcile different disciplinary approaches to energy, to inform future, interdisciplinary course reform. Findings suggest that, while students believed energy to be important to the scientific world and to the disciplines of biology and chemistry, the extent to which it was seen as central to success in their courses varied. Differences were also apparent in students' descriptions of the molecular-level mechanisms by which energy transfer occurs. These findings reveal a disconnect between how energy is understood and used in introductory science course work and uncovers opportunities to make stronger connections across the disciplines. We recommend that instructors engage in interdisciplinary conversations and consider the perspectives and goals of other disciplines when teaching introductory science courses.

AB  - Context: Qualitative methodologies are relatively new in health sciences education research, especially in the area of problem-based learning (PBL). A key advantage of qualitative approaches is the ability to gain in-depth, textured insights into educational phenomena. Key methodological issues arise, however, in terms of the strategies of inquiry, data collection methods, and analytical approaches. This review aims to identify and appraise the current applications of qualitative studies in PBL and indicate possible new methodological directions. Methods: Two computerized databases, Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) and PubMed, were screened for solely qualitative studies of PBL in health sciences education between 2000 and 2015. Selected articles were grouped for systematic description, critical analysis, and evaluation, with a key focus on identifying methodological trends. Results: The number of recent qualitative research studies of PBL in health sciences education is small but growing, with 61 solely qualitative articles identified in the review period. Four main research issues in PBL were identified for qualitative investigation: (1) participants' experiences or perceptions; (2) facilitation; (3) assessment; and (4) educational technologies. Participants' experiences or perceptions of PBL have drawn the most research attention to date. Methodological approaches included: self-reported studies using interview data (n = 29); studies analyzing video recordings of PBL tutorials (n = 9); introspective studies analyzing written reflections (n = 6); and studies using multiple qualitative methods (n = 17). Of the 61 identified studies, the majority are perception studies, with only a limited number focused on PBL processes or interactional analyses. Conclusions: This review presented and analyzed current practices in qualitative studies of PBL in health sciences education and indicated new directions. Research designs are expanding beyond an initial focus on post-hoc perception studies to explore innovative, in situ qualitative inquiries and methodologies.

AB  - Science education scholars emphasize the significance of an integrative, interdisciplinary STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education that encourages students to learn about the natural world through exploration, inquiry, and problem-solving experiences. This article reports on a professional development program aimed at improving a group of secondary science and mathematics teachers' competence in using a problem-based approach in the teaching of STEM. Through surveys, qualitative interviews and focus groups, the study investigated the teachers' understanding and perceptions of problem-based learning (PBL) as an approach to interdisciplinary STEM education as well as their perceptions of the personal and systemic challenges in implementing such an approach in their professional practice. This investigation offers insight into how university-based professional development programs can support secondary educators' understanding of, and ability to use an interdisciplinary problem-based STEM approach in their schools and classrooms. The study concludes with implications for practice and a discussion of how future interdisciplinary professional development can be conceptualized.

AB  - Recent education policy designed to promote arts education tends to focus on how such curriculum supports "skills for innovation" required for success in the global economy. Emphasis on the transfer of arts-based learning to professional innovation and achievement, a dynamic that is difficult to determine, can undermine the value of teaching the arts for their own sake. Three professors at the State University of New York at New Paltz discuss curriculum they developed to take advantage of museum learning opportunities that promote critical thinking, foster innovation, support course content, and increase students' sense of citizenship and belonging. Jennifer Waldo, a professor of Biology, Dennis Doherty, a professor of English and Creative Writing, and Sarah Wyman, a professor of 20th century Comparative Literature, use their campus museum as an applied learning environment where they facilitate interdisciplinary, experiential educational activities that develop student agency and encourage imaginative inquiry. The professors comment on their curriculum, their cross-disciplinary conversations, student reactions, and indicators of transfer. In addition, they present a strategy for assessing student-learning outcomes within a context that values the visual arts as fundamental to liberal arts and sciences education.

AB  - The technical barriers to video production are decreasing and the popularity of video as an instructional medium in science is increasing. Although a large body of education research is available to inform the selection and design of instructional videos, this research is dispersed across journals, disciplinary traditions, and STEM fields, and the practical lessons are not readily accessible to readers. To guide the development and critique of science and mathematics instructional videos, our interdisciplinary team, with members from mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, has developed an instrument by synthesizing the relevant education literature and translating it into recommendations for practice. The user-friendly instrument is a 12-item checklist grouped into the categories of content and sequencing (concepts, logic, story, and language), cognitive supports (visualizations, signals, synchronization, segmentation, and streamlining) and affective considerations (relevance, rapport, and accessibility). The instrument provides a conceptual foundation and evaluation framework for designers of educational videos.

AB  - Looking at the current discourse on how to teach disaster, one apparent gap is that the scientific aspect of disaster is discussed and taught mostly in isolation from its human aspect. Disaster educators seem to be primarily interested in addressing issues such as social vulnerability, community resilience, personal action-related knowledge and emotion rather than the scientific basis of disasters, whereas science educators often fail to make connections between the scientific accounts of disasters and the social and political contexts that surround them. In this theoretical paper, I claim that this disconnect is problematic and that overcoming it is a key to understanding and teaching disaster in a more nuanced and comprehensive manner. Drawing primarily on science and technology studies (STS) on disaster, I explore the potential of interpreting disasters as failures of socio-technical systems, which helps us unearth the inner workings of the complex network of science, technology and society in the wake of calamities. STS challenges the dichotomous understanding of the material and social worlds and takes a view that they shape each other to constitute socio-technical systems. Taking such an approach to disaster allows a synthetic understanding of the natural, technological and human-made disasters that we are faced with in the age of uncertainty and complexity. Based on the ideas of STS and examples of recent disasters in East Asian countries, I argue that disaster education and science education can cross-pollinate in tackling the post-disaster hardship and cultivating responsible citizens.

AB  - Background: How do we account for the persistent difficulty the U.S. community of science has in educating larger numbers of talented and diverse undergraduates? We posit that the problem lies in the community's unremitting focus on scientific subject matter knowledge and students' ability to learn, to the neglect of interpersonal social relations--particularly trust. Our study focuses on trust in academic mentoring. This topic is particularly relevant in studies of the undergraduate segment of the pipeline into science that typically occurs in large, impersonal settings that often generate student alienation. Our study hypothesizes that trustworthy relations may be both a significant condition for academic mentoring as well as an important outcome. Purpose: The study we report explores the promise of a new research direction in undergraduate science education, one focused on trust in academic mentoring. A focus on interpersonal trust is unusual, if not entirely overlooked, in most studies of undergraduate science education, and stands in sharp contrast to the situation in K-12 education where an emergent body of survey and field research measures trust and documents its educational importance. Our framework derives from social capital theory and cautions that a science curriculum that informs and motivates entails attention not only to cognition, as indicated by subject matter knowledge, but also to the educational significance of other complex forms of cognition that undergird social skill, relational awareness, and the development and maintenance of trust. Research Design: Because the MARC-U*STAR training program funded by the National Institutes of Health sponsors only a select number of talented upper division science major students on each host campus, our correlational analyses were based on a unique and relatively small sample of data collected from undergraduate science major students (N = 161) in 16 colleges and universities in the Pacific Southwest. We analyzed the data in two linked parts: (a) an analysis of the association between trust and motivation; and (b) an evaluation of whether the Program affects trust. We link the two parts by using the same longitudinal dataset in each and, further, by building the evaluation on the findings from models that compare trust and motivation among upper division science major students enrolled in the Program (n = 49) with trust and motivation among upper division science major students not in the Program (n = 112). Given the study's exploratory purpose and design limits, we situate the results near the front end of the continuum from preliminary studies designed to suggest further research directions to the kinds of precise predictions we can expect from truly randomized controlled experiments. Findings: Despite its necessarily preliminary findings regarding trust, this study contributes to the literature on academic mentoring in undergraduate science education in several ways. First, our study develops a novel conceptual perspective on the measure and utility of trust as a crucial form of social capital. Second, we used this perspective to develop a set of structural models that suggest interpersonal trust is producible in undergraduate science education; is pedagogically powerful, not a mere nicety; and is particularly important for students who are members of groups historically underrepresented in the sciences. Third, and surprising because the literature on trust does not prepare for them, are results suggesting that trust may work differently for different groups of students in different contexts. Conclusions/Recommendations: Our findings are unusual and encouraging, and they bring several issues to light regarding (a) the utility of theory in research and practice in undergraduate science education, (b) inequitable representation in the sciences, and (c) contextual complexities that condition the development and maintenance of trust within institutional settings. First, our framework on trust derives from social capital theory and cautions that a science curriculum that informs and motivates entails attention not only to cognition but also to the educational significance of other complex forms of cognition that undergird social skill, relational awareness, and the development and maintenance of trust. In cognitively and socially consequential exchanges in undergraduate science education, trust and mistrust are important. Next, our most unusual finding--that trust in a mentor seems to matter more for the motivation and career expectations of the MARC-U*STAR Program students than for non-Program students--raises the question: How does trust in a university mentor matter for equitable undergraduate education in science? With our data, we cannot fully account for this unexpected finding. Drawing from studies that disentangle the concept of interpersonal trust from more generalized notions of trust in the social environment, we have worked at a tentative interpretation: Perhaps interpersonal trust is especially impactful in situations where the more general social environment poses perceptible threats. Last, when the literature on trust is examined concurrently with our findings, trust emerges not as an invariant entity, but as supremely contextualized. We conclude by calling for a more expansive, multidisciplinary, and multimethod research agenda focused on trust, which may contribute to a reorientation of undergraduate science education.

AB  - Radiation oncologists require an in-depth understanding of anatomical relationships for modern clinical practice, although most do not receive formal anatomy training during residency. To fulfill the need for instruction in relevant anatomy, a series of four multidisciplinary, interactive learning modules were developed for a cohort of radiation oncology and medical physics residents. Instructional design was based on established learning theories, with the intent of integrating knowledge of specific anatomical regions with radiology and radiation oncology practice. Each session included presentations by a radiologist and a radiation oncologist, as well as hands-on exploration of anatomical specimens with guidance from anatomists. Pre- and post-tests distributed during each session showed significant short-term knowledge retention. According to qualitative surveys and exit interviews, participants felt more comfort with delineating structures, gross anatomy, and radiograph interpretation at the end of each session. Overall participant experience was positive, and the modules were considered effective for learning radiologic anatomy. Suggestions for future interventions include more time, increased clinical application, additional contouring practice and feedback, and improved coordination between each of the three disciplines. Results and conclusions from this study will be used to inform the design of a future multi-day national workshop for Canadian radiation oncology residents.

AB  - We describe the Science Semester, a semester-long course block that integrates three science courses and a science education methods course for elementary teacher education majors, and examine prospective elementary teachers' developing conceptions about inquiry, science teaching efficacy, and reflections on learning through inquiry. The Science Semester was designed to provide inquiry-oriented and problem-based learning experiences, opportunities to examine socially relevant issues through cross-disciplinary perspectives, and align with content found in elementary curricula and standards. By the end of the semester, prospective elementary teachers moved from naïve to intermediate understandings of inquiry and significantly increased self-efficacy for science teaching as measured on one subscore of the STEBI-B. Reflecting on the semester, prospective teachers understood and appreciated the goals of the course and the PBL format, but struggled with the open-ended and student-directed elements of the course.

AB  - This study explores the views of Indonesian junior high school pre-service science teachers (PSTs) towards teaching based on socio-scientific issues (SSIs). Questionnaires were analyzed qualitatively and descriptively. The PSTs (N=62) acknowledged that student competencies ranging from personal to socially relevant skills as well as character formation can potentially be developed through SSI-based instruction. The PSTs mentioned several challenges which may hinder implementation of SSI-based instruction. These include the interdisciplinary and controversial nature of SSIs, a lack of familiarity regarding SSIs, the lack of necessary student skills, insufficient teacher expertise, and curriculum constraints. The PSTs viewed SSIs as able to potentially enhance their personal competencies through SSI-based instruction, mostly with regard to pedagogical skills. The relevance of SSI-based instruction was, however, not seen in as positive a light as the participants' views on the need of character building. The PSTs' intentions to later implementing SSI-based instruction ranged from medium to high.

AB  - A new, interdisciplinary, team-taught course has been designed to educate students in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) so that they can respond to global and urgent issues concerning computer control systems in nuclear power plants. This paper discusses our experience and assessment of the interdisciplinary computer and nuclear energy course, which was developed and offered primarily to ECE students at Howard University. A unique team-teaching model utilized with ECE professors and nuclear field experts was applied to teach the two diverse subjects: computer safety and nuclear energy. The survey result from the first offering of the course showed a very positive response from the majority of the students about the team-teaching method and the knowledge acquired on the two subjects.

AB  - This book contains the full text of papers and posters presented at the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2022), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (WIARS). Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2022 received 790 submissions, from more than 45 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process.

AB  - Ensuring that learning is participatory and even further democratized seems particularly important at a time when people are kept apart because of a COVID-19 pandemic that thrives on proximity. Whilst learning is based on exchanges, it also benefits from the existence of a learning community, the access to which needs to be equal and taking account of learners' diversity. How is Higher Education equipping itself to adapt to new learning conditions? How can it ensure that it can meet new types of needs? To address these questions, a workshop was organized at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Research on Education and Development (CeiED), Lisbon, on an emerging area of research called 'Citizen Science'. Citizen Science has been gaining popularity in many disciplines. Here, we are interested in how it could help to improve education and learning, as well as how current research in education might also help approaches in Citizen Science to move forward. Reflections on theory were carried out in parallel with a one-day practical online workshop on 'operationalizing Citizen Science', involving researchers in the center's three areas -- education, museology, and urbanism. This article explains the outcomes of this event.

AB  - Educational approaches that enable students to actively and directly participate in "real-world" projects are increasingly recognized as valuable pedagogical tools and, as such, being incorporated into university curriculums worldwide. Though not traditionally associated with political science courses, project-based international service learning presents a tremendous opportunity to bring classroom concepts and theories to life, provide an active approach to addressing international challenges, and assist students in the development of the hands-on, problem-solving, team-based, critical-thinking skills that are increasingly important to employers across all sectors. This article seeks to encourage political science faculty to incorporate international service learning--and/or project-based approaches--into their educational offerings. Through examination of the course "Global Synthesis in Liberal Arts and Engineering Studies" at California Polytechnic State University, we have identified multiple factors that can help promote successful execution of project-based international service learning as a pedagogical tool, and provide additional suggestions for faculty interested in adopting specific aspects of these educational approaches, and/or in doing so closer to home.

AB  - In light of the challenges facing science educators and special education teachers in Singapore, this study entails design-based research to develop participatory learning environments. Drawing upon Vygotskian perspectives, this case study was situated in an informal workshop around the theme of "day and night" working for Special Needs Students in Singapore. Moving away from traditional astronomy teaching, we aim to explore interdisciplinary multimodal modeling activities towards developing a participatory learning environment. As the main finings of this case study, the central benefits of interdisciplinary multimodal modeling activities are twofold: (1) promoting multiliteracies development using digital and multimodal resources for supporting the emotional and social experiences in developing learners' astronomical understanding; and (2) integrating learners' everyday experiences with scientific astronomical understanding for the development of higher cognitive functions. These findings emphasize the need for the cultural development of Special Needs Students.

AB  - In the current research study the use of Wikis as an online didactic tool to apply project-based learning in higher education was reported. The study was conducted in university teacher education programmes. During the online activities, participants developed interdisciplinary projects for the primary school working collaboratively in small groups in a Wiki virtual environment within the Moodle platform. Science was at the core of the projects and acted as an organising hub to finding links with other disciplines. A mixed-methods approach involving the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data was adopted in the current research study. The authors developed the following three instruments in order to measure both processes and outcomes of the online activities: the interdisciplinary project-based learning questionnaire, the reflection questionnaire and a rubric for assessing interdisciplinary projects. The current paper focuses only on the qualitative data, which were subjected to an inductive content analysis. Results provided evidence of the processes involved during the collaborative activities and that online activities can develop teachers' abilities to design projects in interdisciplinary contexts. The discussion highlights the aspects of the online environment that made the collaborative work effective in learning. Future implications and suggestions for teacher education programmes are discussed.

AB  - Creative thinking and scientific knowledge are essential components of twenty-first-century learning. The aim is to assess the effectiveness of an inquiry-based interdisciplinary course of study, complemented by training that stimulates the development of creative and research skills. The main sample, which provided the most complete data set, consisted of 175 students. Participants filled out a questionnaire created by the authors and presented in Appendix A to get the participants' assessment of the characteristics of the training course. The analysis was carried out using the Atlas.ti software. The study of Pearson's correlation between the variables of the questionnaire, as well as the variables of the questionnaire and the estimates of the 'creative and search process' according to the results of the described analysis was carried out. A significant correlation was revealed between such factors as 'satisfaction with the training course' and 'usefulness of the training course' (r = 0.85), 'usefulness of the training course' and 'research process' (r = 0.72), 'satisfaction with the training course' and 'creative process' (r = 0.62). The research results can be implemented in colleges and universities to create specialised training courses or training elements in order to increase creativity and improve the scientific thinking of students with usage of electronic educational environment.

AB  - Background and purpose: The purpose of this study was to record and measure the level of involvement and appreciation that prospective teachers in art and science education programmes demonstrated during a four-session integrated activity. Art and science education prospective teachers from a Rocky Mountain region university in the US worked in partnership to produce a science-related art piece using a silk batik painting technique. This project incorporated the use of two hands-on activities (a sampler and a final piece). In addition, pre- and post-activity surveys helped researchers investigate whether an integrated activity led to changes in attitudes towards collaborative instruction among students from art and science education. A practical implication of these results could guide students' teaching assignments and professional careers. Sample: This project involved the participation of 34 prospective teachers enrolled in secondary art and science education pedagogical content courses at a public university in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. Design and method: Prospective teachers in art and science education programmes worked together in a four-session integrated activity for three consecutive years. Participants were tasked with the design of art pieces addressing a core concept from the secondary school science curriculum using the batik painting technique. This project included two hands-on activities (a sampler and a final piece). In addition, they responded to pre- and post-activity surveys. Results: Overall, the data show significant variation at pre- and post-survey, indicating that students had more knowledge after the study than before regarding the integration of art and science in the secondary school curriculum. The mean of interdisciplinary teaching ratings increased on all four target survey items according to the 10-point rating scale. Based on the results, the integrated art and science instructional approach significantly influenced prospective teachers' attitudes about collaborative practices. Conclusion: In general, students' responses on survey items addressing content skills and previous experience of art or geological/biological images in the classroom were affected by their major area. Our experience suggests that an integrated learning experience is an effective way to improve prospective teachers' self-ratings of knowledge and ability to develop and engage students from secondary school classrooms with interdisciplinary connections.

AB  - Elementary teachers are tasked with the challenge of implementing Next Generation Science Standards-aligned projects that integrate science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science (STEM + CS) in a variety of classroom contexts. This study investigates how teachers verbally support students in two classrooms, one general education class and one inclusive class with a larger proportion of students with individualized educational plans, to engage in a Next Generation Science Standards-aligned, STEM + CS unit. Teachers' verbal support for students to understand how (pragmatic) and when and why (epistemic) to use practices was examined during whole-class discussions for a 4-week unit in science, engineering, and computer science-focused lessons. Bi-weekly teacher surveys and weekly teacher interviews provided insight into the teachers' perceptions of students and project activities in each class section. Teachers reported instructional decisions to modify their enactment of the interdisciplinary curricular materials for the Inclusive Class and discussed their rationales for these modifications. Results suggest that instructional decisions that teachers made in how to verbally support students may depend upon their own knowledge of the different disciplines being integrated, their prior beliefs of students in different classroom contexts, and their in-the-moment perceptions of student needs. These factors may have led to different learning experiences for the students in each class section. Findings underscore the need for more research to better understand what kinds of support students and teachers need to be able to integrate engineering, science, and computer science content and practices within their elementary classrooms and provide equitable learning opportunities for all students.

AB  - Recently, there has been a substantial amount of research on smart classrooms, encompassing a number of areas, including Information and Communication Technology, Machine Learning, Sensor Networks, Cloud Computing, and Hardware. Smart classroom research has been quickly implemented to enhance education systems, resulting in higher engagement and empowerment of students, educators, and administrators. Despite decades of using emerging technology to improve teaching practices, critics often point out that methods miss adequate theoretical and technical foundations. As a result, there have been a number of conflicting reviews on different perspectives of smart classrooms. For a realistic smart classroom approach, a piecemeal implementation is insufficient. This survey contributes to the current literature by presenting a comprehensive analysis of various disciplines using a standard terminology and taxonomy. This multi-field study reveals new research possibilities and problems that must be tackled in order to integrate interdisciplinary works in a synergic manner. Our analysis shows that smart classroom is a rapidly developing research area that complements a number of emerging technologies. Moreover, this paper also describes the co-occurrence network of technological keywords using VOSviewer for an in-depth analysis.

AB  - Participatory evaluation tools have been shown to be effective for program development in various settings, including in higher education. Taking student perspectives into consideration is key for graduate program development, particularly in interdisciplinary programs. The current study utilizes Group Level Assessment (GLA), a participatory program evaluation tool, to evaluate the Biomedical Informatics (BMI) PhD Program at the University of Cincinnati (UC) and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). The study was conducted two years after the program was established, an appropriate timing to gauge the opinions of current doctoral students as the program grows and develops. The findings show the strengths and identify areas of improvement of the doctoral program, providing an evidence base for administrators and faculty to work collaboratively with students to capitalize on assets and address potential issues.

AB  - Citizen science, research in which members of the public actively contribute scientific data, has recently evolved as a means to support scientific inquiry in the classroom, particularly in fields related to ecology and environmental science. Our research focuses on a collaborative project with teacher candidates, a science education professor, and a social studies education professor at a Canadian university. Teacher candidates were engaged in the classroom and beyond as they explored topics related to civics education and evidence-based decision making. Our findings demonstrate the potential effectiveness of a citizen science lens for science, social studies, and generalist teachers.

AB  - Professional development becomes relevant and effective when teachers are actively involved, collaborate, and when it is linked to teachers' daily school practice (Hunzicker in "Prof Dev Educ" 37:177-179, 2011). Preparation of teachers for a curriculum implementation such as the new subject Nature, Life, and Technology can be done by a professional development programme where teachers are actively involved (Visser et al. 2010). This study evaluates the designed and implemented professional development programme with respect to its effectiveness in terms of degree of teacher learning and development. Effects are evaluated for five learning areas: Instructional strategies, differences in students' prior knowledge, adjustments to the module, assessment methods and instruments, and field trips and guest lectures. Eleven teachers from four different schools participated in two professional development programmes, six teachers in the first professional development programme and five teachers in the programme for the subsequent module. Questionnaires and interviews were used to assess the effects in the different learning areas. The findings show that the professional development programme is a useful venture for teachers' professional growth in different learning areas.

AB  - Recently, there has been increasing criticism concerning academic computer science education. This paper presents a new approach based on the principles of constructivist learning design as well as the ideas of knowledge transfer in communities of practice. The course "High-tech Entrepreneurship and New Media" was introduced as an interdisciplinary project management lab in which students collaborate in groups to develop software solutions for authentic problems. Main goals were the tighter integration of university and local start-up companies, an intense knowledge transfer on software engineering methods, as well as the implementation of constructivist learning principles in academic teaching. This paper presents the background and structure of the course as well as the results of a formative evaluation. While being successful in introducing a course based on digital-media assisted, constructivist learning arrangements, establishing lasting communities of practice between university and industry is still an open issue. After discussing several reasons, the paper concludes with a list of general recommendations on how to improve the approach and its implementation. (Contains 1 note and 5 tables.)

AB  - Professional knowledge is highlighted as an important prerequisite of both medical doctors and teachers. Based on recent conceptions of professional knowledge in these fields, knowledge can be differentiated within several aspects. However, these knowledge aspects are currently conceptualized differently across different domains and projects. Thus, this paper describes recent frameworks for professional knowledge in medical and educational sciences, which are then integrated into an interdisciplinary two-dimensional model of professional knowledge that can help to align terminology in both domains and compare research results. The models' two dimensions differentiate between cognitive types of knowledge and content-related knowledge facets and introduces a terminology for all emerging knowledge aspects. The models' applicability for medical and educational sciences is demonstrated in the context of diagnosis by describing prototypical diagnostic settings for medical doctors as well as for teachers, which illustrate how the framework can be applied and operationalized in these areas. Subsequently, the role of the different knowledge aspects for acting and the possibility of transfer between different content areas are discussed. In conclusion, a possible extension of the model along a "third dimension" that focuses on the effects of growing expertise on professional knowledge over time is proposed and issues for further research are outlined.

AB  - Acquisition of conceptual knowledge is a central aim in science education. In this study we monitored an interdisciplinary hypermedia assisted learning unit on hibernation and thermodynamics based on cooperative learning. We used concept mapping for the assessment, applying a pre-test/post-test design. In our study, 106 9th graders cooperated by working in pairs (n = 53) for six lessons. As an interdisciplinary learning activity in such complex knowledge domains has to combine many different aspects, we focused on long-term knowledge. Learners working cooperatively in dyads constructed computer-supported concept maps which were analysed by specific software. The data analysis encompassed structural aspects of the knowledge corresponding to a target reference map. After the learning unit, the results showed the acquisition of higher-order domain-specific knowledge structures which indicates successful interdisciplinary learning through the hypermedia learning environment. The benefit of using a computer-assisted concept mapping assessment for research in science education, and in science classrooms is considered.

AB  - The article presents our Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) activities in the project-based Science education of third graders (8--9-year-old pupils) in the Slovak Republic. Individual tasks of project assignment titled "Temperature Measurement" were conceived for "guided inquiry". We also supported the IBL of pupils by interactive education strategy--Integrated e-Learning (INTe-L). The strategy was built on the role of interactive simulations and experimenting at the knowledge acquisition. The following INTe-L components were used: (a) on-site and remote experiments, (b) interactive simulations and (c) electronic study materials. The research was based the hypothesis that the project-based teaching of the topic "Temperature Measurement" using the IBL activities is significantly more efficient than traditional (instructivist) way of teaching. To verify the hypothesis, we carried out a pedagogical experiment on a sample of 60 respondents. The third graders were divided into two parallel groups: an experimental group (EG, 30 pupils) and control group (CG, 30 pupils). To get a relevant feedback, pre-test and post-test were developed and applied. The results attained in the EG were statistically processed, evaluated, and subsequently compared with those in the CG. The analysis of the results attained by the EG showed that their knowledge acquisition has been increased by 24% compared to CG. We have created a methodology for making simple scientific project assignments with the implementation of all components of the new integrated e-learning education strategy (real and real remote experiment, e-simulation, e-learning material). On a specific example of the topic "Temperature Measurement" in primary education, we have presented the possibility of using a "guided inquiry" in the implementation of individual experimental tasks. We have introduced a form of teamwork that allows to harmonize the teaching requirements with individual learning approach and helps to prepare pupils for planned work and independent knowledge acquisition and problem solving. The study has shown that complex IBL activities can be successfully applied at primary school 3rd grade level already. Our form of education with the wider use of modern information and communication technologies (ICT) was attractive for the learners and helped them to develop interdisciplinary relationships. The integrated e-learning has helped third grades to develop a deeper conceptual understanding of temperature and allowed them to prepare presentations to demonstrate their conceptual knowledge. The approach allowed pupils to gain key competencies in Science (discussion and presentation of results). It has also increased the pupils' interest in Science in general and helped them to understand links between different subjects.

AB  - In the particular case of Spain, student and teacher difficulties associated with the mathematical discipline have been evidenced in PISA and TEDS-M reports. As we consider that the teachers' difficulties are connected to the students' performance, we propose a multi-disciplinary approach to deliver specific didactic/mathematical knowledge to the trainee teachers. Such additional instruction shall be meaningfully connected to the real needs of the schools, so a service-learning approach is proposed here. In the present manuscript, the trainee teachers have co-designed educational escape rooms (in coordination with local schools) with the aim of mobilizing curricular knowledge. The goal of the educational escape rooms is to foster the mathematic-related competencies by establishing meaningful connections to other curricular disciplines (music-related knowledge, in the case of this study). This paper reports on the particular experience developed with a group of students (trainee teachers) while designing their educational escape rooms, focusing on the particular case of a specific student to evidence the formative potential of the procedure. The didactic suitability of the proposed escape room has been analyzed and professional development has also been discussed, showing the mobilization of relevant professional skills and fostering the related music and mathematical didactic competencies by shifting the teaching perspective from an algorithmic point of view to a more "reasoning and designing" strategy. This constitutes an evidence of the formative potential on the co-design of educational escape rooms, when designed in the frame of a service learning approach.

AB  - Current reform efforts in science education around the world call on teachers to use integrated approaches to teach science. As a part of such reform efforts in the United States, engineering practices and engineering design have been identified in K-12 science education standards. However, there is relatively little is known about effective ways of teaching science through engineering design. The study explores the approaches or strategies used by a sixth grade science teacher to teach science and engineering in an integrative manner. Classroom observations, teacher interview, and student surveys were used to study the features of engineering integration implemented by the teacher and the changes in student interest in science and engineering by participating in an engineering design-based science unit. Findings suggest that the teacher explicitly included practices and core ideas from engineering and science; used an engaging, motivating engineering challenge; and provided students with opportunities to be autonomous. Students engaged in the activities in the engineering unit and their interest level slightly increased. The results suggest that the three strategies that the teacher used to teach engineering and science are important foundations of integrated science and engineering education.

AB  - Modern level of informational technologies development allows the authors of educational courses to decrease their dependence from technical specialists and to independently develop distance-learning courses and their separate online components, which require special methodical learning. The aim of present study is to develop a distance-learning course in linguistics with regard to the specifics of the course that uses modern informational technologies. Scientific and methodic significance of the study consists in the fact that the developed online course is an innovative representation of the results of methodic and scientific research work of teachers and students. Therefore, it expands their opportunities to participate in the university's innovative activity, along with the educational and research activities. Within the presented project we plan to transfer the communicative-activity paradigm of learning into practice of distance forms of organizing students' independent work and to model a new educational product (online component of the course) on the basis of these results with consequent integration in educational process.

AB  - Although efforts are being made to bring science closer to secondary school students, science is still mostly perceived within stereotypic frameworks, hindering students' identification with it. In this paper, we claim the role that arts-based approaches can play in science education to break these biased views and understandings and generate a more motivating science learning experience. For that purpose, we analyse research conducted with students from two secondary schools in Barcelona participating in a science education project applying drama-based activities within an inquiry process with early-career researchers. More specifically, we explore students' perceptions of science and their attitudes towards learning science at school and pursuing scientific careers. We then evaluate and discuss how the triad 'researchers' interaction -- scientific inquiry -- artistic creation' can potentially challenge their storylines about science and bring science learning closer to them. Findings suggest that the evaluated approach contributed to progress in this direction through two mechanisms: creating new rapports with science by offering a creative, inclusive and interactive learning experience, and broadening students' perceptions in terms of what implies to do science and who can do it.

AB  - In light of profound socio-economic and technological changes, the research from New Literacies has raised fundamental questions on the nature of literacy in the way we read, write, and communicate. Yet, in science education, research in literacy has been largely restricted to the domain of print-oriented academic language. This paper aims to set the issues of literacy in science education in a broader context by responding to several challenges raised in New Literacies research: (a) the attention to youths' diverse cultural and media practices, (b) the sociocultural practices of specific discourse communities, and (c) the increasing multimodal semiotic landscape. The paper presents a model that synthesizes various research areas in New Literacies for the development of new pedagogy and classroom practices in the nexus of literacy and science education. The proposed model provides a convergence of diverse theoretical perspectives from research in various disciplines, and presents an opportunity for cross-disciplinary research in both science and literacy education.

AB  - The scientific process is nonlinear, unpredictable, and ongoing. Assessing the nature of science is difficult with methods that rely on Likert-scale or multiple-choice questions. This study evaluated conceptions about the scientific process using student-created visual representations that we term "flowcharts." The methodology, Scientific Process Flowchart Assessment (SPFA), consisted of a prompt and rubric that was designed to assess students' understanding of the scientific process. Forty flowcharts representing a multidisciplinary group without intervention and 26 flowcharts representing pre- and postinstruction were evaluated over five dimensions: connections, experimental design, reasons for doing science, nature of science, and interconnectivity. Pre to post flowcharts showed a statistically significant improvement in the number of items and ratings for the dimensions. Comparison of the terms used and connections between terms on student flowcharts revealed an enhanced and more nuanced understanding of the scientific process, especially in the areas of application to society and communication within the scientific community. We propose that SPFA can be used in a variety of circumstances, including in the determination of what curricula or interventions would be useful in a course or program, in the assessment of curriculum, or in the evaluation of students performing research projects.

AB  - At its simplest, paint pouring is the mixing of paints with lower density and viscosity liquids and then pouring them onto a surface for an aesthetic artifact. Using active art as a teaching tool, middle school students were engaged in a paint pouring activity to study the influence of the interdisciplinary combination of chemistry and art topics on student understanding of density, viscosity, and creativity. It is accepted that hands-on activities increase the understanding of complex topics because students are able to apply these topics to real-world applications. Survey analysis (N = 124) of a pre- and post-event survey with 14 Likert scale questions broken into the following categories: density, science and creativity, viscosity, and art. The pre- and post-surveys included three multiple-choice questions indicating that student's understanding of the importance of density and viscosity in art increased after completing the activity. Of the 14 Likert scale questions, 11 showed an increased self-reported understanding of the scientific concepts and enthusiasm for art after engaging in the paint pouring exercise. Three responses did not increase, as the students already wanted to complete a paint pour and recognized paint pouring as an art activity. It was also observed that, after completing the exercise, students were receptive to how science and art can be integrated. Correct student responses to the multiple choice all increased in the post-survey, providing evidence for the self-reported increased student understanding of density and viscosity.

AB  - Many newsworthy events have brought with them scientific developments that have furthered the knowledge and understanding of the world and impacted life today. Events such as these can provide the perfect way to link history with science and provide children with the opportunity to make the connection between science and everyday life. As Primary Science Teaching Trust (PSTT) mentors for the North West Area of England (Michele) and North Wales Region (Kathy), along with teacher Naomi Shallcross, have developed a set of resources based on key historical eras: 1066, 1666 and 1966. Science lies at the heart of these resources and the structure encourages progression in understanding, highlights the 'working scientifically' elements and links directly to the National Curriculum in England programmes of study for science and history (DfE, 2013a,b). Throughout each of the resources presented, careful consideration has been given to developing science enquiry skills, all linked to the history context. It is the authors' belief that using science as a vehicle for teaching history brings positives and allows relevance and continuity for both subjects.

AB  - Jamestown is at the heart of any teaching and learning of colonial American history. Stories of John Smith and Pocahontas are learned by elementary and secondary students across the United States. In Virginia, Jamestown is first taught in third grade and revisited five more times from historical, political, economic, and geographic perspectives. However, the history of Jamestown is taught principally as a place, a series of events, and people from long ago with little consideration of its place in the world today. The reality is that Jamestown Island, the location of the first permanent English settlement in the Americas, is today part of a thriving metropolitan area of approximately 1.7 million people. By examining a local policy issue such as plans to build power transmission lines across the James River in Virginia, students can investigate significant questions related to urban sprawl and the environment.

AB  - We developed a summer research experience program within a freestanding comprehensive cancer center to cultivate undergraduate students with an interest in and an aptitude for quantitative sciences focused on oncology. This unconventional location for an undergraduate program is an ideal setting for interdisciplinary training in the intersection of oncology, statistics, and epidemiology. This article describes the development and implementation of a hands-on research experience program in this unique environment. Core components of the program include faculty-mentored projects, instructional programs to improve research skills and domain knowledge, and professional development activities. We discuss key considerations such as fostering effective partnership between research and administrative units, recruiting students, and identifying faculty mentors with quantitative projects. We describe evaluation approaches and discuss post-program outcomes and lessons learned. In its initial two years, the program successfully improved the students' perception of competence gained in research skills and statistical knowledge across several knowledge domains. The majority of students also went on to pursue graduate degrees in a quantitative field or work in oncology-centric academic research roles. Our research-based training model can be adapted by a variety of organizations motivated to develop a summer research experience program in quantitative sciences for undergraduate students. Supplemental files for this article are available online.

AB  - Project-based learning and interdisciplinary projects present an opportunity for students to learn both technical skills and other skills which are relevant to their workplace success. This paper presents an assessment of the educational impact of the OpenOrbiter program, a student-run, interdisciplinary CubeSat (a type of small satellite with dimensions of 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm and a mass of 1.33 kg) development program at the University of North Dakota, on participants with a major in computer science. The value of the program to participants is assessed in terms of key metrics through a comparison of their pre-participation and present-day levels. Particular focus is paid to identifying and quantifying the benefit of the program to students with a computer science major. The educational value of the program to computer science students is compared and contrasted to the value to students of other majors. The impact is assessed relative to their type of participation, duration of participation and other factors.

AB  - The aim of the research is to determine the peculiarities of the evaluative categorization of human intelligence in linguistic world images. The study describes the interdisciplinary approach to studying evaluative categorization, which assumes the use of complex methodology including the anthropocentric, the interdisciplinary, and the cognitive principles. The paper suggests a modified cognitive procedure of evaluation, based on determining and using cognitive classification features, and differential abilities of subjects, based on the consideration of their ethnic experience. Research findings can be used in studies on the evaluative categorization of any objects of reality and during the systematization of evaluative linguistic phenomena as a modus representation of knowledge of objects and phenomena in the world.

AB  - The Federal University of São Paulo, Baixada Santista Campus was founded in 2006 with five degree-granting programs in physical education, physiotherapy, nutrition, psychology, and occupational therapy. The guiding principle behind the programs' educational mission was centered on the development of health care professionals capable of working in interdisciplinary teams with an emphasis on holistic patient care. This pedagogical structure required peer-mentoring programs in order to integrate different areas of knowledge and to improve learning strategies among new generations of students. The authors' objective in the present report is to discuss the strategies and activities of the peer-mentoring program in histophysiology and gross anatomy in an interdisciplinary and interprofessional curriculum. Evaluations by students, mentors and professors are presented, along with a statistical analysis of variance comparing student performance in the module assessments according to their participation in the peer-mentoring activities. The results demonstrated that students who participated in peer-mentoring activities enjoyed a higher rate of academic success than those who did not participate. In addition, student and mentor evaluations of the peer mentoring program were highly positive. The program enabled mentors to gain a deeper knowledge of the subjects addressed in the learning modules, as well as to develop intrinsic teaching skills during their time as mentors. In short, the authors believe that the peer-mentoring program has been validated for its effectiveness in raising student academic performance.

AB  - Background and Context: Non-traditional training grounds such as coding boot camps that attract a higher proportion of women are important sites for understanding how to broaden participation in computing. Objective: This work aims to help us better understand the women choosing boot camps and their pathways through these camps and into the computing workforce. Method: This paper reports on a longitudinal, qualitative study investigating female boot camp attendees. Findings: Findings show that women attending boot camps are career changers that develop an interest in software development too late to major in CS, discovering a post-college enjoyment of programming undertaken to support work goals at a current job or an aspirational job. Implications: Women at boot camps illustrate a missed opportunity to diversify postsecondary CS classrooms when not recruited early, not given interdisciplinary options, not exposed to enjoyable programming tasks, and not exposed to the array and number of job prospects.

AB  - STEM integration has often been recommended as a way to support students to develop twenty-first century skills needed to function in the complex modern world. In order for students to experience integration, however, their teachers need support in designing, developing and implementing integrated curricular instruction, which is often at odds with a very subject-focused educational system. This paper reports on the second year of a research study conducted with five secondary science and mathematics teachers, concerned with supporting them to teach explicitly the mathematics components within science lessons, mediated via technology. It outlines how the teachers collaborated with the support of science and mathematics education researchers within a community of practice, named a Teaching and Learning Network (TLN). The network was intended to promote and enhance teacher capacity for the interdisciplinary teaching of mathematics in science in the face of various contextual and other obstacles observed in the first year of the study. This study found that the opportunity to work in a Teaching and Learning Network supported the teachers' ownership of the design of the integrated learning unit, enhanced their content knowledge of mathematics, their use of the data logging technology and their understanding of an inquiry-based pedagogical approach. Participation in the TLN provided teachers with the mechanism to cross the boundaries of the subject disciplines and thereby promoted change in their attitudes, professional knowledge and to some extent, practice.

AB  - Helping students understand "chemical energy" is notoriously difficult. Many hold inconsistent ideas about what energy is, how and why it changes during the course of a chemical reaction, and how these changes are related to bond energies and reaction dynamics. There are (at least) three major sources for this problem: 1) the way biologists talk about chemical energy (which is also the way we talk about energy in everyday life); 2) the macroscopic approach to energy concepts that is common in physics and physical sciences; and 3) the failure of chemistry courses to explicitly link molecular with macroscopic energy ideas. From a constructivist perspective, it is unlikely that students can, without a coherent understanding of such a central concept, attain a robust and accurate understanding of new concepts. However, changes are on the horizon, guided by the increasing understanding that difficult concepts require coherent, well-designed learning progressions and the new National Research Council Framework for K-12 Science Education. We provide supporting evidence for our assertions and suggestions for an interdisciplinary learning progression designed to better approach the concept of bond energies, a first step in an understanding chemical energy and behavior of reaction systems that is central to biological systems.

AB  - This primarily online Master's degree program focused on advancing K-8 teachers' interdisciplinary mathematical and science content knowledge while integrating appropriate digital technologies as learning and teaching tools. The mixed-method, interpretive study examined in-service teachers' technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) within the context of interdisciplinary content knowledge, pedagogical strategies for teaching interdisciplinary topics, and technological knowledge when applied to teaching and learning interdisciplinary content. The results documented ways specific coursework in the graduate program impacted the teachers' overarching conceptions of teaching interdisciplinary topics, their knowledge of students' understanding and thinking, their instructional strategies, and their knowledge of curriculum and curriculum materials for learning in interdisciplinary contexts with the integration of appropriate technologies.

AB  - As part of a Howard Hughes Program for Innovation in Science Education grant at Iowa State University, a series of interdisciplinary graduate teaching assistant learning communities (TALC) were developed. The purpose of these communities was to create an environment to facilitate teaching assistants' pedagogical development and training to enhance the implementation of inquiry experiences in the undergraduate laboratories. The TALC evaluated in this study were held for two consecutive semesters and included teaching assistants who facilitated multiweek course based research experiences in their respective STEM courses.Topics discussed during the TALC were based on the teaching assistants' concerns related to teaching this type of course. Evaluation consisted of weekly reflection responses, a pre- and postsurvey of instructional methods they consider to facilitate inquiry, pre-post definitions of inquiry-based instruction, and end-of-semester evaluations of the learning community experiences. This article outlines the development of the TALC and findings from the various forms of evaluation.

AB  - This study investigated students' perceptions of their graduate learning outcomes including content knowledge, communication, writing, teamwork, quantitative skills, and ethical thinking in two Australian universities. One university has a traditional discipline-orientated curriculum and the other, an interdisciplinary curriculum in the entry semester of first year. The Science Students Skills Inventory asked students (n = 613) in first and final years to rate their perceptions of the importance of developing graduate learning outcomes within the programme; how much they improved their graduate learning outcomes throughout their undergraduate science programme; how much they saw learning outcomes included in the programme; and how confident they were about their learning outcomes. A framework of progressive curriculum development was adopted to interpret results. Students in the discipline-oriented degree programme reported higher perceptions of scientific content knowledge and ethical thinking while students from the interdisciplinary curriculum indicated higher perceptions of oral communication and teamwork. Implications for curriculum development include ensuring progressive development from first to third years, a need for enhanced focus on scientific ethics, and career opportunities from first year onwards.

AB  - A national movement is underway to establish elementary school gardens, which can serve both academic and social purposes. These gardens can positively impact students' science achievement and provide the thematic and hands-on approach especially conducive to learning for students with disabilities. Garden-based learning (GBL) broadens the scope of school gardening to include tools and processes such as indoor seed germination and vermicomposting. Teachers at a suburban elementary school leveraged community resources and the assistance of parents to initiate GBL. They employed this strategy to provide standards-based science and cross-disciplinary instruction, as well as to facilitate inquiry and the development of related process skills. A collaborative fourth grade classroom engaged all learners in investigations about the decomposition of vegetable matter, worm populations, and the impact of fertilizer on plant growth. The experiential and interdisciplinary nature of GBL may make it one key to unlocking learning potential in students with disabilities. (Contains 1 table and 4 figures.)

AB  - Organic agriculture courses and degrees in higher education have become more common in recent decades. In this article, we characterized instructor priorities for organic agriculture education and identified critical concepts and skills to be included in curriculum. We used interviews and surveys to learn from 19 instructors from universities and colleges in the United States. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded for frequency of mentions. The critical concepts most frequently mentioned by instructors were soils, ecological principles, and certification standards. The topics that instructors most frequently mentioned covering occasionally or not at all included social dimensions, climate change, and livestock production. Instructors frequently mentioned the challenges of lack of teaching materials specific to organic agriculture and lack of expertise, given the multidisciplinary span of organic agriculture. Including guest lectures was mentioned as a way to cover topics where instructors felt they had less knowledge or expertise. Instructors stated that the most challenging topics and skills for students to learn included systems thinking, managing nutrients, and performing fertilizer calculations. Our summary highlights the specific concepts that instructors across the United States prioritize in their teaching, laying the groundwork for future curriculum development. They offer valuable insight into the challenges and successes in organic agriculture teaching.

AB  - Sustainability is becoming a key component of many HE curricula. However, questions as to what sustainability is and how it can be embedded within subject specific curriculum are difficult to answer. Focussing on existing pedagogic scholarship in this area and by drawing on experiences from my own institution, this article discusses how the GEES subjects are addressing sustainability in the curriculum. It provides both conceptual framing on the evolution of the GEES subjects in relation to sustainability and offers some practical examples of how different approaches to sustainability might be used in teaching, including challenging disciplinary perspectives and introducing interdisciplinary working around global challenges. It concludes with recommendations for how sustainability might be embedded in the curriculum in practice.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions around the world were forced to close and the academic process continued online. Online teaching can support students' learning, but little research exists in the foundational early primary years (children aged 4-8). The purpose of this study was to investigate teachers' practices and experiences in implementing online teaching during the pandemic period. The participants were 14 Greek teachers of early primary years, and data were collected via interviews. The findings indicated that most of the teachers used a combination of teaching practices-approaches, while the learning activities implemented mainly regarded language, psychomotor activities, display of videos, mathematics and interdisciplinary activities. Teachers' feelings were initially negative, while afterwards they experienced more positive feelings. Disadvantages of online education, as experienced by teachers, mainly regarded technical problems, followed by limited resources/support for children at home, and limited training in online methodology. Teachers' positive experiences regarded children's familiarization with the technology and maintenance of contact with the school environment, while the role of the parents was revealed as essential. Implications and suggestions for future online education in early primary years include maintenance of good high-standard teaching practices, enhancement of digital culture and parents' involvement with children's activities at home.

AB  - Research has shown that hands-on projects promote stem education, namely via problem-solving. CanSat, literally 'satellite in a can', is a stem educational project promoted by the European Space Agency. This paper addresses this issue by researching this STEM project and trying to understand how secondary students solve problems in the STEM CanSat project. We use qualitative techniques of data collection and analysis. The results showed that students used sophisticated thinking strategies to process information within this interdisciplinary project: (a) cognitive testing, cognitive organization, cognitive regulation, and monitoring, in addition to computer language and physical-mathematical calculations, are cognitive and metacognitive behavior strategies revealed in the CanSat; (b) problem-solving was suggested as a specific model, where students' higher cognitive and metacognitive ordering processes deepen in project development; (c) computational, lateral, or divergent and convergent thinking were detected as thinking types of students associated with and mobilized in the course of problem-solving. The findings of this research have practical implications for STEM education in space science. Hands-on projects using problem-solving are an essential strategy to promote STEM. This project reinforces this. Additionally, they are a starting point to promote meaningful learning and new thinking types.

AB  - Background: Blending collaborative learning and project-based learning (PBL) based on Wolff (2003) design categories, students interacted in a learning environment where they developed their technology integration practices as well as their technological and collaborative skills. Purpose: The study aims to understand how seventh grade students perceive a collaborative web-based science project in light of Wolff's design categories. The goal of the project is to develop their technological and collaborative skills, to educate them about technology integration practices, and to provide an optimum collaborative, PBL experience. Sample: Seventh grade students aged 12-14 (n = 15) were selected from a rural K-12 school in Turkey through purposeful sampling. Design and methods: The current study applied proactive action research since it focused on utilizing a new way to enhance students' technological and collaborative skills and to demonstrate technology integration into science coursework. Data were collected qualitatively through interviews, observation forms, forum archives, and website evaluation rubrics. Results: The results found virtual spaces such as online tutorials, forums, and collaborative and communicative tools to be beneficial for collaborative PBL. The study supported Wolff's design features for a collaborative PBL environment, applying features appropriate for a rural K-12 school setting and creating a digitally-enriched environment. As the forum could not be used as effectively as expected because of school limitations, more flexible spaces independent of time and space were needed. Conclusions: This study's interdisciplinary, collaborative PBL was efficient in enhancing students' advanced technological and collaborative skills, as well as exposing them to practices for integrating technology into science. The study applied design features for a collaborative PBL environment with certain revisions.

AB  - This paper focuses on how wise humanising creativity (WHC) is manifested within early years interdisciplinary arts education. It draws on Arts Council-funded participatory research by Devon Carousel Project and University of Exeter's Graduate School of Education. It is grounded in previous AHRC-funded research, which conceptualised WHC in the face of educational creativity/performativity tensions. WHC articulates the dialogic embodied inter-relationship of creativity and identity--creators are "making and being made"; they are "becoming." The research used a qualitative methodology to create open-ended spaces of dialogue or "Living Dialogic Spaces" framed by an ecological model to situate the team's different positionings. Data collection included traditional qualitative techniques and arts-based techniques. Data analysis involved inductive/deductive conversations between existing theory and emergent themes. Analysis indicated that "making and being made," and other key WHC features were manifested. We conclude by suggesting that WHC can help develop understanding of how creative arts practice supports the breadth of young children's development, and the role of the creativity-identity dialogue within that, as well as indicating what the practice and research has to offer beyond the Early Years.

AB  - Interprofessional education (IPE) and entrustable professional activities (EPAs) represent two topics in health professions education that have attracted significant attention in recent years. IPE (when different health professionals learn with, from and about each other with the aim of optimal care) has an inherent focus on the collective. EPAs (units of professional practice that can be fully entrusted to a trainee, once he or she has demonstrated the necessary competence to execute this activity unsupervised) have a focus on the individual. Attempts to relate the two may cause friction and the question is: can they be reconciled? Are interprofessional EPAs or team-EPAs useful concepts and if so what should they look like? The authors argue that most work in modern healthcare involves interprofessional collaboration. Some EPAs have an inherent strong interprofessional nature, such as emergency teamwork, running multidisciplinary team meetings, and surgery. Other EPAs are less inherently dependent on interprofessional collaboration. The authors conclude that neither interprofessional team-EPAs (for which a team can or should be certified), nor IP-EPAs for individuals, as opposed to other EPAs, are viable concepts. However, the authors do not question that certifying health care professionals and entrusting trainees with most clinical tasks will require to ascertain their competence in interprofessional collaboration. This must be included when assessing learners for most EPAs and making entrustment decisions. This can help to strengthen interprofessional competence in the clinical workplace.

AB  - National Research Council polices (NRC, 2012a, 2012b) and the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) of 2015 (Pub. L. No. 114-145) call for educators to have active roles in teaching to achieve new goals and purposes for education. A high priority is teaching content knowledge and information fluency skills that will result in deep learning, higher order thinking, and college and career readiness. Information fluency involves abilities to find, evaluate and use print and digital information effectively, efficiently and ethically to create knowledge useful in solving real-world problems. This action research (Blaxter, Hughes, and Tight, 2010) investigates co-teaching in a college, undergraduate physical sciences course. Information and technology literacy skills (ACRL, 2016) were taught in the context of a 12-week unit about the design of control variable experiments. Co-teaching was done by a professor of physical sciences and a professor of library and information science. Assignment learning objectives provided a framework for analysis of 24 students' scores that tells a story of the process of co-teaching through articulation of two professors' engagement in instructional interactions, creation of materials and strategies to increase information fluency as well as descriptions of students' completion of assignments. It was concluded that co-teaching effectiveness involves intensity of effort in shared planning, organization, delivery and assessment of instruction; shared physical and/or virtual space of instruction; and in the combining two areas of academic expertise in delivery of cross-curricular instruction.

AB  - Place-based education (PBE) is a situated, context-rich, transdisciplinary teaching and learning modality distinguished by its unequivocal relationship to place, which is any locality that people have imbued with meanings and personal attachments through actual or vicarious experiences. As an observational and historical science, geoscience is highly dependent on place, and place-based curricula and instructional methods apply to geoscience education. The sense of place operationalizes the human connection to place and functions as a definable and measurable learning outcome for PBE. Although PBE is rooted in historic and indigenous teaching philosophies, it has gained particular notice and traction in concert with more recent interest in environmental education, sustainability, and diversity in geoscience. This paper presents a current review of theory and research methods that have directly informed development of curriculum and instruction in, authentic assessment of, and implementation of PBE in geoscience sensu lato (Earth-system and environmental sciences); a survey of place-based teaching in geoscience currently or recently practiced across different grade levels and situated in different places, regions, and cultures; information about teaching and assessment methods for those who may be interested in adopting the place-based modality; and suggested future directions for research, practice, and assessment in PBE in geoscience.

AB  - There is a prevalent consensus among science education scholars that teaching socioscientific issues (SSI) has notable importance for promoting functional scientific literacy and raising responsible citizens. However, teachers encounter numerous problems when teaching SSI, so they may not prefer to teach them. Today, we still do not know many specific particulars about how teachers' own opinions, beliefs, or experiences influence the way in which they present controversies and which teacher's role is best suited for teaching SSI. This paper aims to review the empirical studies that include teachers' stances during teaching SSI and, if stated, their rationales about preferred stances. We employed the Web of Science and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) databases and Google Scholar to find the relevant literature. Then, we independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the selected studies for eligibility. Based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement checklist, eighteen empirical studies were included in this review. Three main profiles of teachers' positions while addressing SSI were identified: excluders, neutrals, and disclosers. Two subprofiles were identified for both neutrals and disclosers. Neutral teaching was found to be the most adopted and preferred teacher position for introducing SSI. It was followed by the avoidance of SSI teaching because the teachers viewed value-free education as important. Teachers' own opinions, beliefs, epistemological orientations, concerns of indoctrination, and external factors were reported as the main underlying reasons for their preferred positions. Obviously, the studies conducted with in-service teachers yielded different reasoning patterns for their neutrality. We concluded that, given the pedagogical and epistemological challenges of teaching SSI, more research on teachers' positions in addressing SSI in science classrooms is needed.

AB  - An interdisciplinary group of faculty members from Tufts University developed an undergraduate civic science course designed to help students better understand and interpret the broad, sociocultural impacts of science. The course teaches principles of civic science and was designed around four facets of learning. These facets lay groundwork for students to fully explore, through dialogue and writing, connections between science, personal values, and civic life. We present an overview of the course structure, challenges and goals, and student feedback from surveys and focus groups about the impact of the course. Students developed an appreciation that science is accessible, personal, relevant, and indispensable to their civic lives--especially those with interests in the humanities and social sciences. Students also learned a "working language" of a science issue and an understanding of the personal relevance of an issue in ways that informed their personal and professional lives. The approach frames science learning around real-world issues of personal relevance that challenge students to find personal and civic solutions to society's most daunting problems that exist at the nexus of science, technology, and society.

AB  - The concept of energy is widely employed in introductory science courses. However, the term energy is defined and utilized in different ways depending on the context, even within a given discipline. Through the lens of metaphor theory, these various definitions of energy are seen as metaphors that highlight and obscure characteristics of energy. Working under this framework, undergraduate students in introductory biology, chemistry, and physics courses were asked to write analogies that reflect their understanding of the role of energy in the context of ecosystems (n?=?49), chemical reactions (n?=?36), mechanical systems (n?=?65), and electrical circuits (n?=?44). These analogies were analyzed qualitatively using metaphor theory to gain understanding of how students conceptualize energy in these different contexts. The results of this study indicate that students use seven different conceptual metaphors to explain the role of energy in various scientific contexts: energy as a substance that can be accounted for, energy as a substance that can flow, can change forms, can be carried, can be lost, can be an ingredient or a product, and energy as a process or interaction. This result gives teachers a framework to use in evaluating student ideas about energy.

AB  - Maintaining an active research agenda while teaching full-time at a community college can be daunting, but with institutional support for scholarly research by way of course release it is possible. This personal reflection offers up evidence of institutional support from a variety of sources within the public university system of New York City, the City University of New York (CUNY), including that from LaGuardia Community College itself, senior colleges, NEH Grants, and contractually mandated course release by the faculty and staff union, PSC-CUNY. This reflection does not offer a comprehensive account of the working conditions of community colleges across the United States in general. I close my reflection with a brief description of how teaching at LaGuardia Community College has transformed by teaching and research from disciplinary to interdisciplinary. I also thank APSA's Committee on the Status of Community Colleges in the Profession for including and highlighting community college political science professors' contributions as an important part of the national organization.

AB  - In the last 5 years, there have been several literature reviews or meta-analyses investigating various aspects of STEM education; however, they have investigated a specific aspect of STEM, e.g. robotics, or digital games, or Early childhood, or Teacher perspectives. In addition, a broad-reaching review on STEM integration has not been conducted in the past 10 years. This article reports findings from a Systematic Qualitative Literature Review concerning STEM education for children aged 4-12 in formal education contexts. To provide context, the article initially presents descriptive findings (date and country of research, age of participants, research setting, and research methodologies used) in the 60 research articles that are included for analysis. The article then answers three research questions regarding the: (1) level of integration evident in the studies; (2) role of engineering in any such integration; and (3) teaching approaches used in the studies. Findings from this research suggest that there is still much work to be done to move from scenarios where STEM integration is claimed but is not evident in practice. To do so we encourage educators and researchers to (a) focus on authentic interdisciplinary approaches rather than the siloed approaches evident in the existing research; and (b) use a teaching approach such as problem-based or project-based learning that provide opportunities for authentic integration.

AB  - Scientific knowledge is growing rapidly, particularly in biochemistry, an interdisciplinary subject in which the courses attract diverse students with varied disciplinary interests and career goals. Thus, there is a need to teach skills and concepts in biochemistry in a way that is both compelling to a variety of learners and also relevant to careers in science, health, and related areas. This article describes a pair of literature-based group writing assignments developed for a two-semester biochemistry sequence with 30-50 students per section. Adaptable to application in many biochemistry courses, these projects reinforce core threshold concepts while teaching information literacy skills and connecting to biochemistry applications in medicine and technology. Strategies for structured instruction and management prior to and during work on the assignments are presented for instructors in order to maximize student success and impact. While writing assignments have become commonplace in upper-division biology courses, such a matched pair of mini-review assignments for a two-semester biochemistry sequence interweaving information literacy, core concepts, and applications has not been reported previously. Improved performance from the first to second semester indicates that these assignments help students learn skills that are useful for self-directed learning.

The motivation for the various elements of interdisciplinary degrees is often very low in computer science, which faces a gender gap as well. Differences between study courses and gender in confidence, attitude, student numbers, and motivation in computer science are investigated. In addition, the influences of attitude, perception, and social background are considered. A questionnaire was designed based on an extensive research model for the purpose of this research. A survey was conducted with two cohorts of computer science non-major freshmen from two degrees in an introductory programming class at a university of applied sciences. The outcomes are compared against each other. First, an explorative factor analysis was performed. Afterwards, SmartPLS was used to test the developed model. The overall motivation of the participants is moderate and mostly influenced by their ability and effort beliefs. These constructs are different for men and women, but not for the degree programs, and have different impacts on motivation. In general, motivation is influenced by ability and effort beliefs, which in turn are mostly affected by perception and social background. While women show lower ability and higher effort beliefs, the males in the samples have opposite outcomes and thus a higher motivation in introductory programming classes.

AB  - The need to manage, analyze, and extract knowledge from data is pervasive across industry, government, and academia. Scientists, engineers, and executives routinely encounter enormous volumes of data, and new techniques and tools are emerging to create knowledge out of these data, some of them capable of working with real-time streams of data. The nation's ability to make use of these data depends on the availability of an educated workforce with necessary expertise. With these new capabilities have come novel ethical challenges regarding the effectiveness and appropriateness of broad applications of data analyses. The field of data science has emerged to address the proliferation of data and the need to manage and understand it. Data science is a hybrid of multiple disciplines and skill sets, draws on diverse fields (including computer science, statistics, and mathematics), encompasses topics in ethics and privacy, and depends on specifics of the domains to which it is applied. Fueled by the explosion of data, jobs that involve data science have proliferated and an array of data science programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels have been established. Nevertheless, data science is still in its infancy, which suggests the importance of envisioning what the field might look like in the future and what key steps can be taken now to move data science education in that direction. This study will set forth a vision for the emerging discipline of data science at the undergraduate level. This interim report lays out some of the information and comments that the committee has gathered and heard during the first half of its study, offers perspectives on the current state of data science education, and poses some questions that may shape the way data science education evolves in the future. The study will conclude in early 2018 with a final report that lays out a vision for future data science education.

AB  - The interdisciplinary nature of robotics allows mobile robots to be used successfully in a broad range of courses at the postgraduate level and in Ph.D. research. Practical industrial-like mobile robotic demonstrations encourage students and increase their motivation by providing them with learning benefits not achieved with traditional educational robotic platforms. This paper presents VEGO, an industrial-like modular vehicle platform for robotic education with an appropriate infrastructure that has been demonstrated to be very useful at the postgraduate level. Besides learning engineering concepts, in performing industrial-like exercises, students develop valuable skills such as teamwork and the capacity to solve problems similar to those they may encounter in a real industrial environment. The developed infrastructure represents a valuable platform for robotic education that can be used in many different disciplines as a way to demonstrate how to cope with the difficulties and challenges related to the development of industrial infrastructure systems. The platform evaluation proved its ability to inculcate the expected engineering skills. A novel approach is adopted through the use of multidisciplinary and close-to-industrial-reality platforms developed under an incremental approach and using an open and customizable structure.

AB  - This study investigates early childhood teachers' views about science teaching practices in an early childhood settings. It was conducted in a preschool located in Ankara, Turkey. The data of the study were collected through multiple sources of information such as interviews with early childhood teachers and observations of their practices in the classroom. The findings of this study indicated that early childhood teachers believed in the importance of science activities in their practices and they claimed that they provided child-centred activities for children to enrich their science experiences. Moreover, the findings showed that they used different learning experiences that were naturalistic, informal, and structured. The findings also revealed that an integrated curriculum improved children's developmental progress. More specifically, participant teachers used art as an assessment tool in science activities because they considered that they were able to evaluate children's understanding on the basis of their art work such as their drawings.

AB  - As we have come to accept the duality of physical and virtual learning spaces as a permanent feature of our educational landscape, we begin to question its validity. Is this really a dichotomy, or is it a continuum? Should this be the primary dimension around which we cluster educational experiences -- how does it intersect and interact with other axes, such as formal-informal, vocational-recreational, open-closed, teacher-student? How do we adapt, as teachers, learners, designers, policy makers, to this changing landscape? How do we shape it to offer an optimal learning experience? Such questions led us to conduct a series of academic and professional events on the theme of Hybrid Learning Spaces (HLS) -- spaces which challenge and defy the dichotomies above. This edited book collates some of the products of that endeavor, offering a multi-vocal, interdisciplinary approach to hybridity in education. It connects practical examples, design directives and theoretical analysis, combining perspectives from technology research and development, educational theory and practice, architecture and space and product design. This book addresses researchers, practitioners, innovators and policy makers in education, technology and design, offering broad perspectives and then distilling practical insights in the form of design principles and patterns, pedagogical models, and predictions of future trends.

AB  - Purpose: This study reports the process and results of a professional development program (PDP) carried out with science, mathematics and technology (SMT) teachers throughout Thailand. Method: One hundred and three teachers participated and completed the professional development program which is comprised five of phases: (1) commit to a vision and standard, (2) develop theoretical-based lesson plans, (3) participate in a four-day workshop, (4) implement and follow-up, and (5) conduct of teacher conference and lesson learned from evidence-based teaching. Findings: The results showed that most SMT teachers were able to design teaching plans consistent with the goals of improving critical thinking and problem-solving skills and designed activities in the form of integrated multidisciplinary learning activities. All SMT teachers adopted real-life situations as learning activities, engaging students and allowing them to learn through a contextual basis. However, some teachers remained unclear on how to transform general rubrics to the task-specific rubrics needed for an accurate assessment. Significance: The research finding showed that the PDP could improve the understanding of Thai SMT teachers' concepts in regard to both thinking and problem-solving skills. Training teachers generated useful insights from the PDP allowing them to help better design instruction programs in the future to further help bridge the gap between expected performance and current teaching practices.

AB  - Teacher qualifications are a crucial element for successfully implementing integrated STEM education. Research suggests that a STEM education program should be compulsory for all STEM-related teachers. In this study, as STEM education researchers, we asked teachers from different disciplines about their expectations from a professional development (PD) program for integrated STEM education. Six hundred sixty-four teachers participated in the study. We examined the PD expectations of middle school science, mathematics, and computer science teachers regarding pedagogical knowledge, technological knowledge, benefits, and PD program design. In addition, we discussed how these expectations changed based on teachers' subjects. Qualitative data were analyzed through content analysis. In terms of pedagogical knowledge, teachers want to use innovative approaches while integrating ICT into the learning and teaching process. Teachers' expectations of developing ICT competencies in terms of technological knowledge are at the forefront. In the design of such programs, the most critical expectations of teachers are to provide collaborative working environments, thus increasing their opportunities to work with colleagues from different disciplines and their capacity to do interdisciplinary work. Teachers' willingness to participate in a PD program related to integrated STEM education has four underlying expectations: student benefit, professional benefit, personal benefit, and context benefit. Teachers' expectations vary according to the subject area.

AB  - As the importance of interdisciplinary studies is on the rise, countries have developed innovative educational approaches. One of these innovative approaches is STEM. STEM focuses on interdisciplinary cooperation, systematic thinking, openness to communication, ethical values, research, production, creativity and problems, focusing on the intersection of knowledge and skills in science, technology, mathematics and engineering, it is a new learning teaching approach that aims to gain the ability to solve. In this context, the aim of this study is to evaluate the attitudes of the pre-service teachers towards STEM and STEM's sub dimensions. Therefore; it was used as a data collection tool from attitude scale for Stem and Stem's sub dimensions developed by Keles, Kiremit and Aktamis (2017). In the data collection tool, 5 scales were developed in order to reveal the existence of the relationship between pre-service teachers' attitudes towards STEM and their attitudes towards; science, technology, mathematics and engineering. The related scale was applied to 204 pre-service teachers in various departments of the Faculty of Education at Sakarya University. In the research, the necessary correlations were made by considering the demographic characteristics such as gender, age and class of teacher candidates. The overall average and standard deviation values are taken into account, when explaining the data differences for the sub-dimensions of the scale. According to the results obtained from the relevant data collection tool, when pre-service teachers' attitudes towards STEM and STEM sub-dimensions were evaluated; especially in the Mathematics and Engineering dimensions, it was revealed that their attitudes were more positive and they were indecisive in other dimensions (Science and Technology). As a result, it is thought that the acceptance of STEM method by teacher candidate, which is an innovative educational approach of the research results, will contribute to the literature and the future studies in this field.

AB  - A traditional classroom usually focuses on concepts from a specific discipline. However, solving complex real-world problems requires integration and application of knowledge from various fields. Here, we describe a 4-hr undergraduate-level laboratory exercise that utilizes concepts of extraction and biological property, bridging between chemistry and microbiology courses. In the first half of this exercise, students performed hydrodistillation to extract essential oil from a locally available herb, lemongrass ("Cymbopogon citratus," Stapf). In the second half, students investigated the potential antimicrobial activity of the extracted oil against various microorganisms using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Students also developed their own experimental questions based on the extracted oil and the antimicrobial testing technique. Self-assessment questionnaire shows students' appreciation of the experiments and substantial learning gains in the extraction process, properties of the extracts, and antimicrobial activity testing. This laboratory exercise prompts students to formulate their own experimental questions and engages students in interdisciplinary experimentation.

AB  - This systematic literature review was conducted to explore the effectiveness of problem-based and project-based learning (PBL) implemented with students in early elementary to grade 8 (ages 3-14) in mathematics and science classrooms. Nine studies met the following inclusion criteria: (a) focus on PBL, (b) experimental study, (c) kindergarten to grade 8 level, and (d) focus on mathematics or science content. For these studies, we examined: the definitions of PBL used, the components of PBL explicitly identified as salient to student learning, and the effectiveness of PBL. This review found that although there is no consistent definition of PBL, PBL is an effective method for improving K-8 students' science academic achievement, including knowledge retention, conceptual development, and attitudes. Implications and limitations are discussed.

AB  - In traditional preservice teacher education programs, education courses are "add-ons" to science content courses. As a result, future teachers are taught the importance of authentic inquiry and constructivism, but they may never learn science in the way they are expected to teach it. University of California San Diego's California Teach program bridges this divide through genuine sharing of expertise between the faculty of Physical Sciences and the faculty of Education Studies in a new undergraduate program that was developed, approved, and implemented within one year. Lessons learned from the collaborative efforts to design the program have relevance to those at other institutions seeking to bridge the divide between the science and education departments or to develop other interdisciplinary academic programs. The California Teach formula for success includes five key ingredients: (a) mutual benefits, (b) recognition of distinct sets of expertise, (c) agreement on core principles, (d) willingness to negotiate, and (e) strong leadership. In concert with administrative buy-in and advocacy, science education faculty catalyzed collaboration by changing attitudes locally and across departments.

AB  - Many students in US community colleges often speak a language other than English (LOTE) at home. They find it difficult to complete college requirements, and many drop out. Struggling with the acquisition of academic English and the content of their courses, they exhibit low academic confidence and are easily frustrated. In an attempt to raise students' self-esteem and motivate them to remain enrolled, we explore plurilingual pedagogies across the college curriculum, in science, humanities, education, and linguistics courses. The four case studies presented demonstrate how we integrate dynamic translingual teaching practices such as translation, code-switching, cross-linguistic analysis, and the use of students' linguistic repertoires to complete assignments in multilingual classrooms. We have found that plurilingual pedagogies enable students to discover their linguistic strengths and utilize them to complete college assignments. As bilingual faculty we found our educational goals supported and validated through interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - In a collaboration between the University of North Florida College of Education and Human Services and Sandalwood High School in Duval County, Florida, social studies and science education professors and a science teacher worked together to develop student understanding about the limited use of diesel-fueled cars in the United States when compared to the countries of Europe. On the basis of discussions with a Sandalwood science faculty member and calls for subject matter integration from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Research Council, the National Science Teachers Association, and the National Council on the Social Studies, we developed a collaborative teaching experience to both enhance high school science instruction and build stronger professional connections between college and high school faculty. Through this instruction, high school chemistry students examined the costs and benefits of using diesel vehicles and used this analysis to explain the differences between countries. This article illustrates conceptual planning processes used in developing inquiry-based classroom activities within a standards-based curriculum.

AB  - Linux Laptop Orchestra (L2Ork), founded in 2009 in the Virginia Tech Music Department's Digital and Interactive Sound & Intermedia Studio, "explores the power of gesture, communal interaction, and the multidimensionality of arts, as well as technology's potential to seamlessly integrate arts and sciences with particular focus on K-12 education" (Bukovic 2016). L2Ork has formed a unique partnership with Virginia Tech's Integrative STEM Education department to enable students to become proficient in multiple technological literacy standards while learning computer programming to design musical scores. Students then collaborate with these scores to create complex digital music systems--the laptop orchestra. This initiative was implemented at a middle school in southwest Virginia. Participants came from the subgroup of students who attend the school's Boys and Girls Club of America afterschool program. There were ten student participants (four males and six females), aged 11-13. Prior to the first L2Ork lesson, participants completed the 16-item VARK Questionnaire for Younger People. This instrument quantified learning preferences into: Visual, Aural, Read/Write, and Kinesthetic. Most student participants exhibited a multimodal learning preference, relying on different learning types in different situations. On average, students achieved an intermediate score on the performance tasks, showing noticeable improvements in programming knowledge and skills in a relatively short time. Throughout the process students were engaged in multiple "Standards for Technological Literacy" content standards, and the following benchmarks were observed: (1) The Nature of Technology; and (2) Core Concepts of Technology. The article shares lessons learned for successful transdisciplinary collaboration and how to use L2Ork in schools.

AB  - College students are often urged to "find their passion," but if students believe that passions or interests are fixed, they may not develop interest in fields beyond the academic identity with which they enter college. Can a brief intervention that portrays interests as developable, not fixed, boost interest, and even grades, in mandatory math and science coursework among students who do not identify as a "math or science person"? This would be especially significant because college provides the foundation for developing skills and interests that guide later professional paths. After a successful pilot study at a small liberal arts college (N = 175), we conducted a randomized, controlled field-experiment with matriculating first-year undergraduates (N = 580) in the school of arts and social sciences of a large university. Students completed a 30-min growth-theory-of-interest (vs. control) online module before starting school. At the end of their first and second semesters, they reported their interest in their two required first-year math/science courses. Official final grades were obtained at the end of the year. As predicted, among those who entered college less identified with math and science, the intervention (vs. control) increased interest and final grades in both first-year math/science courses (one conditional effect was marginal). The results suggest that by representing interests as not merely "found" but as having the potential to grow, colleges can encourage the development of skilled, interdisciplinary scholars.

AB  - To assist learners in obtaining professional abilities, meet social demand for talent, and achieve favorable educational outcomes, academic courses generally have unique syllabuses, learning goals, and teaching purposes according to their characteristics and specialized knowledge and skills. Furthermore, it could help the students of Industrial Design enhance the connection with employment after the graduation when they understand the characteristics of auxiliary devices and equipment before entering workplaces. Meanwhile, the students being cultivated the design capability could improve and innovate tools, as the improvement of auxiliary devices and the practical design of innovative products and the functions from a professional engineer are close to the users' demands. In this study, the Delphi method, a group decision-making technique, and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) multiattribute decision-making function was adopted to establish a decision-making model for designing multifunctional products for assessing the students of Industrial Design in learning effectiveness in innovative engineering product design and development. In addition, a practical multifunctional product-design case was investigated to demonstrate the application of the model. This study found that integrating interdisciplinary courses and instruction by industry professionals and introducing industry-academia cooperation had a considerable influence on interdisciplinary teaching and learning.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore how undergraduate college students formed partnerships in informal educational teams to design and build an interdisciplinary, ill-defined, integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) project and translate it to lessons taught to a pre-collegiate student (e.g., K-12 in the US) audience. The authors pursued two research questions: (a) How does an authentic research project provide space for integrating STEM disciplines? (b) How does an authentic research project impact partnerships among team members? Nine undergraduate college students were accepted into the 2020 cohort, forming three teams of three undergraduates each. Teams were roughly composed of one engineering major, one science major, and one education major. Methods of data collection included interviews and field notes. Data were analyzed by assessing the level of partnership achieved based on an already established model. Results indicate that all teams progressed through pre-partnership to at least the partnership (little p) level. Two partnership dimensions achieved the highest (big P) level: one of perception of benefit and one of products and activities. The results have implications that integration of STEM disciplines and forming partnerships could be related, and that building teamwork skills results in products of higher quality. The results are linked to previous research and recommendations for more effective partnerships are provided.

AB  - Due to a lack of science instruction and a need to serve an increasing number of students identifying as Emerging Bilingual, one school district in Oregon sought to develop a new method of integrating science and language instruction. In the model, all teachers taught science with embedded language instruction, three to four days a week, to every K-5 student, during a specific, dedicated time of the school day. This initiative sought to build science content knowledge and language proficiency simultaneously through science investigations that put language as the integral component to learning. The research was designed in collaboration with a local university as part of a long-term research-practice partnership with the goal to understand, refine, and repeat the initiative using a reflective, triangulated case study approach. The partnership utilized three rounds of teacher surveys, teacher interviews, and quantitative analyses of student science standardized test scores to understand how science investigations could build science content knowledge and language proficiency simultaneously. Results showed that the innovative initiative increased the quantity of science teaching in the district, may have increased students' science knowledge, but results also showed that improvements to the model are needed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the role that a collaborative teaching approach, referred to as a community of practice (CoP), had on a team of four second grade teachers' implementation of a science-based interdisciplinary curriculum. Data was collected in the form of extensive observation notes gathered over 10-weeks of twice weekly team meetings and two 45 minute interviews with each participant. From the field notes developed two vignettes for the purpose of illustrating the members CoP in action. Combining my analysis of the vignettes and the interviews resulted in three emergent themes: 1) benefits, 2) contributions, and 3) their commitment to professional development. From this study I learned that establishing a CoP was viewed as a necessary component of the team's implementation of their science-based interdisciplinary curriculum. Implications for encouraging preservice and inservice elementary teachers to develop CoPs to support science teaching, specifically interdisciplinary teaching, are discussed.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a fundamental skill and an analytical ability that children in the twenty-first century should develop. Students should begin to work with algorithmic problem-solving and computational methods in K-12. Drawing on a conceptual framework (IGGIA) that combines CT and problem-solving, this study designed and implemented an interdisciplinary Scratch course in a primary school, examined the impact of the new problem-solving instructional approach (the adapted IGGIA) on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy, and explored the gender differences in these two aspects. A pretest-posttest nonequivalent group design was conducted among 63 fifth-grade students in two computer science classes over 14 weeks. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected through the administration of CT scales, Scratch artifacts analysis and focus group interviews. The results revealed that the adapted IGGIA: (1) significantly improved the CT skills of primary school students; (2) had a significant positive impact on pupils' CT self-efficacy, especially on their critical thinking, algorithmic thinking and problem-solving; and (3) significantly enhanced girls' CT skills and self-efficacy. These findings indicated that problem-solving instructional approaches could promote both cognitive and noncognitive aspects of students' deeper computational learning.

AB  - This research aimed to explore the effect of problem-based STEM activities on middle school students' perceptions related to problem-solving skills and their critical thinking tendencies. The sample consisted of 81 students. A mixed method was employed in the research. The quantitative data collection tools were the "Critical Thinking Tendency Scale" and "The Perception Scale for Problem Solving Skill." The qualitative tools were a Semi-structured Interview Form and Experience diaries developed by the researcher considering the quantitative scales. While the quantitative data, obtained in the research, were analyzed with one-way ANOVA, the statistical method; and the qualitative data were analyzed with the content analysis. At the end of the research, a significant difference was detected in favor of experimental groups in the students' perceptions of their problem-solving skills and critical thinking tendencies. On the other hand, in the qualitative results, it was reported that the problem-based STEM education created a positive effect as cognitive maturity and innovativeness in the students' feelings, thought, and behaviors. It was concluded that the students used the inter-disciplinary knowledge with the problem-based STEM activities; found the problem solving, understanding the problem and working with their friends favorably. According to these results, it can be claimed that STEM education is highly effective in developing the skills that are expected from individuals in the 21st century such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and social interaction.

AB  - Although Error Analysis (EA) has been broadly used in Foreign Language and Mother Tongue learning contexts, it has not been applied in the field of engineering and by STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) students in a systematic way. In this interdisciplinary pilot study, we applied the EA methodology to a wide corpus of exercises and essays written by third-year students of mechanical engineering, with the main purpose of achieving a precise diagnosis of the students' strengths and weaknesses in writing skills. For the analysis to be as exhaustive as possible, the errors were typologized into three main categories (linguistic, mathematical, and rhetorical-organizational), each of which is, in turn, subdivided into 15 items. The results show that the predominant errors are rhetorical-organizational (39%) and linguistic (38%). The application of EA permits the precise identification of the areas of improvement and the subsequent implementation of an educational design that allows STEM students to improve their communicative strategies, especially those related to the writing skills and, more precisely, those having to do with the optimal use of syntax, punctuation, rhetorical structure of the text, and mathematical coherence.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of the research was to examine if adolescents can develop abilities of democratic interaction through Community Theatre. Design/methodology: Firstly, two instruments were applied, a questionnaire covering socio-moral problems, of the students and a Questionnaire, covering the Educational Ideologies of the professors. Then, a theatrical intervention was realized at middle-school students in Aguascalientes City, based on the objectives of the formation of Citizenship as stated at the National Curriculum. Findings: Students themselves stated a change in their attitude during the intervention, which was also observed and registered at the field diary and at the written evaluations. For this reason, we claim that Community theater could be used as a transdisciplinary method for teaching democratic skills, as it creates a public sphere where the students can develop democratic behavior. Research limitations: Further studies on the subject are required, especially concerning the time and the sample as the research had a two-month duration and was conducted at a limited population. Practical implications: The contribution of this project was the introduction of Community Theatre at the service of the Citizenship Education, promoting the artistic education as a means of the formal education in the search for personal and social democratic development and could be considered in an educational reform.

AB  - Catholic colleges and universities traditionally are grounded in liberal arts education, yet many Catholic institutions also educate future scientists and engineers. We propose that a distinctively Catholic science and engineering education should include an emphasis on Catholic concepts of the common good and social justice, liberal arts education that enriches and informs science and engineering practice and vice versa, and commitment to service. Moreover, we propose that Catholic colleges consider implementing curricular changes designed to bring the humanistic and technical disciplines into closer alignment. New curricula could include a capstone undergraduate course that draws on interdisciplinary faculty with the goal of giving science and engineering students the tools needed to be ethical practitioners in a frequently unethical world. Such a course would also provide humanists with a better understanding of the technological world in which we all live, enabling graduates to make well-informed decisions throughout their lives.

AB  - Students in computer science and information technology should be engaged in solving real-world problems received from government and industry as well as those that expose them to various areas of application. In this paper, we discuss interdisciplinary project experiences between majors and non-majors that offered a creative and innovative opportunity for collaborative learning. Active-learning exercises allowed students to express their creativity and apply concepts learned from each discipline. Feedback from this effort resulted in the development of the Seven C's (Competencies) for collaborative learning that were ascertained for successful completion of an interdisciplinary project. We feel that these interdisciplinary and collaborative efforts increased student appreciation, enhanced team skills, and created a positive learning environment for the application of concepts.

AB  - During the last years, there has been a growing multidisciplinary interest in alternative educational approaches, such as serious games, aiming at enhancing thinking skills and media literacy. Likewise, the objective of this study is to present the design and the development of an educational web application for learning the necessary steps towards the detection of bogus content, according to the fact-checking procedures. The game presents news articles, which have to be characterized as fake or real by the players. During the effort to reach the correct decision, the players can use tools and practices for identifying relevant information regarding the clues, which frame a news story (title, date, creator, source, containing images). After presenting the progress of interface design and development, this paper reports the results of a randomized online field study (n = 111), which provides some preliminary evidence. Specifically, it is validated that the game can raise awareness, teach about authentication tools, and highlight the importance of patterns that include evidence regarding the authenticity of articles. Additionally, thorough discussion was conducted within a media class (n = 35) to receive useful feedback/evaluation about the offered utilities and their usability. The findings suggest that educational games may be a promising vehicle to inoculate the public against misinformation.

AB  - Introductory courses in biology often lack sufficient emphasis on quantitative skills and interdisciplinary problem solving, leaving many students unprepared for more advanced biology coursework and hampering their ability to pursue biology research careers. MathBench Biology Modules were created to enhance the quantitative skills of biology students by leveraging the unique advantages of the online environment (e.g., self-pacing, opportunities for practice, and immediate, individualized feedback). Using a pre-/post-design, we tested the ability of MathBench modules to improve student quantitative skills and their attitudes towards the integration of math and biology in a community college introductory biology course, where instructors face multiple challenges to integrating quantitative content. Ten sections of the course incorporated MathBench into laboratory and lecture content (MathBench group, N = 124 students), while five sections covered the same laboratory and lecture content without MathBench (comparison group, N = 31 students). On average, students who used MathBench experienced gains in their quantitative skills, while those in the comparison group did not. For students with the lowest level of preparation in math, using MathBench was associated with improvements in quantitative skill only if they were concurrently enrolled in a math class. Neither group of students demonstrated changes over the semester in their attitudes towards the integration of math and biology. Qualitative data indicated that MathBench group students could identify multiple aspects of how MathBench contributed to their learning, including providing new content, alternative approaches to learning, and additional opportunities to practice new skills. Our work demonstrates how learner-centered technologies can be used effectively to supplement traditional instruction in the community college context.

AB  - Writing has an important role in science education and practice. Emphasizing the interdisciplinary collaboration between English rhetoric studies and biology, seemingly disparate disciplines, we describe a model for a scientific writing and communication course. The goals of the course were to prepare students for science-oriented careers, as well as for professional and graduate schools, by teaching the various conventions of science communication and writing. Toward these aims we assigned a research proposal, the major assignment of the course, patterned after the National Science Foundation's Graduate Student Research Fellowship application. For this assignment we encouraged students to research topics in their preferred fields. They continued engaging their chosen topics of interest through other innovative assignments, which spanned multiple communication genres: a rhetorical analysis, a popular science article, a science poster analysis, and other related projects. We incorporated a peer-review element into each assignment to emphasize revision and collaborative learning. The students acknowledged our collaboration and the course as beneficial to their academic and future professional careers.

AB  - This narrative of my research on drawing shares my experience of relearning drawing by hand and how the act of drawing can stimulate curiosity. This article examines its potential to enhance learning/observation in science. It describes a kinaesthetic drawing methodology and addresses pedagogical solutions for overcoming a student's declaration that "I can't draw". This art creation experience was an interdisciplinary study in the faculties of art, science and education. My claim is that a hands-on, interactive approach to learning is at play where strategies of creating images are not predetermined. What emerges is both a subjective and objective phenomenon. As knowledge production arises after the fact of drawing, an emergent process allows for reflexive methodology and intuition to come into play. As Derrida describes in "Memoirs of the Blind", drawing emerges from the temporal space between the seeing and the unfolding of the drawing. This art-based research flows in the direction of reflective practice-based research through drawing, to address these questions by calling on the tactile and kinaesthetic dimensions of sense that drawing can engender.

AB  - Extreme variations in the earth's climate have radically changed the ecosystems, economics, cultural practices, language, and lifeways of the Chamorro and Carolinian peoples who live in the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands in the Western North Pacific. It is essential that the upcoming generation gain science understandings that incorporate indigenous knowledge and applied problem solving, in order to help address the adverse climate effects. This paper examines the deliberations of a Local Professional Learning Community--a multidisciplinary group of cultural practitioners, elders, youth, scientists and educators--formed to identify, articulate, and share a set of design principles to guide the integration of indigenous knowledge and climate education practices in the CNMI, and focus future research in this urgent climate domain.

AB  - For the purpose of introducing the trends and development of science teacher education in Taiwan, three stages of teacher education were explored in this study: the distant past (DP)--1949 to 1994; the immediate past (IP):1994 to 2017; and the present and future (PF): 2018 and beyond. Each of the three stages has had a different emphasis on science teacher education. In the DP stage, science teacher education in Taiwan focused mainly on preparing elementary and secondary school science teachers with sufficient science knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge and to be good role models in the classroom. During the IP stage, the "Teacher Education Act" [TEA] was enacted in 1994, and the teacher education system in Taiwan changed from a centralized system to a decentralized one. Multiple channels were opened for teacher preparation. In this period of time, the purpose of science teacher education shifted from providing good role models and sufficient science knowledge to developing competency-based professional science teachers. All teacher education programs in Taiwan could offer science teacher education training courses for pre-service science teachers. In addition, the teaching internship duration was reduced from 1 year to one semester. Teacher certification became a dominant focus in each county or school. During the PF stage, an amended TEA was implemented in 2017, and 12-year continued curriculum standards were officially implemented in the public school system in 2019. The 12-year continued curriculum standards address inquiry, practices and cross-discipline instruction. Science teachers need not only to teach science content knowledge, but also to integrate content knowledge, inquiry competence and other discipline areas into their teaching. The demand for good science teachers is increasing. Meanwhile, the low recruitment rate for science teachers impedes the public's willingness to enroll in teacher education programs. Few teachers with bachelor degrees can pass the teacher certification exam necessary to be hired in teaching positions. Although the conditions for pre-service science teachers are harsh, there is demand in our teacher education system to recruit science teachers with talent and passion.

AB  - This article describes how it is due to the fact that computer science is present in many activities of daily life, students need to develop skills to solve problems to improve the lives of people in general. This article investigates correlations between teachers' motivational orientations, beliefs and practices with respect to the application of real-world problems in undergraduate courses. A questionnaire was applied to twenty-eight teachers of an undergraduate computer science course. Data from the questionnaire was analyzed using statistical methods. The results show that the majority of the teachers, especially those who interact with companies, believe that the insertion of real-world problems in the classroom is important. However, some teachers are not willing to adopt this practice. This is linked to reasons such as the need for more flexible curricula and a better teaching qualification with respect to collaborative problem solving.

AB  - Biochemistry and molecular biology education starts before our students get to university. From a very early age, they start learning informally about science beginning with the basics of science and as they progress through their school years they should be exposed to more advanced topics such as biochemistry and molecular biology. This session at the conference focused on three very different examples of engaging school students with biochemistry and molecular biology.

AB  - The relevance of the research is due to additional opportunities to improve the quality of teaching mathematics in a digital school, support professional orientation and self-determination of young people through the inclusion of mobile services and platforms in mathematical activities. The research problem is determined by the following contradictions: 1) between the capabilities of modern digital technologies in terms of improving the quality of mathematical training, the formation of universal skills required by the economy of the future, and the model implemented by educational institutions; 2) between the need to provide resources for solving problems of a socio-economic nature in the conditions of the fourth industrial revolution and the insufficient level of mathematical literacy of graduates. The purpose of this research is to study the didactic potential of mobile technologies to support mathematical education in a digital school while preparing specialists of the future. Moreover, the research offers a methodological approach to organize project activities of developing applications in terms of increasing the effectiveness of teaching mathematics and vocational guidance. The article clarifies the concepts "mathematical thinking", "mathematical literacy" for a digital school and describes the didactic principles of incorporating mobile resources into the educational space which increase the efficiency of training engineers of the future, support vocational guidance and self-determination. The author offers methodological methods and recommendations for organizing creative interdisciplinary project activities in order to develop mobile applications that contribute to the formation of qualities and skills forming the basis of mathematical thinking. The materials of the article can be used: firstly, to ensure the personalization of mathematical training in the course of creative, interdisciplinary, cognitive research activities of students while developing mobile applications, social integration and vocational guidance; secondly, to change the concept of mathematical education at school; thirdly, to improve the implemented model of education based on the traditional trajectory "preschool education-school-university-additional education" in the context of the new requirements of business, society, and the state for the training of highly qualified professionals in the professions of the future.

AB  - The automated water filtration design challenge integrates computer programming and basic electronics concepts through the SIMILAR systems engineering design process. The SIMILAR systems design process is to state the problem, investigate alternatives, model the system, integrate the system, launch the system, assess performance, and reevaluate (SIMILAR). The modeling, integration, and launching steps of the design process require specific skill sets related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) concepts. These concepts are significant when addressing the various national standards related to "Standards for Technological Literacy" ("STL"), "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS"), Common Core State Standards (CCSS), and The K-12 Computer Science Framework. The integration of these concepts reinforces how they can be utilized together to increase the understanding of systems and systems design. This article describes how an automated water filtration design challenge can be used as an interdisciplinary approach to solve a real-world problem while addressing various national standards and frameworks.

AB  - While a mutually agreed-upon definition of STEM education remains elusive, there is no doubt that instructional models and ideas put forward with the STEM label have had a tremendous impact on thinking, debate, and practice in schools worldwide. At issue is the degree to which some or all the STEM disciplines must be taught in a concurrent or combined way, so curricula can qualify for the STEM education label. In this manuscript, we unpack the various perspectives of STEM that have evolved recently and propose the acronym I-STEM for any integrated instructional blending of the individual STEM elements. We examine some problematic issues related to what seems a premature acceptance of I-STEM and conclude with some suggestions for the science education community relative to the emergence of STEM. This article is written from the perspective of improving the teaching and learning of science, and if I-STEM can be shown to further advance that aim, it would be foolish not to embrace it. However, if I-STEM is being promoted on the tenuous empirical and philosophical foundation we see presently, we must slow down. We must ensure that we really want this revolution in science education to succeed. We worry that science content and process learning opportunities might too easily be lost in a rush to teach STEM in a manner that gives substantial instructional time and energy to all of the disciplines regardless of the context of the classroom in which it is taught.

AB  - The article explains how to use a project-based method as an effective means of interdisciplinary interaction when teaching a foreign language on the example of The Institute of service, tourism and design (branch) of the North Caucasus Federal University (Pyatigorsk, Stavropol Territory Russia). The article holds the main objectives of the project-based method, forming their classification. The authors point out the need to conduct pre-project work by mindfully selecting the appropriate linguistic material, developing a definite system of tasks and exercises. Another important step is the selection of general or profile topics that could be of interest to students in terms of their future profession. In addition, the article describes several out-of-class projects as well as it provides basic requirements for using the project-based method while teaching a foreign language.

AB  - Recent calls in biology education research (BER) have recommended that researchers leverage learning theories and methodologies from other disciplines to investigate the mechanisms by which students to develop sophisticated ideas. We suggest "design-based research" from the learning sciences is a compelling methodology for achieving this aim. Design-based research investigates the "learning ecologies" that move student thinking toward mastery. These "learning ecologies" are grounded in theories of learning, produce measurable changes in student learning, generate design principles that guide the development of instructional tools, and are enacted using extended, iterative teaching experiments. In this essay, we introduce readers to the key elements of design-based research, using our own research into student learning in undergraduate physiology as an example of design-based research in BER. Then, we discuss how design-based research can extend work already done in BER and foster interdisciplinary collaborations among cognitive and learning scientists, biology education researchers, and instructors. We also explore some of the challenges associated with this methodological approach.

AB  - In 2006 Jeanette Wing, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, proposed computational thinking (CT) as a literacy just as important as reading, writing, and mathematics. Wing defined CT as a set of skills and strategies computer scientists use to solve complex, computational problems (Wing 2006). The computer science and education research communities, along with the authors of the "Next Generation Science Standards" (NGSS Lead States 2013; see box, p. 28), agree that CT is essential for students' successful participation in today's economy To help teachers incorporate CT into their classrooms, David Weintrop and his colleagues (2016) proposed the Computational Thinking in Mathematics and Science Taxonomy (Figure 1). In an effort to move CT beyond the computer lab and into the mathematics and science classrooms, their framework proposes 22 CT practices divided into four categories. This article describes a project that incorporates many of the practices outlined in their broad view of computational thinking. The Boom. Bust. Build. project employs a project-based learning (PBL) approach (Krajcik and Blumenfeld 2006) to teach computational thinking and NGSS-aligned environmental science concepts through redevelopment of a fictional city. The project is student-centered, collaborative, authentic, includes student choice and autonomy, and could be made interdisciplinary through collaboration with civics and economics classes (Knoll 1997). Furthermore, teachers serve as facilitators and guides rather than driving the process.

AB  - Motivational hands-on workshops for grade-school level future scientists are needed to inspire young and receptive minds. Described here is an educational event, titled "Inspiring Future Rocket Chemists", with hands-on laboratory exercises demonstrating the fundamentals of rocket flight and live chemistry demonstrations illustrating the fundamentals of rocket propulsion. This event was developed for seventh and eighth grade students by the local Mojave Desert Section of the American Chemical Society and the China Lake Museum Foundation (CLMF).The CLMF is dedicated to educating the public and preserving the history of the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division's contributions to our nation's warfighters. The workshop was developed and led by experts currently working in or retired from the rocket science field. Four hands-on exercises and four demonstrations were performed with the students. The laboratory exercises and demonstrations covered topics including model rocket components and assembly, rocket stability, propulsion, safety, chemical reactions, gas generation, and catalysis in propellants. Two distinguishing characteristics of this event was the inclusion of fundamental principles of rocket science and emphasis on the interdisciplinary nature of the field. The event's pedagogical goals were to motivate and inspire the participants in exploring the field of rocketry while teaching them the fundamental properties and important safety precautions for practicing rocketry. This event serves as the framework for future collaborative efforts between institutions for specialized workshops in topic areas not traditionally covered in student's coursework. The effectiveness of the event was measured through student assessments and feedback at the conclusion of the event.

AB  - Team projects are a way to expose students to conflicting project objectives, and "[t]here should be a strong real-world element...to ensure that the experience is realistic" [ACM/IEEE-CS 2015b]. Team projects provide an opportunity for students to put their education into practice and prepare them for their professional careers. The aim of this special issue, and the previous one, is to collect and share evidence about the state of practice of team projects in computing education and to help educators in designing and running team projects. The articles presented in the present issue cover the following topics: real projects for real clients, open source projects, multidisciplinary team projects, student and team assessment, and cognitive and psychological aspects of team projects.

AB  - Whilst adaptive experts have well-researched beliefs and attitudes towards learning, what is unclear are the interactions that occur within the learning environment that constitute their learning experiences. The practice of geriatric medicine emphasises the interdisciplinary care of complex frail older adults. Our study sets out to understand the learning experiences of adaptive experts in geriatric medicine by examining how interactions at the intra-personal, inter-personal and organisational levels contributed to the development of adaptive expertise. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study through semi-structured interviews of 16 geriatricians experts from a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Data were analyzed via reflexive thematic analysis. The core essence of the learning experiences was described as a journey of 'knowing when we do not know', which was characterised by three themes: (i) Anchoring ethos of person-centric care where the experts drew upon their values to develop a holistic view of the patient beyond the medical domain, (ii) Enabling stance of being curious where their curiosity and openness to learning was nurtured through the practice of reflection, and with the benefit of time as a commodity and for development of expertise, and (iii) Scaffolding organisational culture of inquiry where an environment that is supportive of learning is built on the culture of psychological safety and the culture of mentoring. Taken together, our study highlighted the importance of interactions at the intra-personal, inter-personal and organisational levels in the learning experiences of adaptive experts.

AB  - College students with identities traditionally marginalized in scientific disciplines are more engaged and more likely to remain in science if they feel that they belong in their science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classes and departments. In this qualitative case study, we elevated marginalized student voices to learn how departmental experiences shaped their sense of belonging in curricular and co-curricular spaces. Our research team interviewed 27 undergraduate life science students at a large predominantly white, research-intensive university. Participants reflected on their lived experiences and feelings of belonging within a biology department and shared their perceptions of departmental efforts related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Three themes emerged as being of value to undergraduate students while they navigated the sciences: (1) implementing inclusive pedagogies, (2) providing co-curricular resources and support, and (3) humanizing life sciences education. These stories illuminated the importance of authenticity and intentionality in the implementation of strategies related to these three themes. This study provides an example of the power of centering marginalized students' lived experiences to identify strategies that can be employed more broadly to improve our courses, our departmental cultures, and our institutional policies--strategies essential to supporting students with a diversity of identities in engaging, belonging, and persisting in STEM.

AB  - Despite efforts to integrate science and mathematics learning in elementary school through carefully designed activities, students' cognitive processes remain relatively untapped as a possible place of intersection. We believe "reasoning" is a productive co-curricular concept that could lead to meaningful integration. We conducted a systematic literature review of empirical research published over the past 20 years on students' reasoning in both science education and mathematics education. Articles were summarized and examined for their: (1) methodological approach and experimental design; (2) social dimension in the classroom; (3) definition of reasoning and associated structures; and (4) evidence of students' engagement in reasoning. For each theme, relationships between scientific and mathematical reasoning research were examined for the purposes of finding intersections and discrepancies between the two subject areas. As a result, we suggest the term "STEM reasoning" that embodies the core skills and thought processes across both subject areas to provide an authentic approach to integrating elementary school science and mathematics learning.

AB  - Making and tinkering is currently gaining traction as an interdisciplinary approach to education. However, little is known about how these activities and explorations in formal and informal learning spaces address the content and skills common to professionals across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. As such, the purpose of this qualitative study was to examine how youth were engaged in the eight science and engineering practices outlined within the US Next Generation Science Standards within an informal learning environment utilizing principles of tinkering within the daily activities. Findings highlight how youth and facilitators engaged and enacted in practices common to scientists and engineers. Yet, in this study, enactment of these practices "looked" differently than might be expected in a formal learning environment such as a laboratory setting. For example, in this setting, students were observed carrying out trials on their design as opposed to carrying out a formal scientific investigation. Results also highlight instances of doing science and engineering not explicitly stated within parameters of formal education documents in the USA, such as experiences with failure.

AB  - Interdisciplinary undergraduate research experiences often require students to work in teams with other students and researchers from different disciplines, creating a need for development of new skills in interdisciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we describe our unique efforts to mentor participants in developing these skills during our team-based research experience for undergraduates program. This effort was initiated in response to a perceived need to provide professional development in collaboration for our participants, who come from diverse backgrounds that span a range of disciplines, institutions, and cultures. We describe here the intervention used, which is a modified version of one successfully implemented in a classroom setting. Furthermore, we present our formative and summative program evaluation data regarding participants' perceptions about what helps or hinders team science. The most-repeated themes in student evaluations, in order from most mentions to least, were: communication, goal setting, shared mental model, timing/scheduling, cooperation, non-participation, attitudes, and mentor guidance/support. Together these themes account for 82% of the student responses. Lastly, we present our observations of the positive effects of this intervention on our program. Our findings may be useful to those mentoring undergraduates in both team research and classroom group learning.

AB  - One of the aims of education is to produce wise and responsible citizens who are aware of their impact on the environment and can address and solve daily life problems. From this point of view, science education leading to science literacy is helpful for all students, regardless of their future careers. In this paper, we first review the definitions of science literacy in the literature and present the strategies for its development. In Slovenia, we refer to the ongoing national project NA-MA POTI. Most of the strategies studied focus on primary and secondary schools. However, for the development of science literacy in primary and secondary education, teachers themselves must achieve a sufficient level of science literacy. The research was conducted with a small group of prospective teachers, focusing on three components of science literacy: asking research questions, making hypotheses, and designing an experiment. In addition, we analysed the curricula of the science didactics courses in the teacher education program. The findings show a great need for a systematic change in the curricula. Finally, proposals and ideas for improving the curricula for the didactics of science and the syllabus of the Subject teacher study program are presented.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to present a conceptual framework that integrates science and language learning for all students, including English learners (ELs). This framework is grounded in the mutually supportive nature of science instructional shifts, spurred by "A Framework for K-12 Science Education" (National Research Council, 2012. A framework for K-12 science education: Practices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas) and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), and language instructional shifts, informed by contemporary thinking in second language acquisition. First, we describe the conceptual framework that consists of our perspective and design principles. Then, we describe one approach for using the conceptual framework to develop NGSS-aligned instructional materials that promote science and language learning with elementary students, including ELs. Finally, we offer implications for future research for our own design research specifically and for the field more broadly. The conceptual framework highlights how substantive collaboration between content areas, such as science, and the field of EL education can help ensure that all students, and ELs in particular, are supported in meeting rigorous content standards while developing proficiency in English.

AB  - Is there a crisis in Australian science and mathematics education? Declining enrolments in upper secondary Science and Mathematics courses have gained much attention from the media, politicians and high-profile scientists over the last few years, yet there is no consensus amongst stakeholders about either the nature or the magnitude of the changes. We have collected raw enrolment data from the education departments of each of the Australian states and territories from 1992 to 2012 and analysed the trends for Biology, Chemistry, Physics, two composite subject groups (Earth Sciences and Multidisciplinary Sciences), as well as entry, intermediate and advanced Mathematics. The results of these analyses are discussed in terms of participation rates, raw enrolments and gender balance. We have found that the total number of students in Year 12 increased by around 16% from 1992 to 2012 while the participation rates for most Science and Mathematics subjects, as a proportion of the total Year 12 cohort, fell (Biology (-10%), Chemistry (-5%), Physics (-7%), Multidisciplinary Science (-5%), intermediate Mathematics (-11%), advanced Mathematics (-7%) in the same period. There were increased participation rates in Earth Sciences (+0.3%) and entry Mathematics (+11%). In each case the greatest rates of change occurred prior to 2001 and have been slower and steadier since. We propose that the broadening of curriculum offerings, further driven by students' self-perception of ability and perceptions of subject difficulty and usefulness, are the most likely cause of the changes in participation. While these continuing declines may not amount to a crisis, there is undoubtedly serious cause for concern.

AB  - This essay analyzes and develops recent views about explanation in biology. Philosophers of biology have parted with the received deductive-nomological model of scientific explanation primarily by attempting to capture actual biological theorizing and practice. This includes an endorsement of different kinds of explanation (e.g., mathematical and causal-mechanistic), a joint study of discovery and explanation, and an abandonment of models of theory reduction in favor of accounts of explanatory reduction. Of particular current interest are philosophical accounts of complex explanations that appeal to different levels of organismal organization and use contributions from different biological disciplines. The essay lays out one model that views explanatory integration across different disciplines as being structured by scientific problems. I emphasize the philosophical need to take the explanatory aims pursued by different groups of scientists into account, as explanatory aims determine whether different explanations are competing or complementary and govern the dynamics of scientific practice, including interdisciplinary research. I distinguish different kinds of pluralism that philosophers have endorsed in the context of explanation in biology, and draw several implications for science education, especially the need to teach science as an interdisciplinary and dynamic practice guided by scientific problems and explanatory aims.

AB  - The National Science Education Standards have highlighted the importance of active learning and reflection for contemporary scientific methods in K-12 classrooms, including the use of models. Computer modeling and visualization are tools that researchers employ in their scientific inquiry process, and often computer models are used in collaborative projects across disciplines. The goal of this project was to develop and field-test a module that used a computer model to teach marine sciences content in an applied, inquiry-based, and collaborative manner. Students used an estuarine transport model to explore the question of how circulation patterns affect planktonic organisms, demonstrating the interdisciplinary interaction of physics and biology. Our experience suggests that computer models, when used for inquiry, can help foster students' understanding of the nature of science and critical-thinking skills.

AB  - Aviation is an interdisciplinary subject that has influenced human development over the last century. Learning about aviation exposes students to principles of flight, language, earth science, aeronautical engineering, flight training and airmanship. In K-12 education, educators have started to encourage children to learn science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects via aviation-themed activities to develop future scientists and engineers. This study investigated upper primary students' motivations to learn STEM via engaging in flight simulation experiences. The sample consisted of 345 10- to 13-year-old Hong Kong students from 8 primary schools. A modified version of the 31-item Science Motivation Questionnaire II (SMQ II) with four subscales with a focus on aviation was used. The relationships between intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, self-efficacy and peer support across gender and performance were examined. The data obtained were analysed using factor analysis and a regression model. According to our model, students are most strongly motivated by peer support, followed by intrinsic motivation, and they are least motivated by self-efficacy. As expected, our results indicate that a gender gap exists in aviation-themed STEM learning. These findings can help educators to better understand students' perceptions of aviation science and further develop related learning activities.

AB  - This study assessed the impact of science teaching laboratories designed with visual connections to spaces outside the laboratory, either to interior spaces or to the outdoors. Specifically, we assessed (1) student perceptions of interdisciplinarity, (2) the ability to stay focused, and (3) the environment for student learning. Student surveys were administered in 2008 in St. Olaf College's old Science Center (windowless teaching laboratories) and in 2009 in St. Olaf College's new Regents Hall of Natural and Mathematical Sciences (same time of year, same courses). Our results indicate that students in Regents Hall have a better appreciation of what happens in science labs in disciplines outside of their major, are more satisfied with the number of windows, have a greater sense of connection with the outside world, like coming to the laboratory more, are better able to stay focused, and are less anxious to leave the laboratory at the end of the lab session. However, we found no difference in the extent to which activities outside the laboratory interfered with student's ability to focus on their work. We therefore recommend visual connectedness within teaching laboratories as a useful strategy for those considering new or renovated science facilities. (Contains 3 tables and 3 figures.)

AB  - The study aimed to investigate the effects of visual art supported inquiry based science education on 5th grade students' scientific process skills (SPS). In the research, one group pretest-posttest experimental design is used. The study was carried out with the help of 20 5th grade students. For the purpose of the research, an education including inquiry based activities (IBA) and visual art based activities (VABA) was designed and applied. The education applied during this study contains 7 IBAs, 5 VABAs. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected during this implementation. While the quantitative data was gathered by SPS Test, the qualitative data was gathered by unstructured observations. For analyzing the data gathered by SPS Test, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was used. For analyzing the unstructured observation data, content analysis was used. Based on the data gathered from the study, it can be said that visual art supported inquiry based science education contributes to improve students' observation, inference, determining variables and designing experiment skills, while it contributes limitedly to improve comparison-classification, prediction, estimation, measuring, collecting knowledge and data, data processing and forming a model and interpreting data skills. It does not, however, contribute to improve recognizing and using experiment materials and instruments, recording data and presentation skills.

AB  - Today's college-aged students are graduating into a world that relies on multidisciplinary talents to succeed. Engineering college majors are more likely to find jobs after college that are outside of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, including jobs in healthcare, management, and social services. A survey of engineering undergraduate students at the University of Colorado Boulder in November 2012 indicated a desire by students to simultaneously pursue secondary teacher licensure alongside their engineering degrees: 25 percent "agreed" or "strongly agreed" that they would be interested in earning grades 7-12 science or math teaching licenses while [they] earn [their] engineering degrees. As colleges of engineering education, how can we support the success of our students in these multidisciplinary fields post-graduation, including teaching? The University of Colorado Boulder's College of Engineering and Applied Science in partnership with the School of Education, has developed an innovative program that results in graduates attaining a secondary school STEM teacher license concurrently with an engineering BS degree. This streamlined pathway through engineering educates and prepares a workforce of secondary teachers capable of high-level teaching in multiple STEM subjects--either engineering coupled with science (biology, chemistry, and physics), or engineering coupled with mathematics. These engineers are motivated and inspired to pursue two career routes because they find value and passion for both professions. One study showed that successful mathematics and science teachers "would have liked to be engineers." Teachers expressed that being comfortable and understanding engineering phenomena is a barrier to why they initially did not pursue an engineering career. We are fostering students that develop both an engineering mindset alongside a commitment to giving back through secondary teaching in this program. This research aims to discover if and how students in the engineering + teaching program identify themselves as both an engineering student and as a teaching student. We are exploring why students decided to pursue engineering and teaching and how they plan to use engineering, teaching, or both in their futures. It is important to also understand how we attract students to this program. Given the diverse student experience inherent in this degree program built around passion and desire to combine engineering and teaching, the paper addresses the questions, "How do engineering knowledge and teaching knowledge intersect for undergraduate engineering students?" and "What challenges exist to navigating an engineering major with a teaching license pathway?" Initial survey and focus group data collected this past academic year indicates that students in this degree program identify as both an engineer and a teacher. Using mixed-methods analysis informed by current education research--including quantitative and qualitative survey questions and small focus groups--we explore the ways in which students discovered this program and how they plan to incorporate the two disciplines in their future. We are interested in how engineering students will incorporate the knowledge that they learned in engineering classes into the lesson plans they design for secondary classroom students.

AB  - Much has been written and debated on the importance of including moral, character or values education in school curricula. In line with this, teachers' views with regard to values education have often been sought. However, a search into the literature on values in science education has revealed little on this domain. In an attempt to close this gap, this study explored the views of teachers with regard to values infusion in the teaching of science. The aim was to investigate teachers' perceptions on two broad areas: (i) how values were infused or addressed in lower secondary science and (ii) how values-infused science lessons influenced their students' dispositions and actions. The participants who took part in the interviews were lower secondary science teachers teaching Grade 8 in selected Singapore and New Delhi schools. The findings showed that values inherent in the discipline of science, such as validity, fairness, honesty, rigour, predominated in the lessons conducted by the teachers in both contexts. Furthermore, in Singapore, equal numbers of teachers made references to values upheld and practised by scientists and values arising from the interplay between people and scientific processes and products. In New Delhi however, the emphasis was higher on the latter category of values than on the former. Generally, in both contexts, values infusion in science lessons was not planned but occurred spontaneously as values issues surfaced in class. Teachers in both Singapore and New Delhi used strategies such as questioning, discussion, activities and direct instructions to carry out values infusion, although they experienced challenges that included content and time constraints, lack of student readiness and of teacher competency. Nevertheless, the teachers interviewed perceived that values in science lessons brought about changes in students' personal attributes, affect and behaviour, such as greater interest and prosocial engagement.

AB  - Traditional Knowledge (TK) is a qualitative and quantitative living body of knowledge developed locally and regionally across generations over thousands of years. This study aims to show through authentic voice the importance of centering TK systems and cultural needs to provide equitable geoscience education programs. TK can be communicated through a variety of methods, such as story and song, dance, paintings, carvings, structures, and textiles. TK is interdisciplinary within anthropological and ecological subsistence and provide enhanced cultural and spiritual context. Research findings are enhanced by the exploratory and inquiry-based design of TK and provide insight into the anthropogenic impacts on the environment allowing researchers to gain a rich understanding of human behaviors and patterns when collecting and analyzing data. This study examines factors influencing Indigenous students' participation and retention in the geosciences, specifically gauging opinions on the incorporation of TK systems into geoscience education. Data was collected using an electronic survey to identify factors that inform students' decision to enter geoscience disciplines and better understand the importance of role models and mentors for retention. Our findings indicate that Indigenous students were interested in using both TK and Western science in geoscience learning spaces, Indigenous role models played an important role in sense of belonging and identity in the geosciences, and the incorporation of culture into learning experiences played an important role in retention. Findings from this study, if operationalized, would allow geoscience departments to increase retention of Indigenous students and faculty, provide equitable educational opportunities, and to better understand how to effect cultural change in the geosciences by providing a welcoming and affirming space for Indigenous scholars.

AB  - Educational robotics has become one of the most effective methods to teach STEM concepts in a practical and didactic way at all educational level. In this context, the LEGO Mindstorms robotic platforms have been widely used due to their versatility ease of use and modularity. Despite this, most of the papers focus on K-12 and undergraduate levels, with little information reported in the literature about educational experiences at the graduate level. This article deals with the use of educational robotics for the teaching of mathematical concepts at the graduate level, and more specifically on the physical visualization of metrics (Euclidean, Taxicab, and Infinity), and the convergence of Cauchy sequence using a mobile robots LEGO Mindstorms NXT. The educational experience was applied to a group of graduate students who offered good comments on this type of educational activity and its usefulness to understand the mathematical concepts addressed. It was observed that this type of educational experiences motivates students to use mathematical concepts in interdisciplinary problems and encourages them to understand their functionality and application in the real world.

AB  - This article reviews 24 years of research focused on science education for students with learning and other disabilities. Our results are based on 53 articles from 2 relevant databases. We hereby present and discuss the results of the most popular topics investigated, which include: constructivism, exploratory learning, hands-on activities, cross-curricular projects, multiple means of representation, cognitive and social skills, group and peer learning, coursebooks, reading strategies, readability and students' assessment. Our results suggest that topics like teacher education, teacher/researcher co-operation, education policy, school administration and curriculum structure are scatteredly investigated. These experimental approaches and interventions may provide insight into teacher training in higher education and can explain controversial concepts regarding the question of "full inclusion, selective inclusion or excellency."

AB  - This study focused on teachers' transfer of a variety of teaching methods from a teaching module on nanotechnology, which is an example of a topic outside the science curriculum, to teaching topics that are part of the chemistry curriculum. Nanotechnology is outside the science curriculum, but it was used in this study as a means to carry out a change in the way chemistry teachers teach. The participants in the study included nine high school in-service chemistry teachers. Three research tools were used: (1) semistructured interviews that were conducted with the teachers, after they had finished teaching their nanotechnology module, and follow-up semistructured interviews that were conducted 2 years after the teachers had taught the nanotechnology module , and teachers' assessment and evaluation of their own teaching method, determining how the nanotechnology modules influenced the students who learned according to this program. The data collection process continued for 5 years. Most of the teachers indicated that they continued teaching the nanotechnology module that they designed and all of them stated that they integrated the unique teaching methods into their teaching of chemistry. High efficacy beliefs were built based on the self-evaluation process that was part of the teachers' professional development program. Teaching self-efficacy beliefs and organization efficacy beliefs was found to contribute to teachers' sustainable changes. The findings in the current research are only limited to the topic of nanotechnology; however, we believe that similar results can be obtained for any modern scientific topic that is outside the high school science curriculum. We suggest that more research should be done to determine whether the same findings emerge by using the same approach but on another topic.

AB  - The field of gifted and talented studies has its origins in the intelligence quotient research of the late 19th and early 20th century. These psychological foundations remain a strong influence even though the field has since expanded to include other paradigms and greater diversity in conceptions of giftedness and talent. Some researchers argue that the field could benefit from greater interdisciplinary engagement, especially in studies of gifted and talented girls, which tend to include a focus on how gifted girls' external environments influence their emotional worlds. This article proposes that concepts developed by critical sociologist Pierre Bourdieu are useful for expanding and deepening understandings of the internal and external worlds of gifted and talented girls. It offers evidence from a recent qualitative study with academically gifted and talented teenaged girls in New Zealand. The results highlighted the marginalised position of the gifted and talented identity and the privileging of identities that were based on dispositions versus innate ability. The study also identified a hierarchy of valued forms of capital within the teenage girl social landscape and a resulting theorisation of an empowered gifted and talented girl habitus. This article demonstrates how Bourdieu's work is a constructive addition to the field.

AB  - The competence-based education recently launched in Spanish universities presents a set of abilities and skills that are difficult to teach to students in higher and more technologically-oriented grades. In this paper, a teaching intervention that is based on design methodologies is proposed, to upgrade the competitive capacities of computer engineering students. In particular, this intervention targets those aspects relating to working in multidisciplinary teams and to defining requirements based on the user's empathy and knowledge. The main idea inspiring this technique is that the underlying challenge is a communication problem. As Brooks (1995) states in his book "The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering," even a project having all of the prerequisites for success (a clear mission, manpower, materials, time and adequate technology) could fail as a Tower of Babel. The proposed technique through mixed methods has been evaluated with students enrolled in different courses, confirming the repeatability and validity of this method from quantitative measurement, from observation of the results, and from ascertaining the value perceived by students and their attitudes.

AB  - Background: Although plant reproduction is a core subject in school science curricula, botanical topics are typically unpopular with students. Integrating the arts into science subject matter has the potential to increase student interest and understanding. Educational theatre has shown particular promise in this area. Purpose: The study examined how an interactive theatre performance, where professional actors deliver a performance but invite regular audience participation as a way to promote active learning, benefited both understanding of plant reproduction and attitudes towards plants. Perceptions of the play and the way in which specific elements influenced learning and emotions were examined in detail and placed in a theoretical context. Sample: Opportunity sampling was used to recruit participants from five public primary schools in Devon, UK. One hundred and forty-four students (aged 9-11 years) participated in the study. Design and methods: A mixed methods approach was adopted. Quantitative analysis of pre- and post-intervention knowledge tests involved t-tests and repeated measures ANCOVA. Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews made use of an emerging theme analysis with "a priori" categories. Results: Pre- and post-intervention tests indicated an increase in both knowledge of plant reproduction and positive attitudes towards plants. Follow-up interviews identified elements that were particularly beneficial for learning and enjoyment, including the thematic singing, humour, novelty of the play, visual elements and participatory art activities. Conclusions: This case study demonstrates the potential that an interactive theatre production offers for enhancing appreciation and interest in school science while improving knowledge.
