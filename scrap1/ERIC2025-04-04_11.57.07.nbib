AB  - At the heart of the vision for the Diploma in Science is a multidisciplinary approach to learning by tackling scientific challenges and questions in applied work-related contexts. This, together with the innovative delivery model offered by a consortia approach, will bridge a significant gap in the provision of science and mathematics education. The Diploma in Science is for learners who prefer to learn about scientific principles and concepts and to develop scientific skills by exploring the use of science in practical ways. These learners come from across the full ability range. The ability to apply scientific skills, concepts and principles, mathematical and statistical techniques, numeracy, problem-solving, team and presentational skills, financial and business awareness, IT and database skills, will all feature as learning outcomes of the Diploma in Science. These are learning outcomes that are being increasingly demanded by higher education and employers.

AB  - An environmental research project was carried out by a consortium established among scientists and university lecturers in collaboration with two high schools. High school students participated in a long-term study of the local temporal profiles of tropospheric ozone and the relationship to pollution and meteorological parameters. Low-cost research facilities for the high schools were obtained from public funds. The experimental setup provided a continuous source of data that was followed by the students under the supervision of the teachers. The participation was multidisciplinary (across various classes) and included activities related to the atmospheric study. The experience was motivating for students, providing them with a practical contact with science and the university. (Contains 2 notes, 1 table and 3 figures.)

AB  - Teachers often struggle to utilize reform-based teaching strategies in their first few years of teaching for many reasons (Ball, Thames & Phelps, Journal of Teacher Education 59, 389-407, 2008; Berlin & White, "International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education" 8, 97-115, 2010; Frykholm & Glasson, "School Science and Mathematics" 105, 127-141, 2005; Lederman & Lederman, Science Teacher Education 24, 1237-1240, 2013). An important part of teachers' learning to implement these pedagogically ambitious strategies is for teachers to experience learning themselves through an immersive experience in the new strategy (Louks-Horsley, Stiles, Mundry, Love & Hewson, "Designing professional development for teachers of science and mathematics," 2010). Building on this body of research and a host of recent national education standards documents, this paper explores the various dispositions early career high school science and math teachers from across the USA demonstrate when engaging together as learners in integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) tasks. Embedded within a multi-year professional development program, teachers were engaged in two integrated STEM tasks during two separate professional development experiences. Following the tasks, teachers responded to writing prompts asking them to reflect on their experience during the tasks. Analysis of the reflections about the integrated STEM tasks fell into two broad categories of dispositions: engager and observer. The data suggest various strategies for professional development providers who are interested in providing professional development focused on integrated STEM instruction.

AB  - The content of the expertise which young natural scientists try to gain by doing science in research groups is a relatively little-explored subject. What makes learning in such settings challenging is that a central part of the expertise is tacit. This study employs empirical methods together with a contextualized approach and interdisciplinary cooperation in order to reveal practicing nanomodellers' (N = 10) perspectives on their knowledge-building expertise, and on young scientists' expertise education. Modelling in the virtual world plays a major role in the science of these nanomodellers, as it increasingly does in many fields of science. This study therefore adds to our understanding of the nature of recent scientific knowledge building and expertise development, which can be used in the education of the scientists of the future.

AB  - The unity of knowledge represents an old idea with new manifestations. During the last decades integrated approaches in teaching and learning have become increasingly popular. Applications of integrative approaches between the arts and other school subjects exist in many countries around the world, offering insights into the problems and challenges that such efforts can result into. In this paper a short review of the relevant literature in support of integrative curricula, as well as problems and concerns caused by their application, will set the basis for the description of the practice-based research project that is reported. The project brought together a kindergarten teacher and two researchers, under a collaborative model of inquiry in a pre-primary school setting in Cyprus. An attempt was made to enrich the teaching of musical concepts through the use of activities and practices borrowed from other disciplines. More specifically, the study sought to investigate whether children's understanding of the music concepts taught was evident, what was the children's response to the designed units and what were the teacher's perceptions of the educational atmosphere before and after the application of the designed units. Six half-hour music lessons, comprising two different units--pitch and tempo--were taught and videotaped. The design of the different units and the organization and choice of activities, apart from drawing from the literature on integration, was heavily based on the theory of multiple intelligences by H. Gardner. A "follow-up" video stimulated recall interview was conducted at the end of each unit. The videotaped lessons, the observation field notes, the interviews with the teacher, the teacher's self reflection as well as the feedback by the researchers, provided both a wealth of data as well as interesting interpretations. The findings suggest that the pre-primary school children that participated in the study responded with enthusiasm to innovative activities that related music with other subjects. In addition, each child was given the opportunity to better understand the concepts taught through his/her own ways of learning. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Cross-cultural education is thought to develop critical consciousness of how unequal distributions of power and privilege affect people's health. Learners in different sociopolitical settings can join together in developing critical consciousness--awareness of power and privilege dynamics in society--by means of communication technology. The aim of this research was to define strengths and limitations of existing cross-cultural discussions in generating critical consciousness. The setting was the FAIMER international fellowship program for mid-career interdisciplinary health faculty, whose goal is to foster global advancement of health professions education. Fellows take part in participant-led, online, written, task-focused discussions on topics like professionalism, community health, and leadership. We reflexively identified text that brought sociopolitical topics into the online environment during the years 2011 and 2012 and used a discourse analysis toolset to make our content analysis relevant to critical consciousness. While references to participants' cultures and backgrounds were infrequent, narratives of political-, gender-, religion-, and other culture-related topics did emerge. When participants gave accounts of their experiences and exchanged cross-cultural stories, they were more likely to develop ad hoc networks to support one another in facing those issues than explore issues relating to the development of critical consciousness. We suggest that cross-cultural discussions need to be facilitated actively to transform learners' frames of reference, create critical consciousness, and develop cultural competence. Further research is needed into how to provide a safe environment for such learning and provide faculty development for the skills needed to facilitate these exchanges.

AB  - The MLA Report on "Foreign Languages and Higher Education: New Structures for a Changed World" has been criticized for focusing its proposals on large German programs. This article attempts to show how some of its recommendations can also be implemented in smaller language programs. These programs exist within a network of relations to other academic programs in their institution with which they both compete and collaborate in order to perform and grow, such as the proliferating International Studies major. Inter-institutional collaboration can also open up opportunities for richer course offerings than what one small German program could provide. Designing a curriculum that encourages students, especially those from the science and technology disciplines, to double major in German Studies and achieve a high level of proficiency, includes components such as flexible groups of electives, mandatory study abroad or internship abroad, and courses tailored to a student audience interested in science and technology. This includes cultural studies courses that follow a model of interdisciplinarity with the potential for connections with other disciplines. In this article these are explored and illustrated with examples from a course on "Green Germany." Finally, measures of success are addressed, including ways that even a small German Studies program can establish and maintain its relevance and value in a range of institutional contexts.

AB  - In view of the research on education--and subject-related education in particular--that has been conducted in recent years, it would seem useful to describe the current state and future trends of research on science teaching and learning. In the present article, research findings are described, the deficits of science education are analyzed, and medium- and long-term research goals are specified from the perspective of an interdisciplinary cooperative effort between specialists in the fields of empirical educational research; the psychology of learning and instruction; and biology, chemistry, and physics education.

AB  - The integration of ideas, methods, and data from diverse disciplines has been a transformative force in science and higher education, attracting policy interventions, program innovations, financial resources, and talented people. Much energy has been invested in producing a new generation of scientists trained to work fluidly across disciplines, sectors, and research problems, yet the success of such investments has been difficult to measure. Using the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) program of the U.S. National Science Foundation as a strategic research site, we conducted an experiment to determine whether and how the process and products of research of IGERT-trained scientists differ from those of scientists trained in disciplinary graduate programs. Among scientists in the early years of graduate study we found substantial and consistent differences suggesting that interdisciplinary training improved the quality and process of research, but this pattern was equally strongly reversed among students in the latter years of graduate study. Using systematic observation and other data we suggest why this might be so, then discuss the implications of these results for the design and conduct of graduate education and research.

AB  - Far too few high-school students choose subjects from the natural sciences (NaSc) for their majors in many countries. Even fewer study biology, chemistry or physics at university. Those, that do, often lack training to present and discuss scientific results and ideas in texts. To meet these challenges the center for didactics of biology of Graz University has set up the program "Young Science Journalism." This new workshop-based interdisciplinary concept was tested in an exploratory study with grade 10 students of one Austrian high school, engaging both the biology and the German teacher of the class. It was our aim to raise students' interest in the NaSc by encouraging them to write popular scientific articles about self-chosen topics, and to help them improve their writing competence. In this paper we focus on interest development through writing. Results from this pilot study were promising. Using a mixed-method approach (comparing pre- and post-test questionnaires and semi-structured interviews from different time points analyzed qualitatively), we found that almost all students valued the project-related work highly. Most of them showed higher interest in the NaSc at project end with girls, in average, seeming to profit more from project participation. We thus recommend integrating such writing tasks into school curricula to increase students' interest in NaSc or to even create new interest. Additionally, we introduce a network presentation of questionnaire data as a powerful tool to visualize the effect of an intervention on individual students and student profile groups.

AB  - More collaborative work in the humanities could be instrumental in helping to break down the traditional rigid boundaries between academic divisions and disciplines in modern universities. The value of the traditional model of the solitary humanities scholar or the collaborative science paradigm should not be discounted. However, increasing the use of collaborative and interdisciplinary research models in the humanities would promote new forms of scholarship and also help to create a better, more integral and inclusive world.

AB  - Here we examine the role art activities play in aesthetic experience and learning of science. We compare recordings of two sequential occurrences in an elementary school class. The purpose of the first sequence was scientific and involved the children in observing leaves with magnifiers. The second sequence had an artistic purpose, where the children made pictures of leaves by rubbing them with crayons. The material was analyzed by means of practical epistemology analysis, Dewey's philosophy of aesthetics and socio-cultural approaches using the concept of mediation. The results show that what was mediated in the two sequences differed; the mediating artefacts used thereby having an effect on learning. The children also learned how to take part in the activities aesthetically. What the results mean for the use of artistic activities in science education is discussed.

AB  - Teachers, both of science and of religion, have to help pupils to learn about the links between these subjects. An effective way to support this learning should start from the beliefs and ideas that pupils already have, ideas which might well be influenced by public debates, often characterised by controversy, between those holding strong beliefs about the two areas. This article aims to give teachers a framework of information and argument to guide their design of teaching in this overlap area. In the "first" of three main sections, there is a summary account of the history of the science-religion relationships, showing that over the last two millennia they have oscillated between positive support and negative controversy. A "second" section analyses this history in terms of three models of the relationship. One is a model of conflict in which each disputes the knowledge claims of the other. Another is one of mutual independence in which each accepts to work within its side of an agreed boundary. Finally, there is a model of collaboration, in which each discerns positive contributions that the other can make to its own insights. The "third" main section discusses the implications of the preceding analyses for curriculum and pedagogy in both science education and religious education, with a stress on the similarity between the pedagogic aims and values to which teachers of both subjects should work.

AB  - The relevance of the problem under study is based on the necessity to achieve effectiveness of the learning process aimed at forming a competent specialist and ensuring the quality of training of vocational teacher of a certain subject (design). The aim of the article is to provide theoretical substantiation, to elaborate and to test the structural-conceptual model of forming artistic-design competency of vocational design teacher which is important for successful professional activity within the mobile environment of modern production and learning process. The leading approach to studying the problem is the system approach which allows to review the learning process in interdisciplinary interaction that ensures integration of educational subjects' content into a united professional field of activity to contribute to formation of professional competencies of vocational teacher. The structural-conceptual model of forming artistic-design competency of vocational design teacher is presented and includes the following blocks: scientific-methodological which includes fundamentals of social, historical and natural sciences, and practice-oriented including educational activity determined by specific features of designer's activity which requires knowledge and process algorithms that ensure execution of certain artistic and design-creative tasks. The structural-conceptual model is aimed at forming the artistic-design competency of vocational design teachers, ensures effectiveness and quality of students' education, as well as their adaptation to changing environment of professional activity. The materials can be useful for academic researchers and practitioners in the sphere of professional and vocational education, as well as for candidates for a master's degree and students of vocational universities, institutes and faculties.

AB  - Imaging techniques provide ways of knowing structure and function in biology at different scales. The multidisciplinary nature and rapid advancement of imaging sciences requires imaging education to begin early in the biology curriculum. Guided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap initiatives, we incorporated a nanoimaging, molecular imaging, and medical imaging teaching unit into three 1-h class periods of an introductory course on ways of knowing biology. Activities were derived from NIH Roadmap initiatives in nanomedicine, regenerative medicine, and nuclear medicine. The course materials we describe contributed positively to student learning gains in quantifying and interpreting images, in characterizing imaging methods that provide ways of knowing biological structure and function, and in understanding scale in biology and imaging. The NIH Roadmap provides a useful context to educate students about the multidisciplinary imaging continuum. (Contains 3 tables and 4 figures.)

AB  - The beginning of modern science is marked by efforts of pioneers to understand the natural world using a quantitative approach. As Galileo wrote, "the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics". The traditional undergraduate course curriculum is heavily focused on individual disciplines like biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics rather than interdisciplinary courses. This fragmented teaching of sciences in majority of universities leave biology outside the quantitative and mathematical approaches. The landscape of biomedical science has transformed dramatically with advances in high throughput experimental approaches, which led to the huge amount of data. The best possible approach to generate insights into the biological problem using this huge amount of collected data is to employ the strength of mathematics. Since the people trained only in either biology or mathematics will not be of great help in this pursuit, there is a great demand to prepare trained workforce in the interdisciplinary field of mathematical biology. With this aim, we developed and offered a four hundred level interdisciplinary undergraduate course on mathematical biology at the University of Dayton. The results from exit surveys of the students who participated in the course are promising. They strongly felt their experience was conducive to learning and strongly evoked their interest in the study of science. Here we present the details of the course and its outcome on student enquiry and learning habits. (Contains 3 figures.)

AB  - This paper presents a comparative study of research performance of 11 East and Southeast Asian countries based upon the total number of peer-refereed international publications (PRIP) per one million people (research intensity), the mean citation, and the contribution of domestic authors in PRIP production. Large gaps are observed within the region in the three above dimensions reflecting the disparities among countries in the levels of socio-economic development. Vietnam is among countries of low research intensity in the region having 9.3 PRIPs per one million people in 2008. Other weaknesses includes the heavy reliance on foreign authors, the low numbers of PRIPs on applied and multidisciplinary fields, and the modest contribution from Vietnamese universities in PRIP production. The paper suggests approaches that should be taken for enhancing research capability and reshaping science and higher education system in Vietnam.

AB  - Both the National Science Education Standards (NSES) and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) recommend appropriately incorporating mathematics into other disciplines (NRC 1996; NRC 2003; NCTM 2000). With this in mind, an interdisciplinary, inquiry-based project was undertaken to incorporate mathematical analysis of data into a physiology course and to give both physiology and statistics students' real data with which to work. The project involved collaboration between the two classes in data collection, analysis, and presentation. Results of the pre- and post assessments indicate that the attitudinal and cognitive objectives were met using this model. (Contains 4 figures and 5 tables.)

AB  - This paper introduces a new pedagogic approach to the teaching of political science. In engineering education, the Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate (CDIO) pedagogy provides an active, experiential learning experience, structuring learning around four key phases in product development. Applied to the undergraduate Politics and International Relations (IR) classroom, this pedagogical innovation in learning, teaching and assessment is adapted to policy development. This design-build-test pedagogical approach has been highly successful in engineering education, supporting students to be "industry-ready engineers" on graduation. Results across 3 cohorts suggest that this pedagogical innovation is also highly successful when transferred to Politics and IR, supporting political science students develop "society-ready" attitudes, attributes and skills, greatly enhancing the student experience and increasing their attainment, engagement, inclusion and wider graduate outcomes. Civic engagement and the ability to understand and respond to a range of stakeholders are also improved. This paper presents the pedagogy and the module to which it was applied as a case study, before highlighting opportunities for political science educators to transfer the pedagogy to their own teaching context.

AB  - Science education trends promote student engagement in authentic knowledge in practice to tackle personally consequential problems. This study explored how partnering scientists and students on a social media platform supported students' development of disciplinary practice knowledge through practice-based learning with experts during two pilot enactments of a project-based curriculum focusing on the ecological impacts of climate change. Through the online platform, scientists provided feedback on students' infographics, visual argumentation artifacts that use data to communicate about climate change science. We conceptualize the infographics and professional data sets as boundary objects that supported authentic argumentation practices across classroom and professional contexts, but found that student generated data was not robust enough to cross these boundaries. Analysis of the structure and content of the scientists' feedback revealed that when critiquing argumentation, scientists initiated engagement in multiple scientific practices, supporting a holistic rather than discrete model of practice-based learning. While traditional classroom inquiry has emphasized student experimentation, we found that engagement with existing professional data sets provided students with a platform for developing expertise in systemic scientific practices during argument construction. We further found that many students increased the complexity and improved the visual presentation of their arguments after feedback.

AB  - This paper describes how a gamified rewards and penalties framework was used to increase attendance and engagement in a level six undergraduate computing module teaching game production. The framework was applied to the same module over two consecutive years: a control year and a trial year. In both years the tutor, assignments and assessment strategies were the same and daily attendance was recorded. In the module, students work in multi-disciplinary teams to complete an assignment to build a computer game prototype. Unequal contribution to team projects by other students is a frequently voiced complaint to lecturers setting team assignments: a problem which is only partially solved by peer assessments, which are a retrospective analysis. The gamification framework provides a method for the lecturer to quickly identify disengaging students and to re-motivate them. Partnership between student and teacher, both parties must present themselves in order for that exchange of knowledge to take place. If unequal team contribution is a constant problem for students, then empty lecture halls can be considered similarly difficult for educators. This paper addresses three key points: 1) Does the rewards/penalties framework improve attendance? 2) If yes, does improved attendance result in improved assessments? 3) Does the framework improve engagement and performance in student teams? This paper presents quantitative evidence to answer the first two and offers speculative comments on the third. Initial results suggest that the rewards and penalties framework improves attendance and increases student performance and overall grade. Speculatively, the framework appears to be effective in increasing motivation. Informal student commentary indicates that while motivation is not improved across the cohort, those that are motivated contribute significantly more time and effort to the project. Rewards proved successful in improving completion of previously resisted tasks and in attracting students to attend classes they would otherwise miss.

AB  - This paper explores the foundational principles of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) as an integrative teaching strategy designed deliberately to cross discipline boundaries in order to make meaningful and lasting connections. The authors suggest that while PBL has in recent times has largely manifested towards a method of inquiry within a single discipline the founding principles and key characteristics that inform PBL may be applied to solving technological inquiry where an understanding and application of scientific principles is fundamental in informing and developing the preferred solution. This paper highlights that in order to be effective classroom educators, in an ever increasing and complex world, pre-service teachers' need to develop robust mental models and metacognitive skills that are transferable. In supporting this development the rationale and the application of PBL as an integrated teaching and learning strategy in pre-service science and technology education will be examined. This paper suggests that PBL is an effective strategy in supporting inquiry of an interdisciplinary nature as well as developing dispositions that embrace collaborative inquiry and reflective practice.

AB  - The COVID-19 global pandemic created new challenges for teachers and school systems as teachers were forced to rapidly transition to remote learning using new digital tools and resources. Teaching elementary science in "normal times" is challenging due to issues involving teacher preparation, limited access to materials and lack of administrative support due to emphasis on tested subjects, among others. Using reform-based, inquiry practices is challenging when teaching science face-to-face and even more so in an online environment. Compounded with issues of access and equity, teachers faced many problems with moving elementary science instruction online due to COVID-19. This study reports on the experiences of 10 early career teachers who were graduates of a specialized elementary science concentration. Teachers reflect on the challenges faced, how they adapted, and how they designed new learning contexts to teach science. Teachers report on resources they found beneficial, assess needs for the future, and explain how they worked to maintain a sense of community for their students during this unprecedented critical time.

AB  - Many students struggle to interconnect biochemistry and molecular biology (BMB) contents taught in separate classes or to relate BMB to what they learn in other courses. Such students lack the necessary perspective to perceive the intradisciplinary and interdisciplinary "bonds" of BMB. In other words used before in this journal, they are unable to see the tertiary and quaternary structure of BMB. Teachers of BMB must strongly consider how to change this if they wish their students to understand what they want them to learn. Integration offers an opportunity to help students make connections, to learn better how to scaffold and organize their BMB. More and better integration will always be good news for student-centered education and should thus be strongly encouraged. Interdisciplinary integration relates to curricular structure. Therefore, perhaps it makes sense to look at integration as a feature with levels of progressive complexity. Picturing integration by levels is empowering and makes integration feasible.

AB  - This paper examines the roles that 52 university Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students play in an Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Partnership that connects several middle schools, high schools, institutions of higher learning, businesses, and community institutions. It also examines the support these students feel are necessary to be successful in their roles, as well as what they feel the experience has taught them about science communication. Results from both qualitative and quantitative data, including surveys, interviews, observations, and artifact collection indicate that the most common experiences that the students had in the schools were assisting teachers in conducting labs, leading small group activities/discussions with students in class, demonstrating scientific content, procedures, tools, and techniques, and assisting teachers in teaching lessons. Most students felt these activities benefited their ability to work as a team, lead a team, facilitate group discussions, teach STEM concepts and methods, and generate others' interest in STEM research and activities. However, it was found that some tasks that the students were involved in provided more of a chance to practice their science communication skills than others. In order to be successful in these roles, nearly all of the students felt that support from the classroom teacher they were working with was necessary.

AB  - This article describes a unit in which students were able to create projects that went far beyond the initial scope of what the authors imagined due to the scaffolded and sociocultural learning environment (Vygotsky, 1978). The article begins with an explanation of constructivism, design thinking, and Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM), as they relate to the approach used in the authors' classroom. Students learned from and with their classmates, but also differentiated projects to meet individual vision. While the students might have gained similar knowledge about computer programming and circuitry through a classic scientific and technology unit, it would not have engaged students to consider issues of aesthetics, the design process, and the notion of using technology as a tool to transform their ideas into reality. The complementary interdisciplinary approach worked, because the theme of transformation was enhanced by using discipline-based knowledge from the fields of art, science, and technology (Hayes-Jacob, 1989). By using an approach based in design, the authors found that STEAM education, at the elementary level, provided opportunities for students to develop understandings of complex concepts through engaging projects that break down barriers between disciplines. While art education has seen dramatic shifts in terms of content and focus in the last 20 years, STEAM education offers further opportunities for the field. Educators have struggled to actualize the vision of progressive educators who aimed to centralize education around students, their knowledge, and their experiences. STEAM education opens the door to integrate design thinking as part of the K-12 educational experience.

AB  - Can questions sent to Open-Educational-Resource (OER) websites such as Ask-An-Expert serve as indicators for students' interest in science? This issue was examined using an online questionnaire which included an equal number of questions about the topics "space" and "nutrition" randomly selected from three different sources: a 5th-grade science textbook, the "Ask-An-Expert" website, and questions collected from other students in the same age group. A sample of 113 5th-graders from two elementary schools were asked to rate their interest level in finding out the answer to these questions without knowledge of their source. Significant differences in students' interest level were found between questions: textbook questions were ranked lowest for both subjects, and questions from the open-resource were ranked high. This finding suggests that questions sent to an open-resource could be used as an indicator of students' interest in science. In addition, the high correlation of interests expressed by students from the two schools may point to a potential generalization of the findings. This study contributes by highlighting OER as a new and promising indicator of student interest, which may help bring "student voices" into main-stream science teaching to increase student interest in science.

AB  - Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Project Green Reach (PGR) is a children's program that has offered garden-based youth education since 1990. PGR focuses on Grade K-8 students and teachers from local Title I schools who work in teams on garden and science projects. In this exploratory study, the authors used field observations, document analysis, and past participant interviews to investigate PGR's program, model informal science education, and document the influence of the program on urban youth. In all, 7 themes emerged: (a) participants' challenging home and school environments, (b) changes in academic and interdisciplinary skills, (c) changes in science and gardening skills, (d) increased environmental awareness, (e) social and personal growth, (f) a positive life experience, and (g) the cultural significance of the program.

AB  - In response to a paper calling for the re-engagement of agricultural education with the sciences and science education, this essay is supportive but argues to proceed with caution: one that at first does no harm. I offer a supplementary lens and story of change at Cornell University as a cautionary and motivational tale. I concur with the authors who want to redirect faculty, departments, and societies of agricultural educators to become more tightly aligned with the sciences. The need for and ability to better contribute to the critical discussions on contemporary agriculture issues (e.g., urban farming, GMOs, sustainability, local economies) is timely and important. The trick, however, is to do this without weakening the agricultural education community to the point of extinction. Drawing on Institutional Theory, I offer an enhanced perspective highlighting the importance of resource, conformity, and legitimacy. I explore the nature of competing pressures: the strong and restrictive ties to isolated communities and the pressure to reengage a community with a more socially and intellectually central world. I want to emphasize how these strong ties are typically beneficial to the organizations of interest, despite what it may look like to others outside that sector. It is argued that agricultural education will become increasingly "vulnerable and isolated" should it not cross the street and at least partially connect with contemporary science, social science, and new policy and ethical concerns.

AB  - Contests are usually applied in the academic environment to simulate real professional situations that require from the participants a more pro-active attitude than the one shown in conventional coursework. Although they are commonly applied in the scope of a unique course, the contest described here was an extracurricular experience applied in an Information System undergraduate program. The evaluation of the contest is also presented; the objective was to assess the role of the contest as a tool to bring together interdisciplinary subjects, complementary to the traditional disciplinary structure of the program curriculum. The results indicate that a significant portion of the participants noticed increase in their knowledge after the contest, which is verified by statistical tests. However, students from the first stages received more benefits, probably because such students were more motivated and had more available time to be involved in the contest activities.

AB  - Demonstration shows are a popular form of chemical education outreach used to increase interest, engagement, and appreciation of chemistry. Although practitioners often include instructional elements, evaluation has been limited to children's attitudes toward science rather than their understanding of the underlying concepts presented. In 2006, we developed an interdisciplinary demonstration show that used elements from theater to engage children's minds, emotions, imaginations, and bodies in the act of learning. The result was "The Amazing Chemical Circus", a show that laid the groundwork for a new model of science education outreach that we call Fusion Science Theater. Assessments of learning following presentations of "The Amazing Chemical Circus" indicate significant gains in children's conceptual knowledge as well as their attitudes toward science. In this article, we draw parallels between scientific investigation and theatrical practices that reveal common underlying principles at work. We also report on the show's development, form, content, evaluation, and impact. Finally, we outline the Fusion Science Theater model, and briefly discuss the implications for chemical educators and students who wish to enhance their own outreach efforts.

AB  - To remain competitive in an increasingly interdisciplinary world, graduate education must produce professionals who can understand both their scientific disciplines and the business environment in which they work. With the addition of applied learning components outside of the traditional scientific laboratory and training in business skills, Professional Science Master's programs (PSMs) help higher education adapt to this changing environment. The current study illustrates some models of PSMs and contains information on how institutions interested in using PSMs as a way to enhance applied learning at the graduate level can get started.

AB  - Many basic scientists including anatomists are currently involved in decisions related to revisions of the undergraduate medical curriculum. Integration is a common theme in many of these decisions. As described by Harden, integration can occur along a multistep continuum from independent, discipline-based courses to a completely interdisciplinary curriculum. For anatomy, each derivative of curricular integration can be shown to involve progressive disruptions of the temporal and topographical relationship between organ systems in a body region, of the temporal relationship with other courses in a harmonized curriculum, and of the relationships between components of organ systems when integration is implemented in thematic curricula. Drawing from our experience teaching in various types of integrated medical curricula, we encourage readers to proceed cautiously with their curricular decisions because each one can have gains and losses that may impact learning in the new format.

AB  - The article deals with the study of foreign experience in training engineering educators for modeling technological processes. It has been stated that engineering education is a field that is being dramatically developed taking into account the occurring changes in educational paradigms, global higher education space, national higher education systems, economics, society, etc. It has been indicated that the abundance of the latest information and communication technologies alter the approaches to training various specialists, and, in particular, engineering educators. It has been mentioned that engineering teacher education is undergoing significant development. The activities of the International Society for Engineering Education--IGIP have been justified. It has been found out that there is the vital need for those specialists able to combine the techniques of traditional teaching and innovative scientific achievements, design technical structures, be leader and facilitator of the education process. It has been defined that the activity of the society is aimed at providing engineering educators with relevant training that involves their obtaining the qualification that is accorded with European education standards. US experience in training engineering educators for professional activity has been analyzed. It has been specified that engineering education has become more integrated into the curricula of elementary, middle and high school because of the increasing focus on STEM subjects; the demand for engineering educators is dramatically growing at all the levels of the education system. The peculiarities of engineering educators' training have been demonstrated on the example of the Purdue Polytechnic Institute. It has been concluded that Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology Teacher Education is a rather interdisciplinary degree program and trains future engineering educators for a wide range of fields. The organization of the program is considerate and well-planned. It has been stated that in Great Britain future engineering educators should be able to apply innovative and less conventional teaching methodology, namely, via problem-based learning, virtual learning environment, etc. According to the mentioned above, the author has outlined the recommendations to improve engineering teacher education in Ukraine.

AB  - At the University of Vermont, an interdisciplinary faculty team developed an introductory watershed science field course. This course honed field skills and catalyzed communication across water-related disciplines without requiring specific prerequisites. Five faculty (geology, engineering, geography, natural resources) taught the four-credit course, highlighting interactions between the hydrosphere, biosphere, and solid Earth. The course, based in the Winooski River watershed, followed the river from its headwaters downstream to its outlet in Lake Champlain focusing on data collection and analysis methods, while exploring threats to this freshwater ecosystem. This course was offered as a summer field course in 2007. Student learning was assessed using weekly summative assignments and final presentations incorporating field data and acquired knowledge. Attitude and knowledge surveys, administered before and after this first year, documented increased self-assessed learning, affinity for the field learning environment, and that the course provided training relevant to various disciplines. The fiscally unsustainable summer model, and course evaluations guided major revisions to the course. The second offering, in 2009, met weekly during spring term to provide students with context before a two-week field component. This field component was held immediately after classes ended to avoid the need to pay faculty summer salaries.

AB  - In this chapter, the authors discuss the potential, value, and barriers to supporting PCK in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines through collaborations across learning settings, with special attention to the role of informal science learning institutions in preservice teacher preparation. Particular focus is provided on the National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded Math and Science Teacher Education Residency (MASTER) program for teacher preparation. MASTER is a collaborative among the New York Hall of Science, Hunter College School of Education, and the New York City Department of Education through New Visions for Public Schools.

AB  - This self-study addresses two questions: (1) how did self-study aid the teacher educator in interrogating her beliefs about and mediate her projection of teacher-as-facilitator versus teacher-as-expert? and (2) in what ways did prospective elementary teachers in an undergraduate, interdisciplinary science course exert control over their learning as a result of the teacher educator's self-interrogation of practices? In her teaching role with prospective teachers, Nicole explored a major myth about teaching concerning the image of the professor as the primary expert in the classroom. Critical events analysis revealed instances where she exerted power as an expert or assumed the role of facilitator. Instead of clearly marked instances where she took actions to exert her various roles in the classroom, she found that classroom events could not be categorized neatly. There were cases where she acted as an expert and students felt free to make their own decisions about their learning. When she was uncertain or attempted to relinquish control, students often responded by not taking control of their learning.

AB  - Probably owing to the prejudice that gold is a metal too noble to be used much in chemistry, the chemistry of this element has developed much later than that of its congeners and neighbors in the periodic table. In fact, before and after the time of alchemists, and up to the 20th century, all chemistry of gold was mainly performed in attempts to provide humans with more gold metal for jewelry and coinage. The potential of the chemistry of gold was left largely unexplored. Now, within only a quarter of a century, gold chemistry has become one of the most popular areas of research and technology. In mostly interdisciplinary endeavors, gold and its alloys and compounds have become the focus of projects in quantum chemistry, homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, surface science, metal clusters, nanotechnology, photophysics, and medicine. As a particular benefit, these application-oriented studies have further promoted investigations into the fundamentals of the chemistry of this element. Gold exhibits some extreme properties owing to particularly strong relativistic effects. This review summarizes several recent exciting advances in gold chemistry.

AB  - Addressed is the current practice in educational reform of reducing time for science instruction in favor of traditional reading/language arts instruction. In contrast, presented is an evidence-based rationale for increasing instructional time for K-5 science instruction as an educational reform initiative. Overviewed are consensus interdisciplinary research and complementary multi-year findings of the Science IDEAS model demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating conceptually-relevant reading within science instruction in improving student achievement in both science and reading comprehension. Based on research summarized, increasing time for integrated K-5 science is advocated as a meaningful reform-based approach to science learning and reading comprehension proficiency that, in turn, better prepares students for subsequent success in science and content-area reading comprehension across upper elementary and middle school grades (3-8).

AB  - "To confess the truth, Mrs. B., I am not disposed to form a very favorable idea of chemistry, nor do I expect to derive much entertainment from it." That 200-year-old statement by Caroline to Mrs. Bryan, her teacher, appeared on the first page of Jane Marcet's pioneering secondary school textbook, "Conversations on Chemistry". It was published 17 years after Antoine Lavoisier's "Elements of Chemistry" and 2 years prior to John Dalton's "A New System of Chemical Philosophy". Caroline's classic comment foreshadows what many students have expressed since chemistry appeared as an early 19th-century school subject. Post-"Sputnik" efforts to capture students' interest and engagement, or, in Robert Mager's words, "approach tendencies", can be regarded as contemporary responses to Caroline's views. This is a summary of several collaborative initiatives and experiences since "Sputnik's" launch intended to stimulate student involvement in their learning. Among these are the Chemical Education Material (CHEM) Study project, the Chemical Bond Approach (CBA) project, Interdisciplinary Approaches to Chemistry (IAC), "Chemistry in the Community" (ChemCom), "SourceBook", and the National Science Education Standards.

AB  - This article describes the design and implementation of a business proposal module for final-year science students at a tertiary institution in Hong Kong. It is argued that in the needs analysis process, the present situation analysis (PSA), that is, personal information about the learners and factors which may affect their learning, is just as if not more important than, the target situation analysis (TSA), that is, professional information about the learners in terms of their future language requirements. The PSA aspect of the needs analysis was found to present several constraints impinging on the course design, which required compromises and adaptations to be made to how the course was originally envisaged. The module adopts the case-study approach which is advocated in the literature on EOP as it mirrors the activities and practices of a real-life business situation. The article describes how key teaching points (socio-pragmatic competence, the issue of "glocalisation", communication with impression, genre conventions and interdisciplinarity, and usage errors) are addressed within the case-study approach.

AB  - Basic phylogenetics and associated "tree thinking" are often minimized or excluded in formal school curricula. Informal settings provide an opportunity to extend the K-12 school curriculum, introducing learners to new ideas, piquing interest in science, and fostering scientific literacy. Similarly, university researchers participating in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) outreach activities increase awareness of college and career options and highlight interdisciplinary fields of science research and augment the science curriculum. To aid in this effort, we designed a 6-h module in which students utilized 12 flowering plant species to generate morphological and molecular phylogenies using biological techniques and bioinformatics tools. The phylogenetics module was implemented with 83 high school students during a weeklong university STEM immersion program and aimed to increase student understanding of phylogenetics and coevolution of plants and pollinators. Student response reflected positive engagement and learning gains as evidenced through content assessments, program evaluation surveys, and program artifacts. We present the results of the first year of implementation and discuss modifications for future use in our immersion programs as well as in multiple course settings at the high school and undergraduate levels.

AB  - Previous research has shown that questioning is a key strategy that facilitators use to promote discussion in Problem-Based Learning (PBL). Yet, there is a lack of detailed understanding on what questions facilitators ask and how those questions affect discussion. In this study we examined different types of questions that experienced facilitators asked to promote discussion of teaching problems in professional development for science teachers. We videotaped six PBL sessions facilitated by three pairs of experienced facilitators. Data analysis showed that facilitators asked a set of questions to initiate and advance PBL discourse, including questions to solicit ideas, to reframe ideas, to clarify ideas, to push for elaboration, to check for interpretation, and to connect to teachers' classroom practice. This study has implications for the development of PBL facilitators.

AB  - For successful and productive careers, undergraduate students need effective communication and critical thinking skills; information literacy is a substantial component in the development of these skills. Students often perceive communication courses as distinct and separate from their chosen discipline. Faculty from the Departments of English and Horticulture and the library at Iowa State University collaborated in a foundation communication course (English 250). The course incorporates five components--finding information sources; evaluating information sources; and preparing an annotated bibliography, a research paper, and a research poster--all within the context of horticulture. The objective of the collaboration was to integrate communication and information literacy concepts into English 250 and relate these concepts to the students' discipline of horticulture. Assessment data and focus group discussions strongly validate students' appreciation for an interdisciplinary approach to teaching communication and information literacy skills within the discipline.

AB  - To bridge the gap between science and policy, future scientists should receive training that incorporates policy implications into the design, analysis, and communication of research. We present a student Science and Policy course for undergraduate science majors piloted at the University of California, Berkeley in the summer of 2011. During this program, pairs of students undertake research projects while receiving instruction in both research methods and science translation. In addition to completing short-term research projects, the students produce materials designed to communicate their results to decision makers and the public. This article provides a detailed description of this course's organization and structure and a preliminary evaluation. Suggestions for others interested in designing (and conducting educational research on) a similar interdisciplinary program are provided. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)

AB  - Over the past 20 years, claims about how and why student writing can serve learning have changed markedly. This has been partly due to new technologies displacing writing as a predominant resource for learning, prompting new sense-making practices and shifts in how these changes are theorized. Learners now routinely collaborate to generate, manipulate, analyze, and share images in many subject areas, where multimodal and multimedia resources are expected to motivate learners, enact new learning processes and outcomes, and display this cross-modal learning. These new practices have prompted revisions to how writing is understood and used as a tool for learning in an increasingly multimodal, highly digitized world. In reviewing this literature, we claim that there are strong evidence-based reasons for viewing writing as a central but not sole resource for learning. Our case draws on both past and current research on writing as an epistemological tool. In presenting this case, we draw primarily on our professional background in science education research, acknowledging its distinctive take on the use of writing for learning. However, we think our general case also holds for other disciplinary areas.

AB  - A unique undergraduate team that spans five different engineering disciplines, chemistry, biology, and mathematics was formed. The team was formed to promote cross-disciplinary learning, to improve retention, and to prepare the students for the kind of problems they will face in their careers. This paper describes the variety of activities used over 2 years to tie the team together, as well as afford opportunities to develop team-building skills. The activities described highlight the critical elements of a faculty leader whose own work is interdisciplinary, correct balance of disciplines in the team, and sufficient time for team development. The use of external feedback was essential for all activities. Clearly defined goals and hard deadlines were critical for the completion of individual activities, as well as developing a healthy team environment. Although the student cohort has learned from the activities, more time is needed to assess whether the students have become a fully efficient team. Furthermore, an additional cohort would be needed to assess whether the approach was able to assist with student's interest in STEM and their desire to help other people.

AB  - The relevance of the problem under study is based on the influence of the expanding globalization processes that affect the view of life of a modern man: the internal balance is lost due to feeling of chaos, rhythm of life and constant changes. In these conditions there is a tendency to de-humanize the living environment, depersonalization of living space and desacralization of human dwelling which leads to re-thinking of the Home that ensures human existence in the world. The purpose of the article is to state the necessity of new understanding of the Home as the phenomenon of culture which would confront the absolute priority of the rational, pragmatic and utilitarian through the notion of "the innermost", through studying the transformation of the innermost within the historical context and through revealing the dialectics of the innermost and the explicit in living space of the modern culture. The lead method for studying this problem is the interdisciplinary approach that provides the possibility of comprehensive consideration of the results of philosophical, cultural, architectural and other studies. The article reveals the essence and the main philosophical-cultural characteristics of the Home and the essence of the innermost as a special super-value, specifies the traditional image of the innermost in living space related to the Home as the centre of existence and reveals the attributes of transformation of the innermost in the Home resulting from the processes which are characteristic of the modern age. The materials of the article can be useful for developing the scientific-methodological support of general and special courses, for conducting lessons in philosophical-cultural disciplines and for usage for designing and modeling the living environment.

AB  - Various studies have promoted instruction in the history and philosophy of science (HPS) in science classes, but the best way of putting this perspective into practice remains undetermined. To contribute to this issue, we developed a pedagogical project in some high schools in Brazil that aimed to present science content using an historical-philosophical approach focusing on the HPS from a social perspective. The content was developed broadly, highlighting the dialogues between science and the cultures in which scientific knowledge was accumulated. The results of the first stage of project implementation show that some strategies efficiently encouraged student discussion about science using an historical-philosophical approach. One successful strategy was the use of artistic material, such as movies and plays. The creative language and images in these elements allowed teachers to broaden historical-philosophical discussions without compromising science content. This project shows that a social approach to the HPS stimulates interdisciplinary discussions in science classes, enabling students to reflect on the nature of science.

AB  - Computer Science is a rich field with many growing application areas, such as Health Information Systems. What we suggest here is that multi-disciplinary threads can be introduced to supplement, enhance, and strengthen the primary area of study in a course. We call these supplementary materials "threads," because they are executed alongside the material presented in the course, reinforcing and augmenting it but not replacing it. Many studies have been performed on how making a topic more meaningful and relevant to students can improve their outcomes. Integrating Health Information Systems into the Computer Science curriculum can achieve this. In this paper, we present a case study in which the development of a health system is integrated into a Database course. The results indicate that students enjoyed the course more, were more motivated to complete the course project, and were able to learn and apply the core course materials more readily.

AB  - Multidisciplinary cooperation in health care requires a solid knowledge in the basic sciences for a common ground of communication. In speech pathology, these fundamentals improve the accuracy of descriptive diagnoses and support the development of new therapeutic techniques and strategies. The aim of this study is to briefly discuss the benefits of hands-on education on laryngeal anatomy and voice physiology in Brazilian graduate programs in speech pathology, as well as to describe a simple prototype that can be used as a useful educational tool for this purpose. The laryngeal anatomic support device was designed to provide a vertical frame to hold human or mammalian larynges with no preservation treatment, with the goal of allowing good visualization of the vocal folds during artificial phonation. The device was designed to provide the user the ability to manipulate the soft and cartilaginous structures of the larynx with near-natural biomechanical properties. The description of the project is detailed to allow the reproduction of this simple and inexpensive device. It may be used as an experimental feature in a variety of settings, from high-school programs to experimental research methods, and may suit a wide array of different educational models.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to understand one case of undergraduate inquiry-based instruction through the words and actions of students and instructors. The data sources included fieldnotes from 16 of 29 classes, two sets of student and instructor interviews (beginning and end of the semester), and a collection of artifacts, such as the laboratory manual, lecture handouts, and the course syllabus. The participants for this study included four faculty instructors and two purposively selected student groups, totaling eight students. We found the instructors' two course goals, (a) teaching students how scientists do science and (b) using an interdisciplinary approach to develop students' content knowledge of the big ideas in science, were consistent with our observations and the students' descriptions of their experience in the course. However, we observed, and the students also noted, an important feature of the course that the instructors did not describe as a course goal was its reliance on the social nature of learning. This telling case demonstrates that inquiry-based instruction is achievable in undergraduate science education. Implications are discussed for college science instructors interested in inquiry teaching.

AB  - Few systematic efforts have been reported to develop higher degree by research student skills for writing publishable articles in science and technology fields. There is a need to address this lack in the light of the current importance of publication to science research students and the high supervisor workload entailed in repeated draft correction, especially when students use English as an additional language. An interdisciplinary teaching approach to address this need has recently been developed featuring analysis frameworks from applied linguistics (AL) research, with successful outcomes in short, stand-alone workshops facilitated by an applied linguist teaching alone or in teams with scientists. Its use by a scientist alone has not previously been investigated, although scientists are well placed to address this development need. We investigate the suitability and effectiveness of this approach for use by a scientist to embed training, in the context of the first two years of operation of a school-level writing group programme, and identify features of the approach that align with participants' perceptions of benefit. Student response to the programme has been strongly positive, with increased confidence to write for publication and complete their degrees, and high activity towards publishing papers on their degree research. The presenter reports maintenance of his own publication output in spite of the time spent on this training, as a result of increased writing efficiency. Features of the approach that map to perceived benefit include its basis in AL frameworks for analysis of student-provided example papers; incorporation of relevant aspects of English usage and grammar in the frameworks; and inclusion of response to reviewer comments as an integral part of article writing.

AB  - The relevance of the study is conditioned by the modernization of engineering education aimed at specialists' training to solve engineering and economic problems effectively. The goal of the paper is to develop the technology of the innovative content's formation for engineering education. The leading method to the study of this problem is a method of quantization that allows compressing of the information to be studied and to create training modules and taxa. The study involved 430 teachers, 410 students who expressed their requirements for the content of engineering education, participated in the development and evaluation of training modules and taxa. Main results of the research consist in identifying of the stages for selection and structuring of the content for engineering education, requirements for the content (compliance with the invariant structure of professional activities; the system integrity of knowledge, abilities, skills, competences; taking into account of innovative educational, scientific and industrial developments) and defining of the rules for structuring (the compliance with professional functions; the identification of invariant and variant components; development of training modules; taxonomic representation of interdisciplinary relations; system integrity of structure-forming components). The significance of the findings is that the identified stages of selection and structuring of the content for engineering education provide extensive use of technology (controllability) of its formation; content requirements--selection of knowledge, abilities, skills, competences at the level of specific academic disciplines and their systematization; the proposed rules for structuring--integration of educational and vocational activities of students and research and teaching activities of teachers. The developed technology contributes to the relevance and accessibility of the content for engineering education, reliability of future engineers' vocational training, which is manifested in their readiness for multi-functional engineering and technical activities.

AB  - This book contains a compilation of papers presented at the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2017), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (W.I.A.R.S.). Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. The International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. The goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2017 received 581 submissions, from 55 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. The conference accepted for presentation 176 submissions (30% acceptance rate). The conference also includes a keynote presentation from an internationally distinguished researcher, Professor Lizbeth Goodman, Chair of Creative Technology Innovation and Professor of Inclusive Design for Learning at University College Dublin; Founder/Director of SMARTlab, Director of the Inclusive Design Research Centre of Ireland, Founder of The MAGIC Multimedia and Games Innovation Centre, Ireland, to whom we express our most gratitude. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. To develop the conference program we have chosen four main broad-ranging categories, which also covers different interest areas: (1) In TEACHERS AND STUDENTS: Teachers and Staff training and education; Educational quality and standards; Curriculum and Pedagogy; Vocational education and Counseling; Ubiquitous and lifelong learning; Training programs and professional guidance; Teaching and learning relationship; Student affairs (learning, experiences and diversity; Extra-curricular activities; Assessment and measurements in Education. (2) In PROJECTS AND TRENDS: Pedagogic innovations; Challenges and transformations in Education; Technology in teaching and learning; Distance Education and eLearning; Global and sustainable developments for Education; New learning and teaching models; Multicultural and (inter)cultural communications; Inclusive and Special Education; Rural and indigenous Education; Educational projects. (3) In TEACHING AND LEARNING: Educational foundations; Research and development methodologies; Early childhood and Primary Education; Secondary Education; Higher Education; Science and technology Education; Literacy, languages and Linguistics (TESL/TEFL); Health Education; Religious Education; Sports Education. (4) In ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES: Educational policy and leadership; Human Resources development; Educational environment; Business, Administration, and Management in Education; Economics in Education; Institutional accreditations and rankings; International Education and Exchange programs; Equity, social justice and social change; Ethics and values; Organizational learning and change, Corporate Education. This book contains the results of the research and developments conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to promote growth in research methods intimately related to teaching, learning and applications in Education nowadays. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, who will extend our view in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues, by sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. We would like to express thanks to all the authors and participants, the members of the academic scientific committee, and of course, to our organizing and administration team for making and putting this conference together. [This document contains the proceedings of END 2017: International Conference on Education and New Developments (Lisbon, Portugal, June 24-26, 2017).]

AB  - To maximize the contributions of nanotechnology to this society, at least 60 countries have put efforts into this field. In Taiwan, a government-funded K-12 Nanotechnology Programme was established to train K-12 teachers with adequate nanotechnology literacy to foster the next generation of Taiwanese people with sufficient knowledge in nanotechnology. In the present study, the Nanotechnology Attitude Scale for K-12 teachers (NAS-T) was developed to assess K-12 teachers' attitudes toward nanotechnology. The NAS-T included 23 Likert-scale items that can be grouped into three components: importance of nanotechnology, affective tendencies in science teaching, and behavioural tendencies to teach nanotechnology. A sample of 233 K-12 teachers who have participated in the K-12 Nanotechnology Programme was included in the present study to investigate the psychometric properties of the NAS-T. The exploratory factor analysis of this teacher sample suggested that the NAS-T was a three-factor model that explained 64.11% of the total variances. This model was also confirmed by the confirmatory factor analysis to validate the factor structure of the NAS-T. The Cronbach's alpha values of three NAS-T subscales ranged from 0.89 to 0.95. Moderate to strong correlations among teachers' NAS-T domain scores, self-perception of own nanoscience knowledge, and their science-teaching efficacy demonstrated good convergent validity of the NAS-T. As a whole, psychometric properties of the NAS-T indicated that this instrument is an effective instrument for assessing K-12 teachers' attitudes toward nanotechnology. The NAS-T will serve as a valuable tool to evaluate teachers' attitude changes after participating in the K-12 Nanotechnology Programme. (Contains 4 tables, 2 figures and 2 notes.)

AB  - Students in an interdisciplinary undergraduate introductory course were required to complete a group video project focused on nutrition and healthy eating. A mixed-methods approach to data collection involved observing and rating video footage of group work sessions and individual and focus group interviews. These data were analyzed and used to evaluate the effectiveness of the assignment in light of two student learning outcomes and two student development outcomes at the University of Minnesota. Positive results support the continued inclusion of the project within the course, and recommendthe assignment to other programs as a viable means of promoting both content learning and affective behavioral objectives.

AB  - We conducted a literature review of using educational technology in biology learning from 2001 to 2010. A total of 36 empirical articles were included for review. Based upon the content analyses of these studies, such as technologies utilized, student sample, biological topics involved, the research purpose, and methodology, the following observations were revealed. Among the different types of technologies, the majority of studies utilized simulations or visualization tools. Genetics and molecular biology were the most popular biological topics. Most studies examined students' conceptual outcomes, fewer studies examined affective outcomes, and a few studies examined higher-order skills. Also a small number of studies observed students' learning processes. Beyond simply the comparison for traditional teaching versus technology-assisted learning, some studies emphasized comparing different technologies or different representations. This review also suggested some future research directions. For example, more studies should use technologies for interdisciplinary training and for fostering problem-solving skills.

AB  - Teacher training on environmental education (EE) is a key element of promoting the restoration of ecological systems and insuring inclusive and equitable human development. Science and biology teachers play a significant role in favoring EE at Brazilian schools. This study investigates the presence of EE in the curriculum and aims to interpret the meanings of EE expressed in the discourse of students who are training to be biology teachers at a Brazilian public university, considering recent, related education legislation. The theoretical and methodological framework of French Discourse Analysis was adopted to identify social, political, and cultural influences expressed in the students' discourse. The discourse data comprised responses from voluntary undergraduate students to a semi-structured questionnaire. Most of the study participants claimed to have had contact with EE in their tertiary education and revealed multiple perceptions regarding this theme. The majority of the discourses indicated that EE meanings are restricted to conservation or preservation, and some indicated confusion regarding the purposes of both EE and ecology disciplines. There was little data indicating an association between EE and socioeconomic issues, which would be expected in terms of the more encompassing and interdisciplinary approaches recommended by legislation. The curricular matrix of this undergraduate course showed a predominance of hours devoted to courses that discuss the environment from the biological perspective in contrast to a small number of courses that discuss and promote EE from other perspectives. In addition, undergraduate students claimed that they had little contact with recent EE legislation. This scenario, reinforced by the naturalistic foundation discourse of EE in Brazil, probably affects the constitution of the discursive memories of these students, their discourses, and their future pedagogical practice. Recommendations are made in order to foster the development of citizenship at schools and to prevent the silencing of issues such as the conflicts and risks associated with environmental problems.

AB  - Biology in Context ("bik") is a project that aims to improve biology teaching in lower secondary schools in Germany. Based on a theoretical framework derived from the National Educational Standards, four competence areas should be fostered in biology education: subject knowledge; inquiry acquisition; subject-related communication; and valuing and decision making. Therefore, science education researchers and teachers work together in learning communities to transform theoretical competence models in teaching and learning practice using authentic contexts. Funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and the participating federal states, such learning communities were established. The accompanying formative evaluation research focuses on teachers' professional learning by analysing their attitudes, intentions and behaviour in implementing the "bik" project. The methodology involved questionnaires and structured interviews with teachers, science education researchers and coordinators in the initial phase, after one year of working together and finally at the completion of the "bik" project. The data show that the learning communities have inspired and supported the participating biology teachers to change their teaching towards a more competence-oriented and student-based teaching. The continuing study/work will now focus especially on interdisciplinary working in natural science context projects and in the development of diagnostic tasks to foster different biological competences.

AB  - Public and professional concern about health care quality, safety and efficiency is growing. Continuing education, knowledge translation, patient safety and quality improvement have made concerted efforts to address these issues. However, a coordinated and integrated effort across these domains is lacking. This article explores and discusses the similarities and differences amongst the four domains in relation to their missions, stakeholders, methods, and limitations. This paper highlights the potential for a more integrated and collaborative partnership to promote networking and information sharing amongst the four domains. This potential rests on the premise that an integrated approach may result in the development and implementation of more holistic and effective interdisciplinary interventions. In conclusion, an outline of current research that is informed by the preliminary findings in this paper is also briefly discussed. The research concerns a comprehensive mapping of the relationships between the domains to gain an understanding of potential dissonances between how the domains represent themselves, their work and the work of their "partner" domains.

AB  - This article explores connections between interprofessional education (IPE) models and the design of learning spaces for undergraduate and graduate education in the anatomical sciences and other professional preparation. The authors argue that for IPE models to be successful and sustained they must be embodied in the environment in which interprofessional learning occurs. To elaborate these arguments, two exemplar tertiary education facilities are discussed: the Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney for science education and research, and Victoria University's Interprofessional Clinic in Wyndham for undergraduate IPE in health care. Backed by well-conceived curriculum and pedagogical models, the architectures of these facilities embody the educational visions, methods, and practices they were designed to support. Subsequently, the article discusses the spatial implications of curriculum and pedagogical change in the teaching of the anatomical sciences and explores how architecture might further the development of IPE models in the field. In conclusion, it is argued that learning spaces should be designed and developed (socially) with the expressed intention of supporting collaborative IPE models in health education settings, including those in the anatomical sciences.

AB  - WIKIed Biology is a National Science Foundation Transforming Undergraduate Education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics interdisciplinary project in which the authors developed and implemented a model for student centered, inquiry-driven instruction using Web 2.0 technologies to increase inquiry and conceptual understanding in biology. Web 2.0 applications enhance collaboration among users to find, create, manipulate, and disseminate information and can form a relevant connection between real-world science and students' learning of content. Students use Web 2.0 technologies in their daily lives; however, there is little empirical research into its impact on student learning. This paper describes a course in which Web 2.0 tools (del.i.cious, CiteULike, and Google docs and sites) were used to support the teaching--learning process, including the use of tagging and social bookmarking, academic resource management, and website collaboration and design. Students reported gains in understanding of the relationship between the science process, Web 2.0 technologies, and scientific communication, as well as skill in evaluating validity of sources from the internet. Critical Thinking Assessment Tests supported these data.

AB  - Wikipedia is a web-based, free-content encyclopedia that is openly editable and, thus, provides a unique platform for collaborations. Wikipedia projects are increasingly being integrated into upper-level courses across the country to explore advanced concepts, communicate science, and provide high-quality information to the public. Here we outline a project intended to reinforce and communicate concepts of risk assessment as it was implemented in a multidisciplinary graduate course and, based on observations from the instructors and results from a post-project reflection survey and exit-interview, we evaluated how to better enable student learning in future Wikipedia projects. A networked Wikipedia project was introduced to a graduate-level course in human and environmental safety as an alternative to traditional team projects. Students independently authored Wikipedia entries and then collaborated in editing the result prior to publication to the World Wide Web. Project outcomes indicated general success by the students in developing high quality content, but there is a need to improve the background and supporting materials provided to students to better enable their use of Wikipedia writing and editing tools. There was also opportunity to improve quality of the students' work product by emphasizing the major course concepts that should be applied in the project and by more clearly addressing common questions that relate to the Wikipedia "process." Student learning curves and computer literacy dictated the pace at which the project moved forward; so for the less computer literate students, effort tended to skew toward learning the tool rather than applying course concepts.

AB  - An empirical study on 12th-grade students' engagement on a global warming debate as a citizens' conference is reported. Within the design-based research methodology, an interdisciplinary teaching sequence integrating an initiation to non-violent communication was developed. Students' debates were analyzed according to three dimensions: communication, argumentation, and knowledge. Students regulated their oral contributions to the debate by identifying judgments in their discussions. Rhetorical processes developed by students were mainly related to the identity of debate protagonists with interest attributions, authority, and positions. Students' arguments also relied on empirical data. The students' knowledge focused on energy choices, economic, political, and science development issues. Implications for socioscientific issues integration in class are discussed.

AB  - This article begins with clarification of any confusion one might have as to what is meant by Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education. The author writes that the acronym STEM was originally used in a political context to call attention to the demands of the future workforce in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics-related professions. At that time STEM meant a set of independent disciplines, each of which was abbreviated by one character. Later, educators saw this as a challenge to seek ways of developing integrated STEM Education, in which elements from the four individual disciplines could be used in combination. Currently, the acronym iSTEM (integrated STEM) is often used to distinguish from the previous meaning of STEM. The article goes on to explore the ambivalence of STEM education in the the Netherlands, which is one of the countries in which Technology Education struggles. Technology Education was introduced there as a separate subject in lower secondary education in 1993. Since 2004, schools there have had the freedom either to keep Technology Education as a separate subject or to integrate it with Science Education. The merger of Science and Technology, which can be seen as a movement towards integrated STEM Education in some schools, particularly those in which there was a strong Technology Education program, produced an unexpected positive effect. Suddenly, Technology Education was in the same realm as the important subject, Science, rather than in the realm of making crafts. Altogether, the case of the Netherlands offers experiences on the international stage which show the ambivalence of iSTEM for the position of Technology Education in the curriculum. There are examples in which iSTEM almost leads to the death of Technology Education and, at the same time, there are other examples that are very promising because they give prominent attention to Design and Technology in integrated projects. A determining factor is the type of teachers involved (a combination of Science and Technology teachers in the successful cases and mono-disciplinary teaching in the failed cases). The author concludes by advancing the idea that the experiences in the Netherlands show that it is possible to realise integrated STEM education, but only when this is done in cooperation between science, technology, and math teachers.

AB  - Background: The Framework for K-12 Science Education (NRC, 2012) and Next Generation Science Standards ([NGSS] NGSS Lead States, 2013) emphasize that all students from the earliest grades onward must have the opportunity to learn and actively participate in authentic science. In K-12 science instruction, this means that students should have the opportunity to learn by applying the three dimensions of science and engineering practices, disciplinary core ideas, and crosscutting concepts in the context of reasoning about phenomena and problem solving. Yet, the current reality is there is a lack of emphasis on teaching science in the early elementary grades and the quality of what is being taught varies tremendously, both in content and quality (NAS, 2022). Recently, NGSS-designed instructional materials for the elementary grades have become available to school districts, creating an opportunity for conducting evidence-based research on the efficacy of NGSS designed curricula. We conducted a study of an integrated science and literacy curriculum (ISLC) for first grade classrooms that was initially developed with funding from IES. The curriculum, now a part of the commercially available K-5 Amplify Science program, was designed to support integrated science, language, and literacy learning, consistent with the NGSS. We evaluated the efficacy of ISLC for improving first grade students' learning in relation to NGSS performance expectations and to Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy. Two primary research questions motivated this paper: (1) What is the impact of ISLC and accompanying professional learning on students' science and literacy learning? and (2) Does the impact of ISLC on learning vary for students with different prior achievement or other policy-relevant characteristics? Setting and Participants: The study was conducted in 40 ethnically and culturally diverse elementary schools across three districts in California, involving 82 first-grade teachers and 2035 students. One treatment school dropped from the study before the student outcome learning outcome assessments were administered. Each district was committed to providing regular science instruction in the early elementary grades. Table 1 shows the composition of the analytic student sample. Seventy percent of students receive free-or-reduced price lunch (FRPL) and 74 percent identify as Hispanic. Table 1 also shows the results of baseline equivalence tests for the analytic sample. Groups were equivalent at baseline on prior reading proficiency (Hedge g = 0.02) with some minor differences in ethnic composition. Intervention: The ISLC materials consist of three units, each focused on one of three science domains: life, physical, and Earth and space science. Each unit consists of 22 45-minute lessons that can be taught within a 6-8 week period. The curriculum adopts a model of literacy and science integration that embraces a reciprocal relationship: that reading, writing, and language can be employed to promote the learning of science; and that students can make substantial progress in literacy development when reading, writing, and language are used to support science learning. The curriculum includes 3 professional learning (PL) sessions (a total of 4 days) distributed across the school year and timed to prepare teachers to teach each unit. Research Design: Schools were randomly assigned within district to either implement ISLC materials (treatment) or their business as usual materials (control) in their first-grade classrooms. Prior to assignment, schools were matched on enrollment size, percent minority and percent economically disadvantaged students. Teachers in the control group were asked to teach with their regular curriculum materials and participate in typical science professional learning provided by their districts. Control teachers were accountable to the same NGSS performance expectations and coverage of the same Grade 1 science topics as treatment teachers. Outcome Measures: The outcome measures included two standardized Iowa Assessments for Grade 1 Reading and Science and two study-developed NGSS-aligned assessments of science learning and science vocabulary-in-use. All assessments were administered on paper by teachers in the spring towards the end of the school year. Spanish-versions of the assessments were administered by teachers when all their instruction was in Spanish. Further details on the study-developed assessments are included in the Appendix. Data Analysis: We investigated the effect of ISLC on student learning and possible moderators using a multilevel linear regression model (students within schools). Student-level covariates included prior reading scores from fall assessments, gender, English-learner (EL), FRPL and Individualized Education Plan (IEP) status, and ethnicity. At the school-level, the randomization block was the covariate. Results and Discussion: Table 2 shows the results of the impact analysis. We found statistically significantly positive effects of the ISLC curriculum on the study-developed science learning assessment (Hedges g = +0.24) and the science vocabulary-in-use assessment (Hedges g = +0.46). We also found a small positive effect (Hedges g = +0.09) on the science component of the standardized Iowa assessment. This result was somewhat expected given that the Iowa science assessment was not designed for the NGSS and thus less likely to be instructionally sensitive to the use of an NGSS-designed curriculum. Finally, we found no difference between conditions on the standardized Iowa reading assessment. This is an intriguing result. We believe the null effect result for the Iowa reading assessment may be evidence that teachers can teach considerably more science in the early grades using ISLC without concern that students' reading scores will be negatively impacted. We are currently investigating the differences in time spent in science instruction between conditions. None of the effects on learning varied by prior achievement, ethnicity, or FRPL, IEP, or EL status. Conclusions: The NGSS vision for learning requires changes in how science curriculum and instruction are conceptualized, supported, and implemented (Penuel et al., 2015). The results of this study shows promising evidence that curriculum materials designed for the early grades to support NGSS teaching and learning can improve student acquisition of ambitious science skills and science vocabulary usage. As other new-NGSS designed materials become more widely used across geographic regions and with varying student populations, additional studies at larger scale will be needed so that we can further build the evidence base for the uptake of science in the elementary grades.

AB  - This article focuses on two early attempts at bridging neuroscience and education, made by Henry Herbert Donaldson (1857-1938), a neurologist, and Reuben Post Halleck (1859-1936), an educator. Their works, respectively entitled "The Growth of the Brain: A Study of the Nervous System in Relation to Education" (1895) and "The Education of the Central Nervous System: A Study of Foundations, Especially of Sensory and Motor Training" (1896), witness early attempts at opening up paths for the application of neurobiological findings to education. We provide an expose of select points from their monographs; published only 1 year apart, both texts constitute significant testimonies of that "Zeitgeist". They shed light on contemporary discussions about gender, neuroplasticity, critical periods, nature and nurture, and sleep/awake rhythms and provide a much needed perspective on the difficulties of founding the new inter- and transdisciplinary field of neuroeducation.

AB  - Before 1950, history of science did not exist as an independent academic branch, but was instead pursued by practitioners across various humanities and scientific disciplines. After professionalization, traces of its prehistory as a cross-disciplinary area of interest bound to an interdisciplinary, educational philosophy have remained. This essay outlines the development of history of science as an interdisciplinary academic field, and argues that it constitutes an obvious choice for inclusion in an interdisciplinary academic program,  provided faculty and administrators learn how best to manage its advantages and pitfalls.

AB  - As the healthcare climate shifts toward increased interdisciplinary patient care, it is essential that students become accomplished at group problem solving and develop positive attitudes toward teamwork. Team-based learning (TBL) has become a popular approach to medical education because of its ability to promote active learning, problem-solving skills, communication, and teamwork. However, its documented use in the laboratory setting and physical therapy education is limited. We used TBL as a substitute for one-third of cadaveric dissections in the gross anatomy laboratories at two Doctor of Physical Therapy programs to study its effect on both students' perceptions and academic performance. We surveyed students at the beginning and completion of their anatomy course as well as students who had previously completed a traditional anatomy course to measure the impact of TBL on students' perceptions of teamwork. We found that the inclusion of TBL in the anatomy laboratory improves students' attitudes toward working with peers (P?<?0.01). Non-TBL students had significantly lower attitudes toward teamwork (P?<?0.01). Comparison of academic performance between TBL and non-TBL students revealed that students who participated in TBL scored significantly higher on their first anatomy practical examination and on their head/neck written examination (P?<?0.001). When asked to rate their role in a team, a 10.5% increase in the mean rank score for Problem Solver resulted after the completion of the TBL-based anatomy course. Our data indicate that TBL is an effective supplement to cadaveric dissection in the laboratory portion of gross anatomy, improving both students' grades and perceptions of teamwork.

AB  - The world faces a number of complex challenges that are sometimes referred to as "wicked problems." Universities have been relatively poor at preparing graduates for such challenges, yet it will be the future professionals who need to tackle the problems. This essay looks at two related projects that have attempted to advance the skills training of graduates for a complex world, in the context of educating engineers and scientists in sustainable development. A Delphi study conducted in the UK suggested that systemic, student-centred approaches were vital to the appropriate development of undergraduates to become engineers with skills in sustainable development. A pilot project sponsored by the UK Royal Academy of Engineering developed an inter-disciplinary course unit, using student-centred principles, to embed the principles of sustainable development, in its broadest sense, in the curricula of engineers and scientists. The essay includes an evaluation of this approach.

AB  - "BIO2010" put forth the goal of improving the mathematical educational background of biology students. The analysis and interpretation of microarray high-dimensional data can be very challenging and is best done by a statistician and a biologist working and teaching in a collaborative manner. We set up such a collaboration and designed a course on microarray data analysis. We started using Genome Consortium for Active Teaching (GCAT) materials and Microarray Genome and Clustering Tool software and added R statistical software along with Bioconductor packages. In response to student feedback, one microarray data set was fully analyzed in class, starting from preprocessing to gene discovery to pathway analysis using the latter software. A class project was to conduct a similar analysis where students analyzed their own data or data from a published journal paper. This exercise showed the impact that filtering, preprocessing, and different normalization methods had on gene inclusion in the final data set. We conclude that this course achieved its goals to equip students with skills to analyze data from a microarray experiment. We offer our insight about collaborative teaching as well as how other faculty might design and implement a similar interdisciplinary course. (Contains 5 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - Healthcare information technology is at a crossroads today. As legacy data systems converge with bleeding edge technologies, the technology environments of today's hospitals and clinics are evolving rapidly, producing new care delivery models. As a result, we need to reassess how information technology education is meeting the needs of healthcare practitioners and institutions. The recent push to adopt Health Information Technology (HIT) with financial incentives and penalties attached was a bold move, but establishing policies is easier to pen than implement. The challenge faced by many healthcare organizations is the lack of technical and organizational infrastructure, as well as skilled man power. This special issue seeks to bring new approaches to the IT classroom, particularly with HIT curriculum, training, and education. Students entering the workforce or completing professional programs will have more career options with an understanding of how to leverage enabling technologies. Those in a healthcare management and leadership capacities will also benefit from this special edition as each of the articles presented address strategic level issues and the need for IT leadership in the planning and implementation of enterprise level systems, to ensure the safety, privacy and security off all patients are protected. The authors of this special issue offer interdisciplinary perspectives on key topics shaping HIT around the world. As members of academia, curriculum is at the heart of the matter and our authors offer justification and case studies on areas where academia needs to continue its growth to serve the healthcare industry.

AB  - Despite the long history of the study of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), two facts remain obvious. First, there are almost as many conceptions regarding the definition of PCK as there are researchers interested in it. Second, it is largely unclear which methods enable teacher educators to best prepare teacher candidates to use PCK. Recently, two themes have emerged strongly as mechanisms for helping teacher candidates become more accomplished practitioners. These two ideas, reflective practice and teacher as researcher, can be seen in a variety of teacher preparation programs. However, prevailing systems for preparing and accrediting teachers seem to have a strong enough hold over the process that completely different approaches to preparation, centered on these ideas, may have difficulty getting started. The authors offer a working model of a transferable teacher preparation program that is founded upon the concepts of reflective practitioner and teacher as researcher. They offer a study of the Graduate Program in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education (GMST) at their school as an example of one way in which the ideas can be used to reorganize teacher preparation programs with the explicit goal of preparing teachers to become reflective practitioners and creating teachers as researchers. The master's curriculum of GMST program is designed and organized around putting into practice educational theory and research relating to the ways that students learn mathematics, science, and technology. The mission of the program is to prepare teachers of grades 1-12 by endowing them with a strong background in the content of mathematics, science, and technology, as well as understanding of the particular needs of diverse learners with respect to teaching mathematics, science, and technology. The authors discuss the GMST program and its historical development.

AB  - Objectives: Computer Science (CS) education has become increasingly prevalent in elementary schools because of multiple rationales, such as the importance of computational literacy and the growing demand for CS-related workforce preparation. As elementary CS standards continue to be adopted by many states, more examples and voices from the field may help educators understand what effective computational thinking (CT)/CS integration looks like in practice. Method: We employed a descriptive qualitative approach to study eight award-winning K-8 CS teachers and aimed to answer three research questions: (1) What were elementary CS teachers' rationales for CT/CS integration? (2) How do elementary CS teachers integrate CT/CS into their classroom practices? (3) What are the needs of CS teachers for meaningful CT/CS integration in elementary schools? Data were collected through interviews, a questionnaire, and artifacts and analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings: Our findings of elementary CS teachers' rationales for CT/CS integration encompassed its essential nature as a literacy skill, its potential to promote equity in education, and its alignment with standards across various disciplines. To support CT/CS integration at the elementary level, CS teachers described important aspects with examples from their instructional practices: (a) Real-world applications; (b) hands-on activities; (c) strategies to scaffold and guide student learning; (d) collaboration with classroom teachers; and (e) support from professional development (PD). Conclusion: The study results shared CS teachers' voices from practice and shed light on the urgent need for more support and PD opportunities for both homeroom teachers and CS teachers in elementary schools, as well as the crucial need for multiple levels of support within K-12 school systems. Continuous efforts in creating systematic and sustainable PD plans and supporting collaborative professional communities for teachers within the instructional context are a must to help prepare our elementary students with the essential CS knowledge and skills they need to thrive in this technology-rich society.

AB  - The University of Texas at Austin has developed an upper-division undergraduate laboratory called "NANOLAB" to introduce undergraduate science and engineering students to nanoscale science and engineering (NSE) concepts. The NANOLAB is not a stand-alone course offered by a specific department, but rather a laboratory station--or hub--that interfaces with existing "traditional" laboratory courses across both the Colleges of Engineering and Natural Sciences. The chemical engineering department played a central role in developing the NANOLAB, which is designed to provide close to 1,000 undergraduate students per year with a hands-on introduction to NSE fundamentals.

AB  - We report on a two-year NSF-funded project to strengthen connections among science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. One component of this project was to produce some initial data on the effectiveness of Interdisciplinary Lively Applications Projects (ILAPs) in teaching science and engineering undergraduates. ILAPs are interdisciplinary group problem solving projects, co-written by mathematics faculty and science/technology/engineering faculty. These small group projects are designed to foster student interest by being lively, real world applications of mathematics in science and engineering. ILAPs are intended to assist students in learning to communicate across disciplines and in developing problem-solving skills. We summarize our development and use of ILAPs in the calculus courses and, in particular, describe our assessment data and results on the effectiveness of ILAPs in learning and related results.

AB  - A collaborative of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and education faculty developed a STEM certificate aimed at elementary education majors. A four-phase process model was used to create and evaluate courses. The certificate is comprised of three interdisciplinary, team-taught, lab-based courses: Environmental Biology, Chemistry of Life, and Engineering in Your World. The biology and chemistry courses are inquiry based, whereas the engineering course is project based. Each of the courses is cotaught by a faculty member in STEM and a faculty member in education. The goal of the certificate is to improve elementary education majors' STEM competence and confidence. Initial assessment results showed significant gains in confidence and competence on the basis of knowledge test items. Curriculum continues to be refined on the basis of assessments and changing state and national education standards. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - The focus of this Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) project was on RNA secondary structure prediction by using a lattice walk approach. The lattice walk approach is a combinatorial and computational biology method used to enumerate possible secondary structures and predict RNA secondary structure from RNA sequences. The method uses discrete mathematical techniques and identifies specified base pairs as parameters. The goal of the REU was to introduce upper-level undergraduate students to the principles and challenges of interdisciplinary research in molecular biology and discrete mathematics. At the beginning of the project, students from the biology and mathematics departments of a mid-sized university received instruction on the role of secondary structure in the function of eukaryotic RNAs and RNA viruses, RNA related to combinatorics, and the National Center for Biotechnology Information resources. The student research projects focused on RNA secondary structure prediction on a regulatory region of the yellow fever virus RNA genome and on an untranslated region of an mRNA of a gene associated with the neurological disorder epilepsy. At the end of the project, the REU students gave poster and oral presentations, and they submitted written final project reports to the program director. The outcome of the REU was that the students gained transferable knowledge and skills in bioinformatics and an awareness of the applications of discrete mathematics to biological research problems.

AB  - The relevance of the research problem is determined by the current discrepancy between the requirements of society to quality of students' training--future specialists with higher education, on the one hand, and level of training received by graduates on the other hand. The tendency of the discrepancies noted is a consequence of the properties of the inertia of the educational process that gives it stability, but also hindering rapid response to the recent changes in the sphere of science, production, culture, industry and other spheres of life. The current controversy requires scientific correction and rethinking of the methodology of quality evaluation of the educational process. In this regard, priority attention in this article is devoted to justification of qualimetric grounds for the projecting and implementation of monitoring technologies in the educational process of the University. A leading research method is a simulation method allowing justification of monitoring technologies as qualimetric bases of educational process of the University and rethinking their valuable content in the students' training. The article presents the discourse of the concept "monitoring technology"; it reveals the essence, structure and content of qualimetric grounds of the monitoring technologies in the educational process of the University; on the basis of the study's results conducted the elective interdisciplinary course "Qualimetric grounds of monitoring technologies" is justified. Productivity of its implementation is proven using the criteria: formation of knowledge of the content of studied course, of the experience in using the acquired knowledge in standard and non-standard situations in the educational process; the integrity of knowledge about the qualimetric basis of the monitoring technologies in the students' training; the students' readiness to be engaged professionally in any activity; formation of competences of the culture of mental labor in accordance with the personal position of the student in self-organization and self-transformation; the personal creativity of the student--future specialist, relevant to qualimetric objectives of the monitoring technology. The paper can be useful to teachers, methodologists, managers of the universities.

AB  - Virtual environments can resolve many practical and pedagogical challenges within higher education. Economic considerations, accessibility issues, and safety concerns can all be somewhat alleviated by creating learning activities in a virtual space. Because of the removal of real-world physical limitations like gravity, durability and scope, virtual space allows for an expansion of possibilities and approaches to knowledge transfer and discovery learning and becomes an "environment for information" rich with collaborative possibilities. Experimentation and participation in conceptual as well as applied projects is encouraged for both students and instructors. One of these virtual environments, Second Life, was used in a cross-disciplinary project for the creation of a Marine Science virtual class environment as an assignment for design students at a major southwestern research university in the United States. This paper reports on the findings from a project that utilized Second Life as a medium for enhancing and extending design education using a process of interdisciplinary collaboration.

AB  - The so-called Greek Financial Crisis, which has been the object of close attention in the German media since the end of 2009, has caused a public debate on who should be held responsible for the decline of crisis-hit Greece, the common currency and the Eurozone. The media's enduring and controversial public discussion has lately been referred to as the "Greek bashing." When the crisis had spread much further in 2012 and also other countries suffered from high debt, economic stagnation and unemployment, the news coverage became more moderate. This project report highlights the role of medial discourses of difference and solidarity during the crisis. Therefore, we rely on an exemplary data-set that does not only take the development of the German media's tenor on the "Greek Crisis" into consideration, but also adds an international perspective in order to compare the medial treatment of different countries involved. The study methodologically focuses on the analysis of (metaphorical) language and grammatical structures in the news coverage of the German daily newspaper "BILD," the German magazine "SPIEGEL" as well as the international news magazines "Economist" (Great Britain) and "TIME" (USA). Therefore, the interdisciplinary approach of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) was used in order to produce insights into public discourses in sociopolitical contexts.

AB  - Environmental art education is growing in popularity in college and university programs as the arts begin to play a more prominent role in environmental and sustainability education. As this emerging field of study is an interdisciplinary endeavor that draws from the more established fields of visual art education and environmental education, environmental art education offers a means to increase the pool of potential learners to those in the arts and sciences, as well as diversify learning to ensure that it is memorable and authentic. This article describes two different approaches to the design of courses in this emerging field from the perspectives of both science and art educators, in hopes of providing direction on the development of curricula and pedagogy in environmental art education to other educators.

AB  - The underlying assumption to this paper is that learners' ability to appreciate the relevance of school science and its importance to socio-economic development of their communities to a large extent depends on the quality of instruction they receive from their teachers. A popular conundrum is that no country is greater than the calibre of its teachers. However, a sort of Mathew's principle of the "haves" having more and the "have-nots" losing even what they do have tends to hold. Hence, learners of well-trained teachers tend to outperform those of poorly trained teachers on most tasks. A vivid example here in South Africa is the usual wide chasm between the matriculation results of learners from the former well-resourced Model C schools and those (with few exceptions due to massive support) from the previously disadvantaged schools. In pursuit of relevance many African political leaders and policy makers have called on teacher training institutions to produce teachers who are capable of making school science relevant to learners' home environment. This paper reports an attempt that has been made to equip teachers in such a way that makes science accessible, interesting and complementary to learners' indigenous knowledge and life worlds in general.

AB  - Current trends in ecological research emphasize interdisciplinary approaches for assessing effects of present and predicted environmental changes. One such emerging interdisciplinary field is the discipline of ecohydrology, which studies the feedbacks and interactions between ecological and hydrological processes. However, interdisciplinary science, which includes ecohydrology and other fields, has not yet been effectively translated into many K-12 curricula. We adapted an ecohydrological research project, originally conducted at the Biosphere 2 research apparatus, for use in a middle school classroom. The experiment focuses on describing the effects of changes in landscape vegetation cover on the partitioning of evapotranspiration, the major component of the water budget, into plant transpiration and soil evaporation. The 1-week long experiment was conducted by Grade 6 students (n = 82) in classrooms in Oro Valley, AZ. Students completed pre- and post-experiment tests designed to assess their general understanding of the components of evapotranspiration as well as the scientific procedures that can be used to differentiate them. Our results show significant improvement between the pre- and post-experiment evaluations on the understanding of the water cycle concepts, particularly those associated with evapotranspiration. This improvement illustrates how the incorporation of experimental knowledge can constitute a key instrument to successful delivery of scientific information in the classroom. We discuss how current scientific research can be effectively incorporated into the science curriculum, which in turn can be used as an instrumental tool to produce scientifically relevant data.

AB  - This paper describes a web-based collaborative project called "A Dance with the Butterflies" that applied the brain-based research of the Center for Applied Special Technologies (CAST) and principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to Pre-K-4 science curriculum. Learning experiences were designed for students to invoke the Recognition, Strategic, and Affective neural networks for learning identified in the CAST research. Instruction was based on the Science Education content standard that all students should develop an understanding of the characteristics, life cycles, and environments of living organisms. Teachers designed interdisciplinary projects for students with the metamorphosis of the butterfly as the theme the unit. Participants from nine states and four countries learned about UDL to transform teaching and to collaborate through a blog that supported their learning. They shared new technology applications for use in their projects. The learning that occurred and the excitement to use technology for learning clearly demonstrate the power of the UDL framework for increasing engagement and understanding by all learners.

AB  - Despite the ubiquity and critical importance of science and technology in international affairs, their role receives insufficient attention in traditional international relations curricula. There is little literature on how the relations between science, technology, economics, politics, law and culture should be taught in an international context. Since it is impossible even for scientists to master all the branches of natural science and engineering that affect public policy, the learning goals of students whose primary training is in the social sciences should be to get some grounding in the natural sciences or engineering, to master basic policy skills, to understand the basic concepts that link science and technology to their broader context, and to gain a respect for the scientific and technological dimensions of the broader issues they are addressing. They also need to cultivate a fearless determination to master what they need to know in order to address policy issues, an open-minded but skeptical attitude towards the views of dueling experts, regardless of whether they agree with their politics, and (for American students) a world-view that goes beyond a strictly U.S. perspective on international events. The Georgetown University program in Science, Technology and International Affairs (STIA) is a unique, multi-disciplinary undergraduate liberal arts program that embodies this approach and could be an example that other institutions of higher learning might adapt to their own requirements.

AB  - With the rising popularity of digital games, a growing number of universities are developing programmes in various areas of digital design and interactive media to meet the needs for game-related courses. Faculty of this emerging field are grappling with the complexity of developing curricula which integrate art, design and technology and of finding methods of integrating students from these diverse fields. The purpose of this article is to present a case study of an interdisciplinary undergraduate course in game design and to highlight some of the unforeseen challenges and issues that arose when attempting to integrate diverse students from various art, design and media fields with students from computer science. Specifically, this article addresses issues of (a) power, (b) conflict and (c) gender that arose among students during the development of a student-created game.

AB  - This study investigates critical thinking in a Physical Geography course and illustrates how students can understand physical geography in the context of their world. As a general education science course, most students are in non-science disciplines and feel disconnected from the material. By using exercises that challenge learning and concept associations, they apply new information into their lives to make the material meaningful and memorable. As an introductory survey course, students are introduced to an array of subject matter. They find it difficult to link concepts of Earth systems together. By using thought sessions and formatted worksheets, students can reflect on one system and how it impacts another system. Students choose thought sessions from categories (political/economic, analytical/scientific, philosophical/artistic, technological), supporting an interdisciplinary approach.

AB  - Librarians have traditionally taught information literacy skills to science graduate students in separate courses dedicated to information-seeking, during assignment(s)-based library sessions for other courses, or through workshops. There is little mention in the professional literature of teaching graduate students within their research groups. This is certainly an alternative to consider--especially for smaller science graduate programs where the more traditional means of reaching graduate students are less likely. This article discusses a collaborative effort between a Chemistry professor and Physical Sciences Librarian at Rutgers University-Newark to design a mini-course for a research group. With the amount of customization possible when working with research groups, this option may even become increasingly significant due to the growing importance of interdisciplinary research.

AB  - The problems that we face in our ever-changing, increasingly global society are multidisciplinary, and many require the integration of multiple science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) concepts to solve them. National calls for improvement of STEM education in the United States are driving changes in policy, particularly in academic standards. Research on STEM integration in K-12 classrooms has not kept pace with the sweeping policy changes in STEM education. This study addresses the need for research to explore the translation of broad, national-level policy statements regarding STEM education and integration to state-level policies and implementation in K-12 classrooms. An interpretive multicase study design was employed to conduct an in-depth investigation of secondary STEM teachers' implementation of STEM integration in their classrooms during a yearlong professional development program. The interpretive approach was used because it provides holistic descriptions and explanations for the particular phenomenon, in this case STEM integration. The results of this study demonstrate the possibilities of policies that use state standards documents as a mechanism to integrate engineering into science standards. Our cases suggest that STEM integration can be implemented most successfully when mathematics and science teachers work together both in a single classroom (co-teaching) and in multiple classrooms (content teaching--common theme).

AB  - In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, mathematicians and physical philosophers managed to study, via mathematics, various physical systems of the sublunar world through idealized and simplified models of these systems, constructed with the help of geometry. By analyzing these models, they were able to formulate new concepts, laws and theories of physics and then through models again, to apply these concepts and theories to new physical phenomena and check the results by means of experiment. Students' difficulties with the mathematics of high school physics are well known. Science education research attributes them to inadequately deep understanding of mathematics and mainly to inadequate understanding of the meaning of symbolic mathematical expressions. There seem to be, however, more causes of these difficulties. One of them, not independent from the previous ones, is the complex meaning of the algebraic concepts used in school physics (e.g. variables, parameters, functions), as well as the complexities added by physics itself (e.g. that equations' symbols represent magnitudes with empirical meaning and units instead of pure numbers). Another source of difficulties is that the theories and laws of physics are often applied, via mathematics, to simplified, and idealized physical models of the world and not to the world itself. This concerns not only the applications of basic theories but also all authentic end-of-the-chapter problems. Hence, students have to understand and participate in a complex interplay between physics concepts and theories, physical and mathematical models, and the real world, often without being aware that they are working with models and not directly with the real world.

AB  - Engineering graduates are expected to possess various competencies categorised into hard and soft skills. The hard skills are acquired through specific coursework, but the soft skills are often treated perfunctorily. Global Engineering Teams (GET) is a programme that promotes project-oriented tasks in virtual student teams working in collaboration with industry partners. Teamwork is a major success factor for GET as students always work in groups of varying sizes. A questionnaire-based survey of the 2008 cohort of GET students was conducted to assess teamwork, communication and conflict resolution among group members. The results confirmed that deliverables are readily achieved in teams and communication was open. A challenge of using virtual teams is the availability of high-speed Internet access. The GET programme shows that it is possible to deliver engineering design and manufacturing via industry/university collaboration. The programme also facilitates multidisciplinary teamwork at an international level. (Contains 2 tables and 7 figures.)

AB  - The reconstruction of ancient atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations is essential to understanding the history of the Earth and life. It is also an important guide to identifying the sensitivity of the Earth system to this greenhouse gas and, therefore, constraining its future impact on climate. However, determining the concentration of CO[subscript 2] in ancient atmospheres is a challenging endeavour requiring the application of state-of-the-art analytical chemistry to geological materials, underpinned by an understanding of photosynthesis and biochemistry. It is truly an interdisciplinary challenge. (Contains 5 figures and 1 box.)

AB  - This book focuses on the impact of sustained and evolving collaborations, showcasing research and scholarship in a faculty group--consisting of 28 professors from five regional universities--meeting and supporting each other since 2002. Originally an innovation introduced by Cheryl J. Craig and funded by a reform movement, the Faculty Academy continues to flourish in the fourth largest city in America long after the reform initiative abandoned its charge. Contributors to this volume represent all stages of careers, include all races and genders, and write from a multiplicity of disciplinary stances (literacy, mathematics, science, social education, multiculturalism, English as a Second Language, accountability, etc.). In addition to fascinatingly diverse perspectives on teacher education, the authors also investigate issues related to career trajectories--including experiences of vulnerability. The volume illuminates how the Faculty Academy works as a dynamic academic and social bond: not only as a glue that binds members in community, but also in rigorous intellectual commitments that fuel their collective knowing and advance their careers while providing leadership, mentorship, and modelling in up-close and timely ways.

AB  - At Education Development Center, the authors developed professional learning for teachers that reflects the vision of the "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS") and makes explicit connections between science and language. In the authors' recent project, Literacy and Academic Success for English Learners through Science (LASErS) they worked with preK, Kindergarten, and Grade 1 teachers in an urban district in which approximately 50 percent of students are DLLs. In this article, the authors focus on their work with Grade 1 teachers who participated in a Living Things module. This module consisted of four full-day face-to-face instructional sessions--designed to build teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) in life science and support their integrated science and language teaching with a focus on DLLs.

AB  - Three years after Japan integrated "programming" into all elementary school subjects, questions remain on how policy is being put into practice in arts education. This article examines the current state of "programming" - activities addressing a local version of computational thinking - in music, with a focus on Japan's pending challenges. First, an analysis of 23 activity reports sheds light on the main features of implementation efforts conducted by elementary school teachers from all over the country. Notably, compliance with official guidelines seems to have been prioritized over subject-specific contents, and, in some cases, the mere use of digital technologies in the classroom appears to be more relevant than programming and music-making goals. Following that, two key stakeholders - Japanese professionals engaged in planning and implementing "programming" in music in elementary schools - provide insights on its present state and future prospects through an open questionnaire. Their often-contrasting answers include perspectives on learning goals, teachers' skills and assessment, as well as their expectations and concerns. A number of unresolved issues and tensions persist regarding how subject contents and "programming" should be balanced. Given this situation, final remarks address how music-centered, postdigital views of "programming" may inform future initiatives in the intersection of computing science and music education.

AB  - Various science education researchers believe that science tuition should include some discussion about how science has developed over time. Therefore, deliberations about the nature of science should be integrated in the science curriculum. Many researchers argue that teaching the history of science is a good way to place the nature of science in science classes. This paper contributes to this debate and argues the importance of having young students study the birth of modern science. Such study could allow students to understand that some of the issues about the nature of science arose in the seventeenth century with the birth of modern science. To achieve this purpose, it is important to discuss the different factors that immersed the birth of modern science. To accomplish this goal, the novel "The Name of the Rose" by Umberto Eco may be used. Beyond introducing issues surrounding the nature of science, this strategy could help overcome the separation between the arts and humanities in education.

AB  - Students' perceptions of engineering have been documented through studies involving interviews, surveys, and word associations that take a direct approach to asking students about various aspects of their understanding of engineering. Research on perceptions of engineering rarely focuses on how students would portray engineering to others. First-year engineering student teams proposed a museum exhibit, targeted to middle school students, to explore the question "What is engineering?" The proposals took the form of a poster. The overarching research question focuses on how these students would portray engineering to middle school students as seen through their museum exhibit proposals. A preliminary analysis was done on 357 posters to determine the overall engineering themes for the proposed museum exhibits. Forty of these posters were selected and, using open coding, more thoroughly analyzed to learn what artifacts/objects, concepts, and skills student teams associate with engineering. These posters were also analyzed to determine if there were any differences by gender composition of the student teams. Building, designing, and teamwork are skills the first-year engineering students link to engineering. Regarding artifacts, students mentioned those related to transportation and structures most often. All-male teams were more likely to focus on the idea of space and to mention teamwork and designing as engineering skills; equal-gender teams were more likely to focus on the multidisciplinary aspect of engineering. This analysis of student teams' proposals provides baseline data, positioning instructors to develop and assess instructional interventions that stretch students' self-exploration of engineering.

AB  - The Scottish Baccalaureate in Science or Languages is a new qualification, introduced in 2009, currently being undertaken by senior pupils in Scottish schools. To achieve a Baccalaureate, each pupil must complete an Interdisciplinary Project, a research project that bridges two subjects being studied at Advanced Higher level, plus two Advanced Highers. The new qualification is designed to broaden the learner experience, extend subject knowledge and enhance pupils' independent thinking. It will also help pupils develop interpersonal skills, generic skills and confidence. The aim of this article is to describe a model of learning and teaching that demonstrates how fourteen Interdisciplinary Projects for a Baccalaureate in Science could be managed within one school and, through a "whole school approach", be used to enhance pupil learning while embracing the essential elements of the Curriculum for Excellence (CfE), which is designed to produce effective contributors, confident individuals, successful learners and responsible citizens.

AB  - Environmental agencies in most states have an environmental education Web page that can point geography teachers to a variety of opportunities and resources to enhance their teaching. Most states provide linkages to local and national programs such as Project WET and Project WILD, and access to lesson plans and other teaching materials. A number of state agencies have environmental resource centers, teacher workshops, and grant programs for field trips and class projects. A few states have workshops that provide graduate academic credit and special certification. Much of the content of these programs contributes to fundamental geographic education themes as specified in the 1983 "Guidelines in Geographic Education K-12" and "Geography for Life: National Geography Standards 1994".

AB  - Purpose: Science education literature has indicated that teachers do not always feel comfortable teaching socioscientific issues (SSI) that are infused with several social domains. In order to address this problem in teaching SSI, this study is designed to understand and describe the experiences of a science teacher and a social studies teacher, who collaboratively designed and taught an SSI-based environmental ethics class. Research Methods: The purpose of this descriptive case study was to portray how a science and a social studies teacher co-design and co-teach an environmental ethics class. The data collection instruments were interviews, observations, and reflective journals. Thematic analysis of the data was made via a qualitative data analysis software. Findings: The findings indicated that both participants criticized the science curriculum for not being able to address every dimension of SSI. Therefore, they structured their environmental ethics class based on the "triple bottom idea" in order to look at those issues from social, economic, and environmental points of view. One of the highlights of their environmental ethics class was the opportunity given to the students to work on projects they felt passionate about. The participants described their role in the environmental ethics class as a consultant, which was different from traditional settings. Therefore, they no longer provided the content, but rather consulted with their students to explore their vested interests. Implications for Research and Practice: Giving students power to choose their own project topics, the teachers aimed at enhancing the motivation of students in taking pro-environmental actions, as well as developing their own perspective about controversial SSI. Considering the community involvement of the students, this missing piece of students' community involvement and agency in most educational settings was strongly present in the environmental ethics class.

AB  - We are delighted to welcome you to the International Conference on Education and New Developments 2016--END 2016, taking place in Ljubljana, Slovenia, from 12 to 14 of June. Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. Our International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. Our goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2016 received 489 submissions, from 53 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form of Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. It was accepted for presentation in the conference, 133 submissions (27% acceptance rate). The conference also includes a keynote presentation from an internationally distinguished researcher, Professor Dr. Mojca Juriševic, Associate Professor of Educational Psychology, Faculty of Education, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, to whom we express our most gratitude. Also, we give a special thanks to Professor Emerita Nina K. Buchanan, PhD, University of Hawaii, USA and Professor Emeritus Robert A. Fox, PhD, University of Hawaii, USA for the special talk entitled "The Search for New Educational Forms in the United States and its International Implications." This volume is composed by the proceedings of the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2016), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (W.I.A.R.S.) and had the help of our respected co-sponsor and media partner that we reference in the dedicated page. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. To develop the conference program we have chosen four main broad-ranging categories, which also covers different interest areas: (1) In TEACHERS AND STUDENTS: Teachers and Staff training and education; Educational quality and standards; Curriculum and Pedagogy; Vocational education and Counseling; Ubiquitous and lifelong learning; Training programs and professional guidance; Teaching and learning relationship; Student affairs (learning, experiences and diversity; Extra-curricular activities; Assessment and measurements in Education. (2) In PROJECTS AND TRENDS: Pedagogic innovations; Challenges and transformations in Education; Technology in teaching and learning; Distance Education and eLearning; Global and sustainable developments for Education; New learning and teaching models; Multicultural and (inter)cultural communications; Inclusive and Special Education; Rural and indigenous Education; Educational projects.

AB  - In the new ecohydrology major at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), students learn about the relationships between hydrologic mechanisms and ecological patterns and processes in watersheds and aquatic systems. The curriculum provides students with the option of meeting the requirements for federal positions as a hydrologist (GS 1315) and is designed to provide physical scientists with a strong secondary emphasis in ecology. This paper describes the development of this novel undergraduate degree in ecohydrology and some of the challenges involved in its development and implementation. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - This manuscript asks questions about what may be the naturalized, or taken for granted, ideologies in science education regarding religion. There have been times in history when religion has taken a dogmatic role in limiting the practices of science (e.g., the Roman Catholic Church and Galileo). This manuscript reflects on the dogmatic rule of religion and argues that now science may be in danger of imposing dogmatic ideals through reaching beyond the capacities of an empirical way of knowing. A Science, Technology, and Society (STS) approach to science teaching is considered as a possible mechanism for honoring both science and religion as valid yet different ways of knowing and better addressing students' integration of science learned in school into their everyday lives.

AB  - This study explores "integration", the gathering of multiple disciplines of study into a curricular whole, and "interdisciplinarity", the inclusion of multiple disciplines, in the agricultural college at a land-grant university. We also evaluate the importance that employers place on student abilities to integrate information across disciplines. Interdisciplinary education is important because it provides undergraduates with a balanced educational experience and prepares them to face increasingly more complex and global issues. Survey questionnaires were administered to undergraduate students and faculty advisors in the college of Agricultural sciences and Natural resources at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and to potential employers in agriculture-related fields. Results indicated that employers placed broad knowledge and the ability to integrate information above technical skills. In turn, students chose employment potential as a prime motivator for selection of their majors and minors. Advisors reported that they frequently used interdisciplinary methods in courses, but did not believe the same happened in courses taught by other faculty. Further, the surveys revealed that students perceived the influence of advisors in their choice of majors and minors as minimal. We conclude that interdisciplinary education should receive higher priority in the undergraduate curriculum in agriculture because it is important in student preparation for a more diversified workplace. Such a focus for undergraduates would help to develop the qualities of broad knowledge and integration ability sought by today's employers. (Contains 9 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Maybe it's the peculiar way they walk or their cute little suits, but students of all ages are drawn to penguins. To meet younger students' curiosity, the authors adapted a middle-school level, penguin-themed curriculum unit called Save the Penguins (Schnittka, Bell, and Richards 2010) for third-grade students. The students loved learning about penguins that live all over the world and in various climates. This three-day interdisciplinary science unit allows students to explore their own ideas about penguins, temperature, and heat. The students even used engineering to design miniature dwellings to protect models of South African penguins from climate change and attacks by gulls. Specifically, the objectives of the unit are for students to (1) describe where penguins live, some features of warm and cold climate penguins, and the climate issue affecting penguin populations; (2) compare the temperatures for each given sample of material and describe which materials prevent heat transfer the best; (3) construct a small shelter for a penguin-shaped ice cube so that at least half the penguin mass remains after being placed in a thermal oven for 20 minutes; and (4) describe that heat travels more slowly through some materials than others and that light is reflected by some colors and absorbed by others to make the material hot. The authors used the 5E Learning Cycle model (BSCS 1989) to achieve these objectives because it is a proven method of teaching science. (Contains 3 figures, 2 resources and 5 online resources.)

AB  - This is a process article for weaving indigenous and mainstream knowledges within science educational curricula and other science arenas, assuming participants include recognized holders of traditional ecological knowledge (we prefer "Indigenous Knowledge" or "Traditional Knowledge") and others with expertise in mainstream science. It is based on the "Integrative Science" undergraduate program created at Cape Breton University to bring together indigenous and mainstream sciences and ways of knowing, as well as related Integrative Science endeavors in science research, application, and outreach. A brief historical outline for that experiential journey is provided and eight "Lessons Learned" listed. The first, namely "acknowledge that we need each other and must engage in a co-learning journey" is explained as key for the success of weaving efforts. The second, namely "be guided by Two-Eyed Seeing" is considered the most profound because it is central to the whole of a co-learning journey and the article's discussion is focussed through it. The eighth lesson, "develop an advisory council of willing, knowledgeable stakeholders" is considered critical for sustaining success over the long-term given that institutional and community politics profoundly influence the resourcing and recruitment of any academic program and thus can help foster success, or sabotage it. The scope of relevance for Two-Eyed Seeing is broad and its uptake across Canada is sketched; the article also places it in the context of emerging theory for transdisciplinary research. The article concludes with thoughts on why "Two-Eyed Seeing" may seem to be desired or resisted as a label in different settings. "Traditional Indian education is an expression of environmental education par excellence." It is an environmental education process that can have a profound meaning for the kind of modern education required to face the challenges of living in the world of the twenty-first century (Cajete (2010), p. 1128, emphasis as in original). As two-eyed seeing implies, people familiar with both knowledge systems can uniquely combine the two in various ways to meet a challenge or task at hand. In the context of environmental crises alone, a combination of both seems essential (Aikenhead and Michell (2011), p. 114).

AB  - Modern biological sciences require practitioners to have increasing levels of knowledge, competence, and skills in mathematics and programming. A recent review of the science curriculum at the University of Queensland, a large, research-intensive institution in Australia, resulted in the development of a more quantitatively rigorous undergraduate program. Inspired by the National Research Council's "BIO2010" report, a new interdisciplinary first-year course (SCIE1000) was created, incorporating mathematics and computer programming in the context of modern science. In this study, the perceptions of biological science students enrolled in SCIE1000 in 2008 and 2009 are measured. Analysis indicates that, as a result of taking SCIE1000, biological science students gained a positive appreciation of the importance of mathematics in their discipline. However, the data revealed that SCIE1000 did not contribute positively to gains in appreciation for computing and only slightly influenced students' motivation to enroll in upper-level quantitative-based courses. Further comparisons between 2008 and 2009 demonstrated the positive effect of using genuine, real-world contexts to enhance student perceptions toward the relevance of mathematics. The results support the recommendation from "BIO2010" that mathematics should be introduced to biology students in first-year courses using real-world examples, while challenging the benefits of introducing programming in first-year courses.

AB  - I present a witty solution in this article about how we may obtain data simply and cheaply from physical experiments, with which we can do counting, as well. To this interdisciplinary task I turn to Delphi for help, in which we can program a digital video as a multimedia element. I show an example from the programming of plain multimedia elements until we get to the first efficient step in the processing of the video. High-school students who are learning programming in Delphi are able to understand the presented source code because it is not too complicated. A bibliography is included.

AB  - Prior research from the field of science communication shows that, upon reading journalistic articles about novel scientific findings, readers who recognize the tentative nature of the findings rate the journalistic article that reports these findings as less credible. Apparently, readers' appraisal is influenced by misconceptions about the relationship of text credibility and the tentativeness of research findings. In four experimental studies (N = 301; N = 481; N = 68; N = 69) to test how this negative association might be overcome, we used different settings (online, laboratory), various samples (American, German), and different scientific topics (Deep Brain Stimulation, hypnotherapy, oceanic plastic pollution). We provided participants either with a refutation text that confronted the misjudgment of scientific tentativeness or with a control text. Refutation texts supported people in overcoming these misconceptions and even affected their behavior. Our results contribute to closing the gap between science communication and education, and carry important implications for practical implementation and further research.

AB  - An interdisciplinary team of science and education faculty at the University of Illinois at Chicago and several Chicago-area community colleges developed and implemented a series of four integrated, inquiry-based science courses for preservice elementary school teachers. All four courses are based on guiding principles taken from the rich literature on constructivist teaching and learning of science developed in recent decades. Further, their content and pedagogy align with national and state standards (National Academy of Sciences 1997; NRC 1996, 1997). This article describes each course and elaborates on a particular principle, sharing representative examples of how this principle is enacted in that course. (Contains 8 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - We are delighted to welcome you to the International Conference on Education and New Developments 2015-END 2015, taking place in Porto, Portugal, from 27 to 29 of June. Education, in our contemporary world, is a right since we are born. Every experience has a formative effect on the constitution of the human being, in the way one thinks, feels and acts. One of the most important contributions resides in what and how we learn through the improvement of educational processes, both in formal and informal settings. Our International Conference seeks to provide some answers and explore the processes, actions, challenges and outcomes of learning, teaching and human development. Our goal is to offer a worldwide connection between teachers, students, researchers and lecturers, from a wide range of academic fields, interested in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues. We take pride in having been able to connect and bring together academics, scholars, practitioners and others interested in a field that is fertile in new perspectives, ideas and knowledge. We counted on an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, which can supplement our view of the human essence and behavior, showing the impact of their different personal, academic and cultural experiences. This is, certainly, one of the reasons we have many nationalities and cultures represented, inspiring multi-disciplinary collaborative links, fomenting intellectual encounter and development. END 2015 received 528 submissions, from 63 different countries, reviewed by a double-blind process. Submissions were prepared to take form as Oral Presentations, Posters, Virtual Presentations and Workshops. It was accepted for presentation in the conference, 176 submissions (33% acceptance rate). The conference also includes a keynote presentation from an internationally distinguished researcher, Professor Dr. Martin Braund, Adjunct Professor at Cape Peninsula University of Technology in Cape Town, South Africa and Honorary Fellow in the Department of Education at the University of York, UK, to whom we express our most gratitude. This volume is composed by the proceedings of the International Conference on Education and New Developments (END 2015), organized by the World Institute for Advanced Research and Science (W.I.A.R.S.) and had the help of our respected media partners that we reference in the dedicated page. This conference addressed different categories inside the Education area and papers are expected to fit broadly into one of the named themes and sub-themes. To develop the conference program we have chosen four main broad-ranging categories, which also cover different interest areas: (1) In TEACHERS AND STUDENTS: Teachers and Staff training and education; Educational quality and standards; Curriculum and Pedagogy; Vocational education and Counseling; Ubiquitous and lifelong learning; Training programs and professional guidance; Teaching and learning relationship; Student affairs (learning, experiences and diversity); Extra-curricular activities; Assessment and measurements in Education. (2) In PROJECTS AND TRENDS: Pedagogic innovations; Challenges and transformations in Education; Technology in teaching and learning; Distance Education and eLearning; Global and sustainable developments for Education; New learning and teaching models; Multicultural and (inter)cultural communications; Inclusive and Special Education; Rural and indigenous Education; Educational projects. (3) In TEACHING AND LEARNING: Educational foundations; Research and development methodologies; Early childhood and Primary Education; Secondary Education; Higher Education; Science and technology Education; Literacy, languages and Linguistics (TESL/TEFL); Health Education; Religious Education; Sports Education. (4) In ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES: Educational policy and leadership; Human Resources development; Educational environment; Business, Administration, and Management in Education; Economics in Education; Institutional accreditations and rankings; International Education and Exchange programs; Equity, social justice and social change; Ethics and values; Organizational learning and change. The proceedings contain the results of the research and developments conducted by authors who focused on what they are passionate about: to promote growth in research methods intimately related to teaching, learning and applications in Education nowadays. It includes an extensive variety of contributors and presenters, who will extend our view in exploring and giving their contribution in educational issues, by sharing with us their different personal, academic and cultural experiences.

AB  - Interdisciplinary research and education (IDRE) holds center stage in current academic discussions. Despite the widespread agreement on the promises of IDRE, barriers for effective IDRE implementation remain significant. This study explored the opportunities and challenges of IDRE in integrated soil and water sciences at the Pennsylvania State University through a faculty survey and an educational project. The study revealed that: (1) co-advising graduate student is a common practice as a means of IDRE, and the overall positive aspects out-weigh the negative aspects; (2) joint faculty appointments receive mixed reactions, and are viewed by some as advantageous for the university but difficult for the faculty; (3) people issues are absolutely a critical aspect of successful IDRE; however, IDRE could also be accomplished by small groups or individuals; (4) synergistic approaches have not yet been commonly implemented, because IDRE collaborations often consist of faculty continuing piece-meal contributions independent of one another; (5) a new/renewed interdisciplinary undergraduate program in integrated soil and water sciences remains questionable as a viable solution to the declining undergraduate enrollment; (6) a potential new and broader graduate program appears to be promising, with a possible target on the emerging Critical Zone science (an interdisciplinary science that advocates the holistic studies of the Earth's near-surface environments, which extend from the top of vegetations to the bottom of aquifers); and (7) reward system needs to be enhanced to truly facilitate IDRE, and should be considered as a focus from both administration and practicality points of view. It is hoped, through such a study, that more true synergies can be realized through enhanced IDRE in academic environments. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)

AB  - Mobilizing scientific knowledge for understanding the natural world and for critically appraise socio-scientific situations and make decisions are key competencies for today's' society. Therefore, it is essential to understand how students at the end of compulsory schooling use scientific knowledge for understanding the surrounding world. The objective of this study is to understand how students construct a scientifically oriented explanation while making sense of a phenomenon related to health. We analysed 526 answers to a question of a Portuguese national 9th grade science exam. The results reveal that most students present difficulties in explaining a phenomenon related to health supported by logical and clear reasoning, and in mobilizing scientific knowledge for connecting different scientific domains. We reaffirm the need to reconceptualize the role of health education within science education. Developing reading, writing and discussion activities related to health, which requires the use of scientific knowledge from different domains, would facilitate students' understanding and appropriation of scientific knowledge and its transference. This is a fundamental competence for promoting active and informed citizenship.

AB  - Online learning (e-learning) has a nascent but established history. Its application to interprofessional education (IPE), however, is relatively new. Over the past 2 decades the Internet has been used increasingly to mediate education. We have come past the point of ""should" we use the Internet for education" to ""how should" we use the Internet for education." Research has begun on the optimal development of online learning environments to support IPE. Developing online IPE should follow best practices in e-learning generally, though there are some special considerations for acknowledging the interprofessional context and clinical environments that online IPE is designed to support. The design, development, and deployment of effective online IPE must therefore pay special attention to the particular constraints of the health care worker educational matrix, both pre- and postlicensure. In this article we outline the design of online, interprofessional health sciences education. Our work has involved 4 educational and 4 clinical service institutions. We establish the context in which we situate our development activities that created learning modules designed to support IPE and its transfer into new interprofessional health care practices. We illustrate some best practices for the design of effective online IPE, and show how this design can create effective learning for IPE. Challenges exist regarding the full implementation of interprofessional clinical practice that are beginning to be met by coordinated efforts of multiple health care education silos.

AB  - Students majoring in non-STEM fields often identify introductory biology courses as irrelevant and overly rigorous. Resistance to enroll in a required general education science course, coupled with negative attitudes toward the subject, can adversely affect the academic performance of students; this can especially be present in students from under-represented minority groups. Therefore, instructors have to intentionally design a curriculum that overcomes these factors as they educate non-major students enrolled in introductory biology. BioArt, a learning community, was formed between introductory biology and introduction to graphic design courses to improve the attitudes and academic performance of students in the biology course at a Historically Black College and University (HBCU). The BioArt model incorporated a common theme, project-based learning, and opportunities for experiential learning. To measure outcomes, traditional examinations, non-traditional assessments, failure/withdraw rates, and student attitudes were evaluated. Using this model, introductory biology became less intimidating, more relevant, and improved academic success among freshman minority students. Thus, the BioArt model can be utilized as an intervention at different institutions of higher learning.

AB  - I analyse module outlines within a particular school of social sciences located in a faculty of education, and uncover the evolving systems of teaching social sciences in a teacher education curriculum. The data are analysed through two theoretical lenses: firstly, through the lense of models of teacher education and professional development, and secondly, through the lense of multicultural and multi-disciplinary studies. The analysis reveals that a new language around social sciences is still in the early stages of development, drawing its main referencing from the official policy of the National Curriculum Statement. Unable to develop an independent new language, the social sciences in teacher education tend to capitulate to external dominant forces. There is little evidence of engaging with a critical discourse around the potential of teacher education, resulting in a perpetuation of an applied science notion of professional growth. The juxtaposing of existing disciplinary boundaries constitutes the character of the delivery of the social sciences. I point to a "pedagogy of hope" which focuses on the future rather than on the present status of marginalisation of the social sciences in a teacher education curriculum. The paper offers a way to develop a "Creole", a language and a discourse around the social sciences in general, for teacher education in particular.

AB  - The National Science Education Standards in the United States advocate liberal, contextual, and cultural goals for science education including the significant historical and cultural aspects of science; however, scant treatment is given to the pendulum. Suggests a more routine incorporation of the history and philosophy of science into preservice and inservice courses for science teachers. (Author/SJR)

AB  - The aim of this research is to develop principles for a pedagogy of risk in socio-scientific issues. Risk is challenging to teach because of its contested conceptual basis incorporating epistemic and non-epistemic values, its situated nature and its mathematical basis in probability and statistics. In our project--"Promoting Teachers' Understanding of Risk in Socio-scientific Issues" (TURS)--we have built a set of mature software tools designed through an epistemological analysis of risk and consideration of teaching and learning, as reflected in discussions with teachers. This software provides teachers with tools that enable them to express what they see as the significant issues, giving feedback for them to re-draft their models in the light of the consequences of their decisions. Pairs of science and mathematics teachers have modelled a scenario based on personal decision-making for a surgical intervention. Inductive analysis of teacher dialogue has generated four key findings: teaching risk lends itself to a multi-disciplinary approach; recognition of the multi-dimensional nature of risk can be elicited through engagement with contextualised biological dilemmas; use of executable models promotes discussion of the complexity of risk, and expressive tools can be designed which support coordinated analysis of the multi-dimensional nature of risk.

AB  - In modern business environments, work and tasks have become more complex and require more interdisciplinary skills to complete, including collaborative and computing skills for website design. However, the computing education in Taiwan can hardly be recognised as effective in developing and transforming students into competitive employees. In this regard, the author adopted collaborative learning (CL) with initiation and self-regulated learning (SRL) with feedback to develop students' collaborative skills and regular learning habits and further contribute to practical computing skills for website design. This study comprised an experiment that included 279 second-year university students from five class sections, including four experimental groups (CISF group, n = 57; CIS group, n = 53; CI group, n = 68; C group, n = 68), and a control group (T group, n = 33). The results reveal that students who received the combined treatment of online CL with initiation and SRL with feedback attained the best grades for their computing skills for website design among the five groups. The author further discusses the implications for teachers, schools and educators who plan to design practical scenarios and online learning activities for their students.

AB  - The present study takes an interdisciplinary mathematics-physics approach to the acquisition of the concept of angle by children in Grades 3-5. This paper first presents the theoretical framework we developed, then we analyse the concept of angle and the difficulties pupils have with it. Finally, we report three experimental physics-based teaching sequences tested in three classrooms. We showed that at the end of each teaching sequence the pupils had a good grasp of the concept of angle, they had truly appropriated the physics knowledge at play, and many pupils are enable to successfully grasp new physics situations in which the angle plays a highly meaningful role. Using a physics framework to introduce angles in problem situations is then pertinent: by interrelating different spaces, pupils were able to acquire skills in the domains of mathematics, physics, and modelling. In conclusion, we discuss the respective merits of each problem situation proposed. (Contains 22 figures and 6 tables.)

AB  - The rich, interdisciplinary tradition of learning styles is markedly absent in information systems-related research. The current study applies the framework of learning styles to a common educational component of many of today's information systems curricula--object-oriented systems development--in an effort to answer the question as to whether one's learning style, when matched with a specific complementary instructional methodology, results in increased domain-specific performance. The data collected from 196 information systems majors enrolled in object-oriented systems development courses suggest that task performances increases significantly when the instructional methodology closely mirrors the student's learning style inclination.

AB  - The polygraph (lie detector) may be an ideal vehicle for converting aspects of a physiology course into an interdisciplinary course, enabling discussion of interrelationships between science, technology and society (STS) and social dilemmas arising from technological developments. The authors present a way of incorporating the polygraph into a pre-service teacher education physiology course. They briefly present the scientific, technological and social aspects of the polygraph as well as a suggested sequence of suitable lessons and activities. Some of the activities presented here are laboratory experiments using "hands on" approach and ICT. (Contains 4 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - The interdisciplinary approach that science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) projects inspire in both teachers and students "brings to light a larger picture that promotes real-world scientific applications, which has in turn been shown to increase undergraduate persistence in STEM." The high school students have been warned repeatedly that they must prepare themselves for jobs and career fields that may not yet even exist. These warnings have resulted in an increased emphasis on cooperative problem solving, innovative solution writing, and technological skill acquisition across the curricula of secondary schools. By pairing mathematics and technology classes together in unique ways, students can see firsthand what those futuristic jobs may demand. At Unionville High School in Kennett Square, PA, calculus teacher Dori Ray requires her advanced placement calculus students to build three-dimensional solids of known cross-section out of layers of hand-cut foam. The process is very similar to the process technology and engineering teachers have used for years to make 3-D models from sheet goods using laser cutters, vinyl sign cutters, CNC routers, and manual processes. These activities allowed the calculus students to be exposed to engineering applications of a classic calculus problem. (Contains 7 figures.)

AB  - In January 2011, a review about teacher education in Scotland included 50 recommendations designed to improve the learning of young people in Scotland. A feature of the recommendations was enhancement of teacher education via new national initiatives and strengthened partnerships between schools, local authorities and universities. The Scottish Baccalaureate is a new national initiative that could be used as a method for implementing recommendations made by Donaldson. The aim of this report is to describe a model of learning and teaching involving the Baccalaureate in Science that demonstrates how 14 Interdisciplinary Projects could be managed within a semi-rural secondary school and, through a "whole-school" approach, be used to enhance pupil learning and teacher education while encouraging partnerships between the school and outside agencies. While this model addresses recommendations made by Donaldson, it also embraces the essential elements of Curriculum for Excellence. (Contains 1 table, 6 figures, and 6 online resources.)

AB  - Research in the United States show that professional learning (PL) can improve classroom instruction. However, teachers, especially educators in the content areas, receive insufficient training specific to meeting the language and academic needs of English learners (ELs). The purpose of the current randomized controlled trial (RCT) study was to introduce a high-quality PL program for supporting middle school teachers in teaching science to ELs through classroom observations, so as to evaluate whether in-service science teachers' instructional delivery can be shaped by intensive, structured, and ongoing PL. Results indicated that after receiving PL, treatment teachers allocated a significantly higher portion of their instructional time in teaching content language, developing students' expressive language skills, small group and pair activities, implementing strategies evidenced to effective with ELs, and providing more opportunities for students to participate in hands-on activities that were content-related and grade-appropriate. Practical implications for PL were discussed for an international audience.

AB  - This paper describes the development of different lesson plans dealing with authentic and controversial socio-scientific issues in the framework of climate change. These lesson plans orient themselves along the socio-critical, problem-oriented approach to science teaching. They deal with the use of bioethanol as an alternative fuel and with the phenomenon of climate change itself. The development of these lesson plans for chemistry classes using Participatory Action Research will also be discussed. Parallel approaches to Physics, Biology and Politics education taken in the project "Climate Change Before the Court" will also be outlined briefly. Experiences from applying these lesson plans in German chemistry teaching are also discussed. (Contains 6 figures and 1 table.)

AB  - Funded by innovative programs at the National Science Foundation and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Richmond faculty in biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and computer science teamed up to offer first- and second-year students the opportunity to contribute to vibrant, interdisciplinary research projects. The result was not only good science but also good science that motivated and informed course development. Here, we describe four recent undergraduate research projects involving students and faculty in biology, physics, mathematics, and computer science and how each contributed in significant ways to the conception and implementation of our new Integrated Quantitative Science course, a course for first-year students that integrates the material in the first course of the major in each of biology, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, and physics.

AB  - The evolution of science is seldom about solitary individuals busy at work in labs making discoveries. This is especially true of the Earth sciences, where time-intensive fieldwork is usually required. Single scientists are rarely capable of amassing the requisite data sets to form grand, unifying theories. This is the case with the new airburst theory put forth by a large team of interdisciplinary scientists, including geologists, chemists, and anthropologists, who are trying to help explain several mysteries involving climate change and extinctions. The airburst theory, alternately known as the Younger Dryas impact or Clovis comet hypothesis, potentially explains four events: (1) Could a meteor entering the Earth's atmosphere around 12,900 years ago be responsible for the mass extinction of the megafauna of North America--the large sloths, mastodons, woolly mammoths, and saber-toothed cats found in the fossil record?; (2) Could this meteor also have caused the end of the Clovis culture, the first well-established Paleo-Indians in North America associated with a particular projectile point?; (3) Could this meteor have put enough debris into the atmosphere to bring about what's called the "big freeze," or the Younger Dryas, a geologically brief cold climate that occurred approximately 12,800 to 11,500 years ago?; and (4) Could this meteor have hit the massive ice sheet over North America, sending smaller particles ricocheting off the ice to form the elliptical depressions collectively called the Carolina Bays? The debate really got started when a diverse team of scientists published an article postulating the connection among the four previously unexplained historical events described above (Firestone et al. 2007). The article was cited in a case study in a nontechnical textbook widely used in university courses (Keller and Blodgett 2008). The authors decided to turn the case study into a lesson plan for middle school students to teach Earth science concepts, along with a bit of archaeology, astronomy, and something about the nature of scientific discovery. The lesson plan is about posing the four questions above and having students find and evaluate evidence to explain each event and then engage in critical thinking to see how the events might all be connected through an emerging theory. An early version of the lesson plan became a piece of action research and was piloted in three eighth-grade middle school classrooms. The lesson is also linked with the newest science education standards. (Contains 2 figures, 18 resources and 12 online resources.)

AB  - The importance of engaging students in science and helping them to become informed citizens has been highlighted by many groups invested in science education. This report describes a project that furthers both academic and civic goals through the integration of a service learning component into an undergraduate course. This nonmajors class covers the biology underlying the use of genetic information in today's society and provides students with the opportunity to discuss related ethical and political issues. The service learning project itself involved the creation of instructional materials dealing with the above topics and issues for use in local secondary school classrooms. Students developed materials in a digital media format to allow for revision in response to peer and community feedback. Outcomes of this pilot project suggest benefits to undergraduates as well as high school educators and students. Interdisciplinary collaborations and local educational partnerships have also been developed and strengthened through this work. (Contains 3 figures, 7 tables, and 1 footnote.)

AB  - The Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) believes that fundamental change is possible in the tradition-bound world of college and university science education and recently announced new grants to empower individual scientist-educators--the HHMI Professors--to develop innovative approaches for changing the way they teach biology to undergraduates. Central to the Professors program is the goal of connecting contemporary scientific research and teaching, particularly at large research universities. Another key objective for the Professors is to identify exceptional strategies for meeting the needs of students in the sciences. The HHMI also sought to support faculty who could organize and present the latest knowledge and approaches to modern science to undergraduates. In September 2002, the HHMI announced the appointment of 20 research-active university faculty members as HHMI Professors, who will each receive $1 million over 4 yr to undertake creative initiatives in undergraduate and, in some cases, precollege science education. Although the Professors' projects are each unique, and many address a range of objectives and approaches, aspects of their work can be summarized in five illustrative categories: (1) Student-faculty research groups; (2) Research courses; (3) Interdisciplinary science education; (4) New science teaching tools; and (5) Student mentoring and broadening access. The HHMI plans to encourage the Professors to become national resources and promote broad dissemination of their activities and results to the science education community.

AB  - Recent calls for reform in undergraduate biology education have emphasized integrating research experiences into the learning experiences of all undergraduates. Contemporary science research increasingly demands collaboration across disciplines and institutions to investigate complex research questions, providing new contexts and models for involving undergraduates in research. In this study, we examined the experiences of undergraduates participating in a multi-institution and interdisciplinary biology research network. Unlike the traditional apprenticeship model of research, in which a student participates in research under the guidance of a single faculty member, students participating in networked research have the opportunity to develop relationships with additional faculty and students working in other areas of the project, at their own and at other institutions. We examined how students in this network develop social ties and to what extent a networked research experience affords opportunities for students to develop social, cultural, and human capital. Most studies of undergraduate involvement in science research have focused on documenting student outcomes rather than elucidating how students gain access to research experiences or how elements of research participation lead to desired student outcomes. By taking a qualitative approach framed by capital theories, we have identified ways that undergraduates utilize and further develop various forms of capital important for success in science research. In our study of the first 16 months of a biology research network, we found that undergraduates drew upon a combination of human, cultural, and social capital to gain access to the network. Within their immediate research groups, students built multidimensional social ties with faculty, peers, and others, yielding social capital that can be drawn upon for information, resources, and support. They reported developing cultural capital in the form of learning to think and work like a scientist--a scientific "habitus." They reported developing human capital in the forms of technical, analytical, and communication skills in scientific research. Most of the students had little, direct interaction with network members in other research groups and thus developed little cross-institutional capital. The exception to this trend was at one institution that housed three research groups. Because proximity facilitated shared activities, students across research groups at this institution developed cross-lab ties with faculty and peers through which they developed social, cultural, and human capital. An important long-term concern is whether the capital students have developed will help them access opportunities in science beyond the network. At this point, many undergraduates have had limited opportunities to actually draw on capital beyond the network. Nevertheless, a number of students demonstrated awareness that they had developed resources that they could use in other scientific contexts.

AB  - Concept inventories, consisting of multiple-choice questions designed around common student misconceptions, are designed to reveal student thinking. However, students often have complex, heterogeneous ideas about scientific concepts. Constructed-response assessments, in which students must create their own answer, may better reveal students' thinking, but are time- and resource-intensive to evaluate. This report describes the initial meeting of a National Science Foundation-funded cross-institutional collaboration of interdisciplinary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education researchers interested in exploring the use of automated text analysis to evaluate constructed-response assessments. Participants at the meeting shared existing work on lexical analysis and concept inventories, participated in technology demonstrations and workshops, and discussed research goals. We are seeking interested collaborators to join our research community. (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.)

AB  - After providing some glimpses of his private life, Peter Fensham, a leading figure of the prestigious Faculty of Education, Monash University (and now emeritus professor at Queensland University, Brisbane, Australia), gives some suggestions about the conditions that help students to learn meaningfully. He began his career in the field of physical chemistry and then became an international authority in science education. His dedication to students and commitment to teaching a learner-centered science is palpable in many of his comments. This interview touches on many of the themes he addressed in numerous studies and research: the curriculum, the qualities of the expert teacher, and the decline of standards in schools. Although he is a supporter of a constructivist approach to teaching chemistry, he criticizes the extreme views of constructivism and explains the origin of his inner strength that made him a champion of "science for all".

AB  - In recent years, citizen science projects have emerged as a means to involve students in scientific inquiry, particularly in the fields of ecology and environmental science. A citizen scientist is "a volunteer who collects and/or processes data as part of a scientific inquiry" (Silverton 2009, p. 467). Participation in citizen science fosters an appreciation for the diversity of scientific fields (i.e., conservation biology, ornithology). The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports citizen science projects as a means to recruit future generations into the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines by directly involving students in scientific research. Teachers have expanded citizen science projects to include not only gathering and analyzing data but also civic participation and action (Zaikowski and Lichtman 2007; Ryken et al. 2008). This effectively merges hard sciences with social sciences. In this article, the authors present the multidisciplinary Project Citizen approach to teaching and learning science and engaging students in action-oriented citizen science. Project Citizen, a curricular program administered by a national network of coordinators in every state, promotes competent and responsible civic participation by giving students a vehicle to influence and monitor public policy (Center for Civic Education 2009). High school teachers can adapt Project Citizen as an approach for teaching a variety of subject areas. English teachers can use Project Citizen to emphasize speech and writing skills; social studies teachers can emphasize civic ideas and practices; and mathematics and science teachers can focus on analytical thinking and scientific inquiry.

AB  - Paul F-Brandwein was a visionary who looked at education broadly. He left us with an insightful view of the ecology of education in which he identified three ecological systems: school-family-community, postsecondary, and cultural. The first part of this lecture, by Dean B. Bennett, examines Brandwein's ideas related to environmental education and explores the relationship of environmental education with science teaching in the K-12 school-family-community ecosystem. Focusing particularly on the middle-secondary level, evidence suggests that the goals of environmental education, since their emergence in the late 1960s, are today strongly evident in science curricula, instructional resources, educational  assessment, and teacher education. But the author points out that more must be done and provides some fundamental suggestions. The second part of the lecture, by Sheila K. Bennett, examines the role of distance education in the teaching of science in the postsecondary ecosystem and addresses its value as a viable tool in promoting scientific literacy. The lecture focuses on a successful statewide, interdisciplinary laboratory science course delivered by interactive television, the Internet, and computer network. Now in its ninth year, the course reflects Brandwein's thinking about effective classroom teaching and is based on national standards for scientific literacy.

AB  - Latest standards-based reform documents from mathematics and science education organizations and communities bring forward one important issue--higher-order thinking skills, namely reasoning. In this article, we share our experiences and our approach to developing an integrated course for mathematics and science prospective teachers centered on fostering reasoning with the use of technology. This study took place in an integrated mathematics and science methods course. The prospective teachers were career changers with STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) backgrounds. A sociocultural theoretical approach framed this study, wherein learning is evident in the constructed and enacted plans to engage STEM students in reasoning. The analysis of prospective teachers' reflections and integrated lesson plans suggested that the structure of the course scaffold with minilesson study helped prospective teachers extend their view of reasoning and consider reasoning when planning lessons in the future.

AB  - Problem solving, interpersonal skills, information literacy, and critical and independent thinking are essential qualities that employers seek, yet many undergraduates lack. We structured an interdisciplinary classroom and experiential learning environment where students from three undergraduate courses (Hospitality and Tourism Management, Landscape Architecture, and Forestry and Natural Resources) designed a sustainable community master plan by investigating the economic, social, and environmental components of a U.S. highway relocation project. Interdisciplinary teams of students were charged with a "problem" that was articulated in the form of a Request for Proposals (RFP). This RFP served as the basis for the group work, which required an interdisciplinary approach. The ability of students to work together to complete the project was analyzed using the construct of synergistic knowledge development (SKD), a process by which a group constructively integrates diverse perspectives of individual group members. We posited that SKD would increase over the semester and that SKD would be influenced by various team dynamics such as task conflict, psychological safety, social interaction, attitudes toward problem-based learning (PBL) in a team setting, and behavioral styles of team members. Assessment of SKD and the variables hypothesized to influence it were assessed via a survey administered after the initial phase of the project and a post-project survey. Results confirmed how social interaction, psychological safety, and attitudes toward PBL in a team setting influence SKD.

AB  - Introduction: This study describes the intellectual landscape of iSchools and examines how the various iSchools map on to these research areas. Method: The primary focus of the data collection process was on faculty members' current research interests as described by the individuals themselves. A co-word analysis of all iSchool faculty members' research interests was used as a research method. The relations between the current research profiles of the iSchools were compared by calculating the cosine similarity between co-word profiles and visualized in network graphs. Results: The results show that the iSchools still contain many dominant themes from library and information science, but have an expanded conceptual landscape with the introduction of new iSchools. The methods used for data collection guaranteed the most current data available (in contrast to using publications) and the methods used for analyses gave multiple perspectives to the research landscape of the iSchools. Conclusions: The results of the present study showed how the current research landscape of the iSchools and the shared research interests were built by many topics that still reflect dominant information science topics (e.g., bibliometrics, information retrieval, and information seeking behaviour), but that there are also growing areas that reflect the iSchools' interdisciplinary composition, thus answering the research questions.

AB  - Achieving a sustainable future requires that individuals adopt sustainable behaviors, which are often learned and cemented at a young age. Yet, traditional education efforts have been inadequate in fostering transformative change, in part because many programs focus on fact-heavy, teacher-centered techniques while neglecting the practices that behavioral and sustainability scholars highlight as central to creating change. To address this gap, the pre-sent research integrates three critical yet mostly disparate bodies of research--educational pedagogy, behavior change, and sustainability competencies. This interdisciplinary approach to education was implemented and evaluated with a small group of students during an intensive summer program and year-long case study. The curriculum focused on food and waste behaviors and utilized experiential, real-world, problem-based methods in order to increase competence in sustainability and promote pro-environmental actions. The impact of the program was assessed through surveys, interviews, videos, and participant observations. The data showed that significant changes in knowledge and behaviors were achieved, while suggesting that social knowledge in terms of food is more resistant to change as compared to that of waste. Throughout the year, students maintained significant behavior changes in terms of their waste decisions; however, sustainable food behaviors were more resistant to long-term change due to the students' social and cultural environment. This article will detail the education program and assessment techniques while highlighting each student's unique characteristics, barriers to change, and motivations for action.

AB  - Educators in many disciplines recognize interdisciplinary teaching as effective for student learning. This article provides a model for developing an interdisciplinary literacy and science study with states of water as the core scientific study with corresponding literacy strategies. Authors have included suggestions for children's literature as well as science experiences to use with this study. This water model provides teachers a base for developing studies that integrate their literacy and science curricula. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - In search of methods that improve the efficiency of teaching and training in organizations, several authors point out that mass customization (MC) is a principle that covers individual needs of knowledge and skills and, at the same time limits the development costs of customized training to those of mass training. MC is proven and established in the economic sector, and shows high potential for continuing education, too. The paper explores this potential and proposes a multidisciplinary, pragmatic approach to teaching and training in organizations. The first section of the paper formulates four design principles of MC deduced from an examination of economics literature. The second section presents amit[TM], a frame for mass customized training, designed according to the principles presented in the first section. The evaluation results encourage the further development and use of mass customized training in continuing education, and offer suggestions for future research. (Contains 2 figures and 5 tables.)

AB  - This article begins by examining whether "science" and "religion" can better be seen as distinct or related worldviews, focusing particularly on scientific and religious understandings of biodiversity. I then explore how people can see the natural world, depending on their worldview, by looking at two contrasting treatments of penguin behaviour, namely that provided in the film "March of the Penguins" and in the children's book "And Tango Makes Three." I end by drawing some initial conclusions as to what might and what might not be included about religion in school science lessons. Science educators and teachers need to take account of religious worldviews if some students are better to understand the compass of scientific thinking and some of science's key conclusions. It is perfectly possible for a science teacher to be respectful of the worldviews that students occupy, even if these are scientifically limited, while clearly and non-apologetically helping them to understand the scientific worldview on a particular issue.

AB  - Science Across the World is an exchange programme between schools world-wide. It has two main components: existing resources for students (age 6-10) and a database with all participating schools. The programme exists since 1990. It is carried out in partnership with the British Association of Science Education (ASE) and international pharmaceutical industry GlaxoSmithKline and is growing rapidly. This paper deals with the Science Across the World programme in Teacher Training in three countries: the Netherlands, Ireland and Germany. It shows how international collaboration can be fostered by participation in the programme. Amsterdam Teacher Training College in the Netherlands offers Science Across the World as an elective course to Dutch and European Erasmus students, who work in international interdisciplinary groups. They study the Science Across the World website and choose a topic to study in more detail. Later they write an implementation plan for their teaching practice school. At University College Cork in Ireland Science Across the World is part of a (Higher Diploma in Education) course on Science teaching methodology. Participating students implement the programme in their teaching practice schools. An elaborate research was carried out to investigate the success of this implementation. Teachers are enthusiastic about possibilities the programme offers and suggest an in-service training course on the programme and methodology. The government of the State of Hessen, Germany has just started a new concept in Biology methodology. The government decided to base Teacher Training in Biology on "Competencies and Standards." With increasing globalisation in the next decades the largest, easy to use, global exchange programme Science Across the World can help to achieve aims if modern education in all countries. Teacher Training can help with training student teachers in international collaboration on school level. The triangle Teacher Training--Science Across the World--Research should be promoted.

AB  - Problem-based learning (PBL) is an instructional design approach for promoting student learning, understanding and knowledge development in context rich settings. Previous PBL research has primarily focused on face-to-face learning environments, but current technologies afford PBL designers the opportunities to create online, virtual, PBL environments. The GlobalEd 2 Project is an example of a PBL environment that combines the positive characteristics of both face-to-face and online environments in a 14-week simulation of international negotiations of science advisors on global water resource issues. The GlobalEd 2 PBL environment is described examining the impact it has had on middle school students' interest in future science education experiences, self-efficacy related to writing in science and self-efficacy related to technology use for academic purposes using a pre-test post-test design. Analyses using ANOVAs of gain scores and ANCOVAs of subgroup differences demonstrate a positive impact on the science interest and self-efficacy of 208 middle-grade students from urban and suburban schools.

AB  - As networked digital information proliferates and modern society's need to have access to information irrespective of location rises, the education needed for the digerati, defined loosely as the digital intelligentsia, the whole class of "expert" digital information professionals, becomes an important area about which all information professionals should stay informed. This paper describes the three concepts--interdisciplinarity, interactivity, and interoperability--that are an integral part of digital library research and their use in the curriculum development, teaching, and learning of a specific area of study within Library and Information Science (LIS), namely knowledge organization (KO). KO, studied intellectually, self-referentially, and immersively, it is argued, can provide the foundation for the modern digerati. (Contains 3 tables and 5 footnotes.)

AB  - Establishing a process for identifying evidence-based practices (EBPs) in special education has been a significant advance for the field because it has the potential for generating more effective educational programs and producing more positive outcomes for students with disabilities. However, the potential benefit of EBPs is bounded by the quality, reach, and maintenance of implementation. The cross-disciplinary field of implementation science has great relevance for translating the promise of EBPs into positive outcomes for children and youth with disabilities. This article examines the history, extent, and limitations of EBPs and describes the emergence and current state of implementation science as applied in special education. Subsequent articles in this special issue of "Exceptional Children" address a range of issues related to implementation science in special education: the research-to-practice gap, dissemination and diffusion, adherence and sustainability, scaling up, a model for state-level implementation, and fostering implementation through professional development.
